<h2>Name</h2>

<p>The word <em>coemeterium</em> or <em>cimiterium</em> (in Gr. <em>koimeterion</em>) may be said in early literature to be used exclusively of the burial places of <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. A single <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> example (Corp. Inscript. Lat., VIII, n. 7543), where it seems to be applied to a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> sepulture, can safely be disregarded, and though the word, according to its etymology, means sleeping place (from <em>koimasthai</em>, to sleep), its occurrence in this literal sense is rare. Moreover, the phrase "their so-called cemeteries" (<em>ta kaloumena koimeteria</em>), used in an imperial edict of 259, shows that it was even then recognized as a distinctive name. The word occurs in <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De anima, c. li) and is probably older. Let us add that though what we now understand by a cemetery is a separate, park-like enclosure not being the "yard" of any church, the word was originally of much more general application. It was applied either to any single <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> or to a whole graveyard, and was the usual term employed to designate those subterranean burial places now commonly known as the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>.</p>

<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>There can be little <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in the beginning of the preaching of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the converts to the Gospel were content to be <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> without distinction in the graves of their Jewish brethren (<a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs6">Acts 5:6</a>, <a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs2">8:2</a>, and <a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs37">9:37</a>). But it is also plain from the nature of things that this arrangement could not have been of long duration. To the <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> the dead body and all connected with it was an uncleanness. To the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> it involved no contamination, but was full of the hope of <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>. (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs43">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>). The practice of separate interment must, therefore, have begun early both in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in other places where there were large <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> colonies. It would seem that the earliest <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> burial places were <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> vaults (to use a rather misleading word) erected upon private <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. But the desire to rest near those of their own <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> who had passed away before must have been especially strong in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where even artisans practising the same trade sought to be buried side by side with their fellow-craftsmen and formed associations for the purpose. Wealthy <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> accordingly enlarged their <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> burial places and admitted their poorer brethren to share them. "For himself, for his freedmen, and for charity" (<em>sibi et libertis et misericordi&aelig;</em>) is an inscription found in a construction of this class. Partly owing to the nature of the soil, partly, no doubt, to the desire of imitating the burial places in the neighbourhood of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and in particular the sepulchre of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the practice was largely followed of excavating a subterranean chamber or series of chambers in the recesses of which bodies could be laid and walled in with bricks or marble slabs. The need of interring a disproportionately large number of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> upon one small <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> probably led to the early development of a system of narrow galleries tunnelled through the tufa, with horizontal niches (loculi) scooped out in the walls on both sides. At the same time it would be a mistake to suppose that <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> throughout the Roman Empire were compelled to resort to great secrecy regarding their interments. On the contrary, the well-understood principle of law that a burial place was a <em>locus religiosus</em> and consequently inviolable seems at normal times to have guaranteed to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> a large measure of immunity from interference. The <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> College of Pontiffs possessed over all places of sepulture no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> caused difficulties, especially at those epochs when active <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out, but the general tendency of the Roman magistrates was to be tolerant in religious matters. Moreover it is probable that for many years after the Gospel was first preached in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were looked upon merely as a particular <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as we may learn from Horace and other pre-Christian writers, had long held a recognized and assured position which excited no alarm.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Hence from Apostolic times down to the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> were <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> upon private burial allotments, situated like the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> along the border of the great roads and of course outside the walls of the city. Moreover, as Lanciani says, "these early <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> whether above or below ground, display a sense of perfect security and an absence of all fear or solicitude" (Lanciani, <a href="11388a.htm">Pagan</a> and Christian <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 309). The <a href="15387a.htm">vestibule</a> and <a href="04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the Flavians, members of <a href="05114b.htm">Domitian's</a> own <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, afford a conspicuous example of this. The ground, bordering on the Via Ardeatina, belonged to <a href="06098b.htm">Flavia Domitilla</a>, the niece of <a href="05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. Here a <a href="03417b.htm">catacomb</a> was excavated, a portion of which seems to have been set aside for the interment of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. The entrance can plainly be seen from the road, and the <a href="15387a.htm">vestibule</a> and adjoining chambers still remain in which, according to Roman custom, anniversary feasts took place in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the dead. In this case the feasts would have been the <em>agap&aelig;</em>, or <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> feasts of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, probably preceded or followed by the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>; but the custom of honouring the third, ninth (afterwards seventh), thirtieth, and anniversary day of the decease seems to have been borrowed from the religious observances of <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to date from the earliest times. In contrast to these original private <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> the portion of the <a href="03417b.htm">catacomb</a> excavated for the use of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community at large consisted of a vast network of galleries dug at more than one level. For a while, like many other underground <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemeteries, this <a href="03417b.htm">catacomb</a> seems to have been known by the name of the donor, <a href="06098b.htm">Domitilla</a>, but later it was called after the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> <a href="10751a.htm">Nereus and Achilleus</a>, who were subsequently buried there. Further, towards the close of the fourth century a <a href="02325a.htm">basilica</a> in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of these two <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was erected upon the spot. Their <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> was near the entrance and consequently it was not disturbed, but the ground was dug away and the church built immediately over the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a>, much below the level of the surrounding soil. On the other hand, through devotion to these <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> interments multiplied and numerous fresh galleries for the purpose were excavated in the immediate vicinity of the church. All this is typical of what took place in many other instances. The early burial places, which were certainly in private ownership and confined to isolated plots of ground (<em>are&aelig;</em>), seem in the third century to have often become <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> held by the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community in common, other adjoining allotments being bought up and the whole area honeycombed with galleries at many different levels. We learn from the "Philosophumena" that <a href="15756c.htm">Pope Zephyrinus</a> appointed Callistus (c. 198) superintendent of the cemeteries. So again we have distinct record of the restoration of the cemeteries to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> in 259 after the <a href="15256b.htm">Valerian</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.13</a>) According to <a href="04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> the freedom which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at normal times enjoyed in their possession was due to the fact that the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> banded themselves together to form a <em>collegium funeraticium</em>, or burial <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, such associations, of which the members paid a certain annual contribution, being expressly recognized by <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. (See Roma Sotterranea, I, 101 sq.) For this view there is very good evidence, and though objections have been raised by such authorities as Monseigneur Duchesne and Victor Schultze, the theory has by no means been abandoned by later scholars. (See Duchesne, Histoire ancienne de l'&eacute;glise, I, 384; Marucchi, El&eacute;ments d'arch&eacute;ologie, I, 117-124.)</p>

<p>When <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were thus buried, crowds of their fellow-Christians desired to be buried near them; moreover, some sort of open space forming a small chamber or <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> was generally opened out where Mass could be celebrated upon or beside the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a>. Still, this was only an occasional use. The <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, owing to difficulties of light and ventilation, were not ordinarily used as places of <a href="15710a.htm">Christian worship</a> except at times of fierce <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. After Constantine's edict of toleration (312), when peace was restored to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> were sometimes built over portions of the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, especially over the known burial place of some favourite <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. At the same time, during the fourth century the eagerness to be <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> in these subterranean galleries gradually waned, though the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="04613a.htm">Pope Damasus</a> in honouring the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> seems to have revived the fashion for a few years at a later date. After 410, when <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was sacked by Alaric, no more burials took place in the <a href="03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a>, but the earlier spread of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is well illustrated by the excavations made. Any accurate estimate is of course impossible, but Michael de Rossi calculated that in the zone of territory lying within three miles of the walls, more than five hundred miles of subterranean galleries had been tunnelled and that the number of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> buried therein must have exceeded 1,700,000. The use of open-air cemeteries in place of <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a> had probably begun in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> before <a href="04295c.htm">Constantine</a>. Many have been identified in modern times (<a href="04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Roma Sotterranea, vol. III, bk. III), though it is not always easy to determine exactly the period at which they started. In other parts of the world it is quite <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that innumerable open-air <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemeteries were in existence long before the close of the period of persecutions. We may cite as characteristic the discoveries of Dr. W. M. Ramsay in Phrygia, where many <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> graves clearly belong to the second century, as also those of Northern Africa, of which we hear already in <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, and in particular those of <a href="14207a.htm">Salona</a> in <a href="04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> (second to sixth century; see Leclercq, Manuel d' arch&eacute;ologie, I, 327-329). This last is particularly interesting because the surviving remains illustrate so clearly the extreme antiquity of the practice of interring the dead in the near neighbourhood of the <a href="11271a.htm">oratories</a> in which the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> assembled to offer the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. It is probably to this custom that we may trace the origin of the lateral <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> which have become so notable a feature of all our greater churches No <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> the tendency to surround the church with graves was long kept in check by the <a href="09079a.htm">Roman law</a> forbidding the dead to be <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> within the walls of cities; but this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> began to be disregarded, and after the pontificate of <a href="08422a.htm">John III</a> (560-575) it would seem that burials at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> generally took place within the walls.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As a rule the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, though their cemeteries were separate, accommodated themselves in things permissible to the burial usages of the peoples among whom they lived. Thus in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> the early <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic Christians</a> converted their dead into mummies with the use of asphalt and natron. Again, though <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a> existed far away from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in many places where the soil favoured such excavations, e.g. in <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, still, in certain tracts of country otherwise suitable, e.g. in Umbria, the early <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> abstained from this method of interment, apparently because it was not used by the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> inhabitants (see N. M&uuml;ller in Realencyklopadie f. prot. Theol., X, 817).</p>

<h2>Burial in churches</h2>

<p>The fact that the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were probably the earliest altars (cf. <a href="../bible/rev006.htm#vrs9">Revelation 6:9</a>), together with the eager desire to be buried near <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> holy ones, gradually led up to the custom of permitting certain favoured <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> to be <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> not only near but within the church. It may be said that the Roman emperors led the way. Constantine and <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> were buried under the portico of the church of the Apostles in Constantinople. At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when the restrictions against burial within the city began to be set aside, the entrance of St. Peter's became the usual place of interment for the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and other distinguished <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. It was no doubt in imitation of this practice that King Ethelbert of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> was persuaded by <a href="02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> to dedicate a church to Sts. Peter and Paul outside the town, with the intent "that both his own body and the bodies of his episcopal successors and at the same time of the kings of Kent might be laid to rest there". They were in point of fact buried in the <a href="15387a.htm">vestibule</a>. Probably a varying phase of the same tendency may be recognized in the practice of erecting little shelters or <a href="11271a.htm">oratories</a>, <em>basilic&aelig;</em>, over certain favoured graves in the open. The Salic law prohibited outrages upon such <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> under heavy penalties: "Si quis basilicam super hominem mortuum exspoliaverit 1200 denarios culpabilis iudicetur", i.e. "If any one shall plunder a <a href="02325a.htm">basilica</a> erected over the dead he shall be fined 1200 denarii" (cf. Lindenschmidt, Handbuch d. deutsch. Alterthumskunde, I, 96). But interment within the church itself had been known from an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> in isolated cases. <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> allowed his brother Satyrus, although he was a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>, to be buried within the church beside the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>. As for himself, he wished to be buried under the altar of his own basilica. "Hunc ego locum (sc. sub altari) praedestinaveram mihi. Dignum est enim ut ibi requiescat sacerdos ubi offerre consuevit", i.e. "This place (beneath the altar) I had chosen for myself. For it is fitting that where the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> has been wont to sacrifice, there should he rest (<a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., XVI, 1023). In the earlier periods, however, when we hear of burial in churches we may as a rule presume that the cemetery <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> are meant (cf. <a href="04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Roma Sotterranea, III, 548 sq.), and for a long time the resistance made to the growing practice of burial in churches was very determined. Of the numerous <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees upon the subject that of <a href="16078b.htm">Vaison</a> in 442 may be taken as a specimen. "According to the tradition of our ancestors", it says, "measures must be taken that on no account should anyone be buried within the churches, but only in the yard or in the <a href="15387a.htm">vestibule</a> or in the annexes [<em>exedris</em>]. But within the church itself and near the altar the dead must on no account be buried." This <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> with others of similar purport was afterwards incorporated in the canon law. As may be learned from <a href="07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> it was frequently disregarded in the case of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and royal personages, but on the other hand we have record of many other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and other distinguished men both in the sixth century and later who were buried <em>juxta urbem</em>, or <em>in campis</em>, or <em>in communi coemeterio</em>. <a href="01093a.htm">St. Acca</a> might be mentioned as an English example in point. None the less in the first half of the ninth century the serious abuses attendant upon the neglect of this prohibition were constantly complained of. The passage in the capitularies of Theodulfus (c. 790) is particularly interesting because it was afterwards translated into Anglo-Saxon (c. 1110) in the following form:</p>

<blockquote><p>It was an old custom in these lands often to bury departed men within the church and to convert into cemeteries [<em>lictunum</em>] the places that were hallowed to <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> worship and blessed for offering to Him. Now it is our will that henceforth no man be buried within a church unless it be some man of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> [<em>sacerdhades</em>] or at least a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> of such <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> that it is known that he by his meritorious deeds earned when living such a place for his dead body to rest in. It is not our intention however that the bodies which have been previously buried in the church should be cast out but that the graves which are seen therein be either dug deeper into the earth or else be levelled up and the church floor be evenly and decently laid so that no grave [<em>nan byrgen</em>] be any longer apparent. But if in any place there be so many graves that it is impossible to effect this, then let the place be left as a cemetery [<em>Thonne l&aelig;te man tha stowe to lictune</em>] and the altar be taken from thence and set in a clean [i.e. new] place and a church be there raised where people may offer to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> reverently and decently. (Thorpe, Eccles. Institutes and Laws, 472) </p></blockquote>

<p>This <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> plainly shows both that the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> against burying within the churches had often been disregarded in the past and also that any attempt to enforce it rigidly was looked upon as impracticable. No one could determine the precise degree of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> which merited a relaxation, and in most countries those whose dignity, wealth, or benefactions enabled them to press their claims with vigour had little difficulty in securing this coveted privilege for themselves or for their friends. The English liturgist, John Beleth, seems to admit that any <em>patronus ecclesi&aelig;</em>, i.e., the patron of a living, could claim to be buried in the church as a right, and his words are adopted by Durandus, though possibly without a full appreciation of their meaning. Still, such lay interments within the sacred building and especially in the <a href="03572b.htm">chancel</a> always stood in contradiction to the canon law, and some show of resistance was generally made. In particular, it was insisted on that <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> should not project above the pavement or should at least be confined to the side <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries continued to recognize the right of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to be buried within the sacred building, but it need hardly be remarked that the intervention of state legislation in almost all modern countries has deprived these decrees of much of their practical importance.</p>

<h2>Medieval cemeteries</h2>

<p>When the tribes of the North were first <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> an effort was generally made to restrain the converts from being buried in the barrows used by the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>. This does not seem to have been the case to the same extent when the Gospel was preached to the Romanized Gauls. There, says <a href="02713b.htm">Boulanger</a> (Le mobilier funeraire gallo-romain et franc, 27), the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> Roman will often be seen resting side by side. "Glass with biblical subjects or pottery bearing <a href="08042a.htm">Christian inscriptions</a> may be found next door to a grave which contains the obol intended for Charon." In the <a href="06238a.htm">Frank</a> and Saxon interments there is not usually this confusion of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. At the same time, the national burial custom, which required the warrior to be buried with his arms and the girl with her ornaments and the implements of her daily occupation, was long observed even by <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The temptation which this custom offered for the rifling of graves was viewed with much disfavour by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and under <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> council passed a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> which seems to have been effective in putting an end to this burial with accoutrements (<a href="02713b.htm">Boulanger</a>, op. cit., 41). Still <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims</a>, in 857, found it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to issue a whole series of instructions <em>De sepulcris non violandis.</em> In all these early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemeteries the orientation of the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> was carefully attended to. Each corpse was laid with its feet to the east, though it has been remarked as a curious fact that <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> sepultures also commonly exhibit the same peculiarity (<a href="02713b.htm">Boulanger</a>, op. cit., 32). With regard to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> it may probably be assumed, though clear evidence is lacking, that separate <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> graveyards were formed almost from the beginning in all those places where the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> were numerous. It would seem that even before a church was built it was the practice of our Saxon forefathers to set up a cross, which served as a rendezvous for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the district. An instance may be quoted from the almost contemporary life of St. Willibald, born in 699, who when he was three years old was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> at the foot of such a cross in a remote part of Hampshire. The suggestion has been recently made with much plausibility that round such a cross the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> converts <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> to be laid to rest, and that these primitive crosses marked a site upon which church and churchyard were established at a later time (see Baldwin Brown, Arts in Early <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, I, 254-266). Certain it is that the churchyard cross was always a conspicuous feature of the <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> enclosure and that the churchyard usually afforded sanctuary as secure as that of the church itself for those who were fleeing from <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> or private vengeance. Numerous <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ordinances enjoin that the churchyard was to be surrounded by a wall or other boundary sufficient to keep out straying cattle and to secure the area from profanation. As a specimen we may take the following ordinance of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln in 1229: "Regarding the arrangements of a church-yard [<em>coemeterium</em>] let the ground be properly enclosed with a wall or a ditch, and let no part of it be taken up with buildings of any kind, unless during time of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>. There should be a good and well-built cross erected in the church-yard to which the procession is made on <a href="11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, unless custom prescribes that the procession should be made elsewhere" (Wilkins, Concilia, I, 623). This churchyard procession on <a href="11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, in which, as early as the time of <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was often carried in a portable shrine, as well as all the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the church, was a very imposing <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Many descriptions of it have been left us, and traces still survive even in <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> countries, where, as for example, in <a href="15532a.htm">Wales</a>, the country people to this day often visit the churchyard on <a href="11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> and scatter flowers on the graves (see Thurston, Lent and <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, 213-230; The Month, April, 1896, 378). Less admirable was the use of the churchyard in <a href="10285c.htm">medieval times</a> as a sort of recreation ground or market-place. Numerous decrees were directed against abuses, but it was difficult to draw a clear line between what was legitimate and permissible and what was distinctly a profanation of the sacred precincts. The very fact that people congregated in the churchyard on the way to and from service on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holidays made it a convenient place of assembly. Down to modern times the day of the village feast or fair is often found to coincide with the sometimes forgotten original dedication of the church or with the festival of its <a href="11562a.htm">patron saint</a>. Moreover, there was a tendency to regard the church and its precincts as a sort of neutral ground or place of security for valuables. Hence ancient contracts often include a clause that such and such a sum of money is to be paid on a certain date in a particular church or churchyard. In any case it cannot be denied that the erection of stalls and booths for fairs in the churchyard persisted in spite of all prohibitions (Baldwin Brown, op. cit., 274-364).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>A curious feature found in many churchyards from the twelfth to the fourteenth century, especially in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, is the so-called <em>lanterne des morts</em>, a stone erection sometimes twenty or thirty feet high, surmounted by a lantern and presenting a general resemblance to a small lighthouse. The lantern seems to have been lighted only on certain feasts or vigils and in particular on <a href="01315b.htm">All Souls' Day</a>. An altar is commonly found at the foot of the column. Various theories have been suggested to explain these remarkable objects, but no one of them can be considered satisfactory. Besides the churchyard cross and the <em>lanterne des morts</em>, cemeteries, especially when not attached to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church, frequently contained a mortuary <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> similar to those with which modern usage is still familiar. Here, no doubt, Mass was offered for the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed, and the dead were on occasion deposited, when for some reason the service at the graveside was delayed. These mortuary <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> seem usually to have been dedicated to <a href="10275b.htm">St. Michael</a>, probably from the function attributed to him of escorting the dead to and from the judgment seat (cf. the <a href="11217a.htm">Offertory</a> in the requiem Mass: "Signifer sanctus Michael repraesentet eas in lucem sanctam". In other graveyards a "lych-gate", i.e., a roofed gateway to the cemetery, served to afford shelter to the coffin and mourners when waiting to proceed to the graveside. Provision was also generally made, and some such arrangement is recommended by the decrees of more modern times, for the bestowal of bones which might be dug up in making new graves. Most churchyards possessed something in the nature of a charnel house or ossuary, and in many parts of the world, where for various reasons space had to be economized, a principle was recognized that after a certain term of years graves might be emptied to make room for new occupants, the remains thus removed being consigned to the charnel house. This was and is particularly the case in regions where, owing to the unsuitable nature of the soil, e.g. in the <a href="10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a>, the dead are built into oven-like chambers of solid masonry. When these chambers are cleared at intervals to receive another occupant, it is not unusual to find here and there a body which instead of falling to dust has become naturally desiccated or mummified. Such gruesome specimens have not unfrequently been sold and without a particle of foundation exhibited as "walled up <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>" or "victims of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>". (See The Month, Jan., 1894, pp. 14, 323, 574, and April, 1904, p. 334.) Among the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> and some other orders in Southern <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> charnel houses are often constructed with the most fantastic elaboration, the bodies, dried to the consistency of parchment, being arranged around the chamber in niches and robed in their religious habits. Moreover, even here, secular <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, following <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> precedents, have been admitted in some cases to share the sepulture of the religious. The curious practices observed in many ancient cemeteries, for instance in the arcade known as the <em>Charnier</em> of the Cemetery of the Innocents at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, would afford much matter for discussion, but lie outside the limits of the present article. A very favourite decoration for such erections or for cemetery walls was the <a href="04617a.htm">Dance of Death</a>, otherwise known as the <em>Danse Macabre.</em> The frescoes of this character, however, seem none of them to be older than the fourteenth century.</p>

<h2>Monastic cemeteries</h2>

<p>From an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> every religious house possessed a cemetery of its own. An interesting discovery of such a graveyard belonging to Anglo-Saxon <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the eighth century was made a few years ago near Hull. It is possible that these monastic cemeteries in early missionary days often formed the nucleus of a churchyard intended for all the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. In any case it became the ardent desire of many <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> to be laid to rest among the religious of monastic institutions, and they often sought to purchase the privilege by benefactions of various kinds. Formal compacts dealing with this matter are to be met with among early charters, e.g. those of Anglo-Saxon <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; and the question, as will easily be understood, led to much friction at a somewhat later date, between the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, resulting in a great deal of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation upon the right of choosing a sepulture and the claims of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>.</p>

<h2>Consecration of cemeteries</h2>

<p>The practice of blessing the grave or the vault in which any <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> was laid to rest is extremely ancient, and it may be traced back to the time of <a href="07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> (De Gloria Conf., c. civ). In many early pontificals, e.g. those of <a href="05326a.htm">Egbert of York</a> and <a href="13097a.htm">Robert of Jumi&egrave;ges</a>, a special service is provided with the title <em>Consecratio Cymiterii</em>, and this, with certain developments and additions, is still prescribed for the blessing of cemeteries at the present day. According to this rite five wooden crosses are planted in the cemetery, one in the centre and the others at the four points of the compass. After the chanting of the <a href="09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a> with special invocations, <a href="07432a.htm">holy water</a> is blessed and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> makes the circuit of the enclosure sprinkling it everywhere with this water. Then he comes to each of the crosses in turn and recites before it a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> of some length, these five <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> being identical with those appointed for the same purpose in the Anglo-Saxon pontificals of the eighth century. Candles are also lighted before the crosses and placed upon them, and this feature, though not so ancient as the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, is also of venerable antiquity. On each of these occasions <a href="07716a.htm">incense</a> is used, and finally a consecratory preface is sung at the central cross, after which the procession returns to the church., where solemn Mass is celebrated. A cemetery which has thus been <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> may be profaned, and it is in a measure regarded as losing its sacred character when any deed of blood or certain other outrages are committed within its enclosure. For example, as the ground has been blessed for those who are in communion with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the forcible intrusion of someone who had died under the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> ban is looked upon as a violation which unfits it for the purpose for which it was designed. <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> decided that in such a case, if for any reason it was impossible to exhume the remains and cast them out of the enclosure, the cemetery must be reconciled by a form of service specially provided for the purpose. In a celebrated instance, known as the Guibord Case, which occurred in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, in 1875, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, seeing the <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> uphold the intrusion, laid the portion of the cemetery so profaned under an <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Finally we may note the quasi-consecration imparted to the famous Campo Santo of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, as well as to one or two other Italian cemeteries, by the alleged transference thither of soil from Mount Calvary.</p>
