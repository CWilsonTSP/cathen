<p>Prince-Archbishop of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, born at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 6 Oct., 1797; died there 24 Nov., 1875. He received his earlier <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> at the gymnasium in <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, devoting himself chiefly to the study of <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>; he also gave much time to the study of poetry, and many examples of his verses have survived. Later his desire to enter <a href="11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> was opposed by his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, but he finally overcame their objections.</p>

<p>After his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> he was appointed <a href="04570a.htm">curate</a> in H&uuml;tteldorf, and later professor of <a href="07365a.htm">church history</a> and Canon law at <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, where Friedrich Prince Schwarzenberg, director of the Oriental Academy at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, was among his pupils. In January, 1849, <a href="13595a.htm">Cardinal Schwarzenberg</a> named his former teacher Prince-Bishop of Sekkau, "in recognition of his distinguished qualities, <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and services". In this capacity Rauscher performed great services in a short time, introduced pastoral conferences, and restored to the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> their mission houses. He also fostered religious associations, and put an end to the intrigues of the Rongeaner, although important business detained him for the most part in <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Scarcely was he <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> than he hurried to the capital to attend the great episcopal assembly which inaugurated the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revival in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>; between 29 April and 20 June, 1849, twenty-five <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and four episcopal proxies held sixty sessions. The last in order of <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, Rauscher took the most prominent part in the transactions. He laid before the assembly a <em>promemoria,</em> which served as the programme of the business, and drafted five of the seven memorials addressed to the Ministry of the Interior. He also drew up the decrees to serve for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> "as the common rule of their aim and activity". The beautiful pastoral of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was also composed by him. Before the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> separated, they chose a committee of five members for the settlement of the memorials and the arrangement of all current affairs. As the reporter of this committee, he acted at times as its sole agent.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Rauscher was the father of the Austrian Concordat On 14 Sept., 1852, a cabinet order appeared, naming him imperial plenipotentiary for the conclusion of a concordat. The negotiations were long and troublesome; during them Rauscher was named Prince-Archbishop of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and made his solemn entry into the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Stephen on 15 Aug., 1853. To promote the Concordat he found it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to visit <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was engaged in the most difficult negotiations for seven months. He was thus able to take part in the solemnities in connexion with the Definition of the Immaculate Conception. Finally, on 18 Aug., 1855, the Concordat was signed and on 5 Nov., it was published as a law "applicable throughout the empire". For the homogeneous introduction of the concordat sixty-six <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled in <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1856. Rauscher was raised to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> in 1855. By 1 Jan., 1857, <a href="04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>, for which Rauscher composed the celebrated instructions ("Instructio pro indiciis ecclesiasticis"), were established in all the <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>. Provincial <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> prescribed the special application of the Concordat to the individual <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The decrees of the <a href="15417a.htm">Viennese</a> Council of 1858, skilfully directed by Rauscher and ratified by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, still serve as an important form of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> life and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> activity. The <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, both religious and general, as well as the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and associations and art, flourished during the concordat era. Rauscher's magnanimity is revealed by his foundation of the Austrian house for <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, thus giving the citizens of the Hapsburg Empire a home in the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Up to this period Rauscher's <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> had been constructive; after the unfortunate Austrian <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of 1859-66, he found himself compelled to adopt the defensive, since the blame for the defeats was most unjustifiably referred to the Concordat. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and prince-bishops are members of the House of Peers; thus, when the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> on the Concordat opened in the Reichstag in 1861 and its revision was demanded, Rauscher with the other episcopal members of the Upper House deliberated concerning an address to the emperor. When the House of Delegates demanded the removal of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders from the penitentiaries, <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and other state institutions, he declared in the House of Peers: "Since 1859 no effort of artificial agitation has been spared to open a campaign against defenceless <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, who ask of this earthly life only necessities, and serve their fellow-creatures in privations and discomforts. This unworthy agitation bears the stamp of <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but it has likewise in it something cowardly and ignoble, of which even one estranged from <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> should be ashamed." In consequence of the events of 1866, the storm against the Concordat and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> broke out <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a>, and the Press added to its power. When the drafts of the new <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning marriage, the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the interconfessional relations, in respect to which points there were many gaps in the Concordat, came up for discussion in the House of Peers, Rauscher immediately arose and delivered his celebrated speech on the Concordat, urging harmony between the spiritual and <a href="02137c.htm">secular powers</a>. When the decrees had been sanctioned, and the new <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> had been vigorously condemned by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, there arose great dissatisfaction and turmoil. To demonstrate the illogical nature of this agitation Rauscher demanded: "Is it not permissible for a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to pronounce a law <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a>? Every newspaper arrogates to itself the right of stigmatizing the <a href="08010c.htm">injustice</a> of all <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> which do not agree with its partisan views". A little later the pastoral of Bishop Rudigier of <a href="09273a.htm">Linz</a> was seized, and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself subsequently condemned to fourteen days' <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> with costs; the pastoral was to be suppressed. However, Rauscher immediately obtained from the emperor the annulment of the sentence and of the consequences which it entailed with respect to civil <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and relations.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Still greatly excited, the Austrian <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> proceeded to the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> immediately after the raging fight about the Concordat. Rauscher regarded the assembly with the greatest hopes and issued two pastorals dealing with the council on 15 Nov., 1869. <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> appointed him to the important commission <em>pro recipiendis,</em> which had to investigate all motions submitted. At the first real session of the council (the General Congregation of 28 Dec.) he delivered the first address, and twice spoke against the opportuneness of a universal <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a>; the needs and the degrees of culture of the individual peoples were too different. As to the question which finally most strongly stirred the minds of those in and outside the council, that of the <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a> teaching <em>ex cathedra,</em> Rauscher was the leader of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who combatted the expediency of the definition. His work, "Observationes qu&aelig;dam de infallibilitatis ecclesi&aelig; subjecto", appeared at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and was reprinted at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; the author later explained that it "was especially intended to emphasize the fact that the proposed decision would afford parties hostile to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> those subterfuges of which they were in need". In the general debate Rauscher, who was ill, had his speech read by Bishop Hefele; it lasted over an hour, and ends characteristically: "But always shall I adore the ways of the Lord", He repeatedly took part in the special debates (8, 9, and 15 June), and at the ballot in the General Congregation of 13 July he voted <em>non placet</em>. However, he did not sign the memorial of the fifty-five <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the minority to <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on 17 July, <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> he had done all that he should. On 17 July he took leave of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and later, as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decrees of the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. None of the violations of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and abuses of power, which resulted in the complete suppression of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> on 20 September, 1870, passed without Rauscher raising a protesting voice. In May, 1874, the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning the external legal position of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the contributions to the religious funds, and the legal recognition of religious <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> were issued (see <a href="02121b.htm">AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN MONARCHY</a>). With these <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> the religious legislation of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> has found a temporary conclusion.</p>

<p>The term "providential personality", so often misused, may be with complete <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> applied to Cardinal Rauscher; he saved the monarchy the sufferings of a <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>.</em> He was a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> patriot. <a href="02121b.htm">Austria's</a> greatness, power, and glory were the guiding stars of his political activity. Daily he <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a>: "Lord, let me not die before I have fulfilled the task with which Thou hast entrusted me". This moment was now come. On the eve of the Feast of <a href="03445a.htm">St. Catherine of Alexandria</a>, patroness of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies, he had always received the <a href="11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>; on the eve of this feast in 1875 he also died. His body rests in Our Lady's Choir of the Stephanskirche before the steps of the altar. At the wall beneath the Rauscher window is his monument. The <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, representing him with his hands crossed over the breast and clothed in episcopal vestments, portrays his principal characteristic, charity. Besides the monument are the pictures of his <a href="11562a.htm">patron saints</a>, Joseph and Othmar, while all is <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> by a representation of the Risen Redeemer.</p>
