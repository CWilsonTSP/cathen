<p>Founder of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> and Society of St-Sulpice, b. at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 20 Sept., 1608; d. there, 2 April, 1657. At Lyons, where his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> had become administrator of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, he made a thorough classical course under the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1617-25); he was encouraged to become a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, who predicted his <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and great services to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He studied <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of Harcourt, <a href="13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> and patristics at the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. He preached during this period, in virtue of a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> with which his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> had provided him, adopting the ambitious style of the day; he also frequented fashionable <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, causing anxiety to those interested in his spiritual welfare. His success in defending theses in Latin and Greek led him to go to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the purpose of learning Hebrew so as to gain &eacute;clat by defending theses in that language at the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. His eyesight failing, he made a <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Loreto, where he not only obtained a cure, but also a complete conversion to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. For a time he meditated the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> life, visiting <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; the news of his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> death (1631) recalled him to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Refusing a court chaplaincy, with the prospect of high honours, he began to gather the beggars and the poor and catechize them in his home; at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> he collected the poor and the outcast on the streets for instruction, a practice at first derided but soon widely imitated and productive of much good. Under <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul's</a> guidance, he assisted his missionaries, in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the provinces, prepared for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> 21 May, 1633. He became a leader in the revival of religion in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, associating himself with the followers first of St. Vincent and then of P&#232;re de Condren, Superior of the Oratory, under whose direction he passed, though he continued to retain St. Vincent as his friend and advisor. To de Condren, more even, it appears, than to St. Vincent, Olier owed the deepest spiritual influence and many of his leading <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The work de Condren had most at heart was the foundation of <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> after the model laid down at the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The hope of religion lay in the formation of a new <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> through the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. The attempts in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to carry out the designs of the council having failed, de Condren, unable to succeed through the medium of the Oratory, gathered a few young <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> around him for that purpose, Olier among them. The missions in which he employed them were meant to impress on their minds the religious needs of the country; his ulterior purpose was not disclosed till shortly before his death in 1640.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>A first attempt to found a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a> failed. On 29 Dec., 1641, Olier and two others, de Foix and du Ferrier, entered upon a community life at Vaugirard, a suburb of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Others soon joined them, and before long there were eight seminarians, who followed with the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> the same rule of life and were instructed in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, M. Olier teaching <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Vaugirard profited by the presence of the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to take an extended vacation, during which time they reformed his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>. Impressed by the fame of this reform, the cur&eacute; of St-Sulpice, disheartened by the deplorable state of his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, offered it in exchange for some of M. Olier's <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>. In August, 1641, M. Olier took charge of St-Sulpice. His aims were to reform the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, establish a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and <a href="03712a.htm">Christianize</a> the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, then very worldly, through the <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the seminarians who should attend its courses. The <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> embraced the whole Faubourg-St-Germain, with a population as numerous and varied as a large city. It was commonly reputed the largest and most vicious <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, not only in the French capital, but in all <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. The enormity of the evils had killed all hope of reformation. Father Olier organized his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in community life. Those who found the life too strict separated from the work. The <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> was divided into eight districts, each under the charge of a head <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and associates, whose <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> individually all the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> under their care, with their spiritual and corporal needs, especially the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, the uninstructed, the vicious, and those bound in irregular unions. Thirteen <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> centres were established, for the instruction not only of children but of many adults who were almost equally <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of religion. Special instructions were provided for every class of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, for the beggars, the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, domestic servants, lackeys, midwives, workingmen, the aged etc. Instructions and debates on <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> were organized for the benefit of <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, hundreds of whom were converted. A vigorous campaign was waged against immoral and <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> literature and obscene pictures; leaflets, holy pictures, and <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> books were distributed to those who could not or would not come to church, and a bookstore was opened at the church to supply good literature. The poor were cared for according to methods of relief inspired by the practical genius of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. During the five or six years of the Fronde, the terrible civil <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> that reduced <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> to widespread misery, and often to the verge of famine, M. Olier supported hundreds of <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> and provided many with clothing and shelter. None were refused. His rules of relief, adapted in other <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, became the accepted methods and are still followed at St-Sulpice. <a href="11322b.htm">Orphans</a>, very numerous during the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, were placed in good <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and a house of refuge established for <a href="11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls. A home was open to shelter and reform the many <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> rescued from <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> lives, and another for young girls exposed to danger. Many free <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for poor girls were founded by Father Olier, and he laboured also at the reform of the teachers in boys' <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, not however, with great success. He perceived that the reform of boys' <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> could be accomplished only through a new congregation; which in fact came about after his death through <a href="08444a.htm">Saint John Baptist de la Salle</a>, a pupil of St-Sulpice, who founded his first <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in Father Olier's <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>. Free legal aid was provided for the poor. He gathered under one roof the sisters of many communities, who had been driven out of their <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> in the country and fled to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> for refuge, and cared for them till the close of the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>. In fine, there was no misery among the people, spiritual or corporal, for which the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> did not seek a remedy.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>His work for the rich and high-placed was no less thorough and remarkable. He led the movement against <a href="05184b.htm">duelling</a>, formed a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> for its suppression, and enlisted the active aid of military men of renown, including the marshals of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and some famous <a href="05184b.htm">duellists</a>. He converted many of noble and royal blood, both men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. He combated the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> was only for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious, and inspired many to the practices of a devout life, including daily meditation, spiritual reading and other exercises of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, and to a more exact fulfillment of their <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> at court and at home. His influence was powerful with the Queen Regent, Anne of Austria, to whom he spoke with great plainness, yet with great respect, denouncing her prime minister, <a href="10092a.htm">Cardinal Mazarin</a>, as responsible for <a href="14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> and sacrilegious nominations to the episcopate. He persuaded the rich&mdash;royalty, nobles, and others&mdash;to a great generosity, without which his unbounded charities would have been impossible. The foundation of the present church of St-Sulpice was laid by him. At times as many as sixty or even eighty <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were ministering together in the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, of whom the most illustrious, a little after Olier's time, was <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, later <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. This was one of the best effects of Olier's work, for it sent trained, enlightened <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> into all parts of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. From being the most vicious in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> became one of the most devout, and it has remained such to this day. Olier was always the missionary. His outlook was world- wide; his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> led to the foundation of the Sulpician missions at <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and enabled him to effect the conversion of the English King, Charles II, to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, though not to perseverance in a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life.</p>

<p>The second great work of Olier was the establishment of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St-Sulpice. By his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, which he intended to serve as a model to the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, as well as by his <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, he hoped to help give <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> a worthy <a href="13675a.htm">secular priesthood</a>, through which alone, he felt, the revival of religion could come. The <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> was at first installed in the presbytery, but very soon (1 Oct., 1642) removed to a little house in the vicinity, M. de Foix being placed in charge by Father Olier. The beginnings were in great poverty, which lasted many years, for Olier would never allow any revenues from the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> to be expended except on <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> needs. From the start he designed to make it a national <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> and regarded as providential the fact that the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of St-Sulpice and the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> depended directly on the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In the course of two years students came to it from about twenty <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Some attended the courses at the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, others followed those given in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. His seminarians were initiated into <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> work, being employed very fruitfully in teaching <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a>. At the Sorbonne their <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, it appears, had a very marked influence. The <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, fulfilling the hopes of Father Olier, not only sent apostolic <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> into all parts of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, but became the model according to which <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were founded throughout the kingdom. Its rules, approved by the General <a href="01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a> in 1651, were adopted in many new establishments. Within a few years, Father Olier, at the earnest solicitation of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, sent <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to found <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in a few <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the first at <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a> in 1648. It was not his intention to establish a congregation to conduct a number of <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, but merely to lend <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the foundation of a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> to any <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and to recall them after their work was well established. The repeated requests of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, considered by him as indications of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> will, <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to modify his plan, and to accept a few <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> permanently. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> which formed around him at St-Sulpice was not erected into a religious congregation; it continued as a community of <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, following a common life but bound by no special <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, whose aim it should be to live perfectly the life of <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. He wished it to remain a small company, decreeing that it should never consist of more than seventy-two members, besides the superior and his twelve assistants. This regulation remained in force till circumstances induced Father Emery to abolish the limitation.</p>

<p>Father Olier's arduous labours brought on a stroke of apoplexy in February, 1652. He resigned his cure into the hands of M. de Bretonvilliers and on regaining sufficient strength visited watering-places in search of health, by command of his physicians, and made many <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>. On his return to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, his old energy and enthusiasm reasserted themselves, especially in his <a href="15546c.htm">warfare</a> against <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. A second stroke at P&eacute;ray in September, 1653, rendered him thenceforth a paralytic. His last years were full of intense suffering, both bodily and <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a>, which he bore with the utmost sweetness and resignation. They were years of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but indeed the whole life of this servant of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, despite his immense external activity, was a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and his principal devotion was to the inner life of Christ. His visions and his <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> caused the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> to ridicule him as a visionary; but they, as well as all others, acknowledged his <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and the singular purity of his intentions. His numerous <a href="14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writings show him a profound master of spiritual <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and well deserve a close study. His great friend, <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, who was with him at his death, considered him a saint; and Father Faber, in his "Growth in Holiness" (Baltimore ed., p. 376) says of him: "Of all the uncanonized servants of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> whose lives I have read, he most resembles a <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> Saint."
