<p>(Generally called <em>Augustinians</em> and not to be confounded with the <a href="03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>).</p>

<p>A <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order which in the thirteenth century combined several monastic <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> into one, under this name. The order has done much to extend the influence of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, to propagate the Faith, and to advance learning.</p>

<h2>Foundation</h2>

<p>As is well known, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine of Hippo</a>, first with some friends and afterwards, as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, with his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, led a monastic community life. Vows were not <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, but the possession of private <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> was prohibited. Their manner of life led others to imitate them. Instructions for their guidance were found in several writings of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, especially in "De opere monachorum" (P.L., XL, 527), mentioned in the ancient <em>codices regularum</em> of the eighth or ninth century as "The <a href="02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>". Epistola ccxi, otherwise cix (P.L., XXXIII, 958), contains the early "Augustinian Rule for Nuns"; epistolae ccclv and ccclvi (P.L., XXXIX, 1570) "De moribus clericorum". The instructions herein contained formed the basis of the rule which, in accordance with the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Lateran Synod, in 1059, was adopted by canons desiring to practise a common apostolic life (<a href="07397a.htm">Holstenius</a>, "Codex regularum", II, Rome, 1661, 120). Thence the title "Canons Regular of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>". Later, many monastic <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> and brotherhoods, especially in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, adopted the Augustinian Rule, either <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> or by command of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, without, however, giving up certain peculiarities of life and dress introduced by the founder, or handed down by custom. These differences led to their being confounded with other orders (e.g., the <a href="06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>) and gave rise to quarrels. To remedy these evils and to ensure harmony and unity amongst the various religious congregations, <a href="01287b.htm">Pope Alexander IV</a> sought to unite them into one order. For this purpose he commanded that two delegates be sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from each of the <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, to discuss, under the presidency of Cardinal Richard of Santi Angeli, the question of union. The first meeting of the delegates took place on the first of March, 1256, and resulted in a union. <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> Septala of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Prior of the Bonites, was appointed the first prior-general of the new order. A uniform black habit was adopted, and the staves formerly carried by the Bonites to distinguish them from <a href="06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> were dispensed with. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Licet ecclesiae catholicae", issued on 4 May, 1256 (Bullarium Taurinense, 3rd ed., 635 sq.), ratified these proceedings and may be regarded as the foundation-charter of the "Ordo Eremitarum S. Augustini"; and furthermore, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> commanded that all <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which had sent no delegates, should conform to the newly drawn up Constitutions.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Extension of the order</h2>

<p>The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Licet ecclesiae catholicae" mentions the <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> which had been invited to take part in the proceedings at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1256, which led to the union. "Quaedam [domus] S. Guillelmi, quaedam S. Augustini ordinum, nonnullae autem fratris Joannis Boni, aliquae vero de Fabali, aliae vero de Britinis." - According to this statement, the original branches of the <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> were: (1) The <a href="15644b.htm">Williamites</a>, founded by <a href="15633c.htm">St. William of Maleval</a> shortly before his death in 1157. From this congregation sprang two others, the principal houses being at Stabulum Rodis, in the valley of Maleval, and at Fabali on Monte Fabali. The mode of life, originally very severe, was mitigated by <a href="06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a>, under whom the majority of the Williamite <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> adopted the <a href="02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. When these were required by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Licet ecclesiae catholicae" to join the new order, they raised objections and obtained a prohibition to exchange the <a href="02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> for the milder one of the Augustinians. (See Guil. De Waha, "Explanatio vitae S. Guillelmi Magni" etc., 1693; "Acta Sanct. Boll.", Feb., II, 450 sqq.; "Kirchenlex.", 2nd ed., XII, 1609 sqq.) (2) Several unspecified houses of the <a href="07281a.htm">Order of St. Augustine</a>, established chiefly in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and forming separate congregations. To these belong the <a href="07280a.htm">Hermits</a> of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> in <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, who had already been united into an Augustinian congregation by <a href="08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a>, in 1243, with Cardinal Richard for a protector, and with <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> granted to those who visited their churches (in 1244). (3) The Bonites, so called from their founder, Blessed John Buoni, a member of the Buonuomini <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, born about 1168 in <a href="09611b.htm">Mantua</a>. He lived a <a href="07280a.htm">hermit's</a> life at <a href="03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, and died in his native city in 1249 (Lodi, "Vita e miracoli del b. Giov. Buoni", <a href="09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, 1591; "Acta SS. Boll.", Oct., IX, 693 sq.). In the year 1256 the Bonites possessed eleven <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and gave the first general to the Augustinian Order (see above). (4) The Brittinians (Brictinians), so called from their oldest foundation, that of St. Blasius de Brittinis, near <a href="05785a.htm">Fano</a>, in the district of <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. Many congregations, such as the Brothers of Penance of Christ (<em>Saccati</em>, or "Sack-bearers"), the foundations of Durandus of <a href="07513a.htm">Huesca</a> (Osca), and those of the "Catholic Poor", united with the Bonites.</p>

<p>The Hermits of St. Augustine spread rapidly, partly because they did not radiate from a single parent <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and partly because, after violent conflicts in the previously existing congregations, the active life was finally adopted by the greater number of communities, following the example of the <a href="06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. To the Brittinians alone, in 1260, was granted permission to continue following the contemplative life. A few years after the reorganization of the Augustinian Order, <a href="07280a.htm">Hermit</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> sprang up in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> soon possessed forty, many of them large and important, such as those at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, Worms, <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, all built between 1260 and 1270. As early as the year 1299, the German province was divided into four sub-provinces: the Rhenish-Swabian, the Cologne, the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, and the Saxon. At the period of its greatest prosperity the order possessed 42 provinces and 2 vicariates numbering 2000 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and about 30,000 members. (Cf. Aug. Lubin, "Orbis Augustinianus sive conventuum O. Erem. S. A. chorographica et topographica descriptio", Paris, 1659, 1671, 1672.)</p>

<h2>Present condition of the order</h2>

<p>Since the sixteenth century the order, owing to many causes, particularly to the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, lost numbers of <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. During the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the greater part of the 157 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were destroyed, as well as all the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the Discalced Augustinian Hermits. The secularization of the <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> brought about great losses. In 1835, out of a total of 153 in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 105 were suppressed. The Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Mexico were suppressed in 1860; in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, in 1864; in the Kingdom of <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, in 1875. The <a href="12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, however, suffered the heaviest losses, during the disturbances of 1896. Hence the Augustinian Order of today has only a tenth of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which it possessed at the time of its greatest prosperity.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Without counting the Discalced Augustinians, the order comprises 19 provinces, 2 commissariates, 2 congregations, and 60 large <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (with 6 or more fathers), in all, including residences and mission stations, 275 foundations, with 2050 members (priests, <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>, and <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>). These provinces, according to the "Catalogus Fratrum O. Erem. S. Augustini" (Rome, 1908) are:--</p>

<p>The <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of St. Thomas, at <a href="03011c.htm">Alt Br&uuml;nn</a>, <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, and of Our Lady of Good Counsel, Philadelphia, <a href="15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> are <a href="05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the general of the Augustinian Order.</p>

<p>The chief house of the order is the International College of St. Monica at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Via S. Uffizio No. 1. It is also the residence of the general of the order (<em>prior generalis</em>) and of the <em>curia generalis</em>. Another <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Augustinian Hermits in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> is that of S. Augustinus de Urbe, established in 1483, near the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Augustine, in which the remains of St. Monica, the mother of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, were deposited when they were brought from <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a> in the year 1430. This, formerly the chief <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the order, is now occupied by the Italian Ministry of Marine, and the Augustinian Fathers who serve the church retain only a small portion of their former <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. Another Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> is S. Maria de Populo de Urbe.</p>

<p>In 1331 <a href="08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> had appointed the Augustinian Hermits guardians of the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in the Church of S. Pietro in Ciel d'Oro at Pavia. They were driven thence in 1700, and fled to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Their <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> being destroyed in 1799, and the church <a href="04748c.htm">desecrated</a>, the <a href="12734a.htm">remains</a> of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> were taken back to Pavia and placed in its <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In recent times the church of S. Pietro was restored, and on 7 October, 1900, the body of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> was removed from the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and replaced in San Pietro--an event commemorated in a poem by <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>. The Augustinians are again in possession of their old church of S. Pietro.</p>

<h2>Reform movements</h2>

<p>In the fourteenth century, owing to various causes, such as the mitigation of the rule, either by permission of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, or through a lessening of fervour, but chiefly in consequence of the Plague and the <a href="13539a.htm">Great Western Schism</a>, discipline became relaxed in the Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; hence reformers appeared who were anxious to restore it. These reformers were themselves Augustinians and instituted several reformed congregations, each having its own <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (<em>vicarius-generalis</em>), but all under the control of the general of the order. The most important of these congregations of the "Regular Observants" were those of Illiceto, in the district of <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>, established in 1385, having 12, and subsequently 8, <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>; of St. John ad Carbonariam (founded c. 1390), having 14 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, of which 4 still exist; of <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a> (1491), having 11; the Lombardic Congregation (1430), 56; the Congregation of the Spanish Observance (1430), which since 1505 has comprised all the <a href="03410b.htm">Castilian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; of Monte Ortono near Padua (1436), having 6 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>; of the Blessed Virgin at <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, also called Our Lady of Consolation (c. 1470), 25; of Apulia (c. 1490), 11; the German, or Saxon, Congregation (1493) (see next paragraph); the Congregation of Zampani in Calabria (1507), 40; the Dalmatian Congregation (1510), 6; the Congregation of the Colorites, or of Monte Colorito, Calabria (1600), 11; of Centorbio in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (1590), 18 (at present 2, which form the Congregation of S. Maria de Nemore Siciliae); of the "Little Augustinians" of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (c. 1593), 20; of the Spanish, Italian, and French congregations of Discalced, or Barefooted, Augustinians (see below), and the Congregation del Bosco in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> established in the year 1818 and having 3 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>.</p>

<p>Among these reformed congregations, besides those of the Barefooted Augustinians, the most important was the German (Saxon) Congregation. As in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, reforms were begun as early as the fifteenth century in the four German provinces existing since 1299. Johannes Zachariae, an Augustinian <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of Eschwege, Provincial of the Order from 1419-1427, and professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the University of Erfurt, began a reform in 1492. Andreas Proles, <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Himmelpforten <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, near Wernigerode, strove to introduce the reforms of Father Heinrich Zolter in as many Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> as possible. Proles, aided by Father Simon Lindner of <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> and other <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> Augustinians, worked indefatigably till his death, in 1503, to reform the Saxon <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, even calling in the assistance of the secular ruler of the country. As the result of his efforts, the German, or Saxon, Reformed Congregation, recognized in 1493, comprised nearly all the important <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Augustinian Hermits in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Johann von Staupitz his successor, as vicar of the congregation, followed in his footsteps. <a href="14283a.htm">Staupitz</a> had been prior at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, then at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and had taken a prominent part in founding the <a href="15678b.htm">University of Wittenberg</a> in 1502, where he became a professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and the first dean of that faculty. He continued to reform the order with the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Proles, as well as in his spirit and with his methods. He collected the "Constitutiones fratrum eremitarum S. Aug. ad apostolicorum privilegiorum formam pro Reformatione Alemanniae", which were approved in a chapter held at <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> in 1504. A printed copy of these is still to be seen in the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of Jena. Supported by the general of the order, <a href="01171a.htm">Aegidius of Viterbo</a>, he obtained a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> brief (15 March, 1506), granting independence under their own <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the reformed German congregations and furthermore, 15 December, 1507, a <a href="03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> commanding the union of the Saxon province with the German Congregation of the Regular Observants. All the Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of Northern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> were, in accordance with this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, to become parts of the regular observance. But when, in 1510, <a href="14283a.htm">Staupitz</a> commanded all the <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> of the Saxon province to accept the regular observance on pain of being punished as rebels, and to obey him as well as the general of the order, and, on 30 September, published the <a href="03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> at <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, seven <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> refused to obey, among them that of Erfurt, of which <a href="09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> was a member. In fact, <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> seems to have gone to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on this occasion as a representative of the rebellious <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In consequence of this appeal to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the consolidation did not take place. <a href="14283a.htm">Staupitz</a> also continued to favour <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> even after this. They had become acquainted at Erfurt, during a visitation, and <a href="14283a.htm">Staupitz</a> was responsible for <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> summons to <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> in 1508; nay, even after 1517 he entertained friendly sentiments for <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, looking upon his proceedings as being directed only against abuses. From 1519 on he gradually turned away from <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>. <a href="14283a.htm">Staupitz</a> resigned his office of <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the German congregations in 1520. Father Wenzel Link, preacher at <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, former professor and dean of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, who was elected his successor, cast his lot with <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, whose views were endorsed at a chapter of the Saxon province held in January, 1522, at <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. In 1523 Link resigned his office, became a <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> preacher at Altenberg, where he introduced the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and married, and went in 1528 as preacher to <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, where he died in 1547. The example of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> and Link was followed by many Augustinians of the Saxon province, so that their <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> were more and more deserted, and that of Erfurt ceased to exist in 1525. The German houses that remained faithful united with the Lombardic Congregation. There were, however, many Augustinians in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> who by their writings and their sermons opposed the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Among them <a href="01749b.htm">Bartholom&auml;us Arnoldi of Usingen</a> (d. 1532 at <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>), for thirty years professor at Erfurt and one of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> teachers, Johannes Hoffmeister (d. 1547), Wolfgang Cappelmair (d. 1531), and Konrad Treger (d. 1542).</p>

<h2>The Discalced Augustinians &#151; (sometimes called the Barefooted Augustinians, or Augustinian Recollects)</h2>

<p>More fortunate than that of the German (Saxon) province was the reform of the order begun in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the sixteenth century, which extended thence to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The originator of this reform was Father Thomas of Andrada, afterwards called <a href="14695a.htm">Thomas of Jesus</a>. Born at <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, in 1529, he entered the Augustinian Order in his fifteenth year. Although aided in his efforts at reform by the Cardinal Infante Henry of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and his teacher, Louis of Montoya, his plans were impeded at first by the hesitation of his brethren, then by his captivity among the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> (1578), on the occasion of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> of the youthful King Sebastian of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and lastly by his death in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> which took place on 17 April, 1582. The celebrated poet and scholar Fray Luis Ponce de Le&oacute;n (d. 1591), of the Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Salamanca, took up the work of <a href="14695a.htm">Thomas of Andrada</a>. Appointed professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a> in 1561, he undertook the revision of the constitutions of his order and in 1588 Father D&iacute;az, with the support of Philip II, established at Talavera the first <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Spanish Regular Observance. In a short time many new <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Discalced Augustinians sprang up in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and were followed by others in the Spanish colonies. In 1606 Philip III sent some Discalced Augustinians to the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> where, as early as 1565, <a href="15223a.htm">Fray Andr&eacute;s de Urdaneta</a>, the well-known navigator and cosmographer (cf. "La Ciudad de Dios", 1902; "Die katholischen Missionen", 1880, pp. 4 sqq.), had founded the first mission station on the island of <a href="03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>. In a few years, many mission stations of the Discalced Augustinians sprang up in the principal places on the islands and developed a very successful missionary activity. In 1622 <a href="07004b.htm">Pope Gregory XV</a> permitted the erection of a separate congregation for the Discalced, with its own <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. This congregation comprised four provinces: three in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the Philippine province, to which was later added that of <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>. When the Discalced Augustinians in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> were either <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> or <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee, during the revolution of 1835, they continued to flourish in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a> and in South America.</p>

<p>In <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Father Andr&eacute;s D&iacute;az introduced the reformed congregations in 1592, the first house being that of Our Lady of the Olives, at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, which was soon followed by others at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and elsewhere. As early as 1624 <a href="15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> permitted the division of the Italian congregations of Barefooted Augustinians into four provinces (later, nine). In 1626 a house of this congregation was founded at Prague and another at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, in 1631, of which the celebrated <a href="01056a.htm">Abraham a Sancta Clara</a> was a member in the eighteenth century. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, Fathers Fran&ccedil;ois Amet and Matthew of St. Frances, of Villar-Benoit, completed the reform of the order in 1596. The French Congregation of Discalced Augustinians comprised three provinces, of which all the houses were destroyed during the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. As the only <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Calced Augustinian Hermits, St. Monica, at <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, is at present untenanted, there is now not a single Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The Italian Congregation of Discalced Augustinians in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> possess seven houses, six in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and one in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> (Schlusselburg, with a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> in the <a href="03034b.htm">Diocese of Budweiss</a>). The chief house of this congregation is that of <a href="11065a.htm">St. Nicholas of Tolentino</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Via del Corso 45). Including the scattered members of the Spanish congregation in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> and South America, the Discalced Augustinians still number about 600 members. They are independent of the Augustinian general and are divided into two congregations, under two vicars-general.</p>

<h2>Organization of the order</h2>

<p>The Augustinian Hermits, while following the rule known as that of <a href="02079b.htm">St. Augustine</a>, are also subject to the Constitutions drawn up by Bl. Augustinus Novellus (d. 1309), prior general of the order from 1298 to 1300, and by Bl. Clement of <a href="11338a.htm">Osimo</a>. The Rule and Constitutions were approved at the general chapter held at Florence in 1287 and at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1290. A revision was made at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1895. The Constitutions have frequently been printed: at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1581, and, with the commentary of <a href="13729c.htm">Girolamo Seripando</a>, at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in 1549, and at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1553. The newly revised Constitutions were published at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1895, with additions in 1901 and 1907.</p>

<p>The government of the order is as follows: At the head is the prior general (at present, Tom&aacute;s Rodr&iacute;guez, a <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniard</a>), elected every six years by the general chapter. The prior general is aided by four assistants and a secretary, also elected by the general chapter. These form the <em>Curia Generalitia</em>. Each province is governed by a provincial, each commissariate by a commissary general, each of the two congregations by a <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and every <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> by a prior (though the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Alt-Brunn, in <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, is under an <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>) and every college by a <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. The members of the order are divided into <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. The Augustinians, like most <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, have a <a href="03341a.htm">cardinal protector</a> (at present, Mariano Rampolla del Tindaro). The choir and outdoor dress of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> is of black woollen material, with long, wide sleeves, a black leather girdle, and a long pointed cowl reaching to the girdle. The indoor dress consists of a black habit with <a href="13508b.htm">scapular</a>. In many <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> white was formerly the colour of the house garment, also worn in public, in places where there were no <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. Shoes and (out of doors) a black hat complete the costume.</p>

<p>The Discalced Augustinians have their own constitutions, differing from those of the other Augustinians. Their <a href="05789c.htm">fasts</a> are more rigid, and their other ascetic exercises stricter. They wear sandals, not shoes (and are therefore not strictly <em>discalced</em>). They never sing a high Mass. As an apparent survival of the <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> life, the Discalced Augustinians practise strict silence and have in every province a house of recollection situated in some retired place, to which <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> striving after greater perfection can retire in order to practise severe <a href="10578b.htm">penance</a>, living only on water, bread, fruits, olive oil, and wine.</p>

<h2>Privileges of the order</h2>

<p>Privileges were granted to the order almost from its beginning. <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> freed the order from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; <a href="08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, in 1490, granted to the churches of the order <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> such as can only be gained by making the Stations at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> placed the Augustinians among the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> and ranked them next to the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. Since the end of the thirteenth century the <a href="13322a.htm">sacristan</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> palace has always been an Augustinian. This privilege was ratified by <a href="01289a.htm">Pope Alexander VI</a> and granted to the order forever by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> issued in 1497. The present holder of the office is Guglielmo Pifferi, <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Porphyra, <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Vatican <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> (of which the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Paul is the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church). To his office also belongs the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of preserving in his oratory a <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Host which must be renewed weekly and kept in readiness in case of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> illness, when it is the privilege of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="13322a.htm">sacristan</a> to administer the last <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to His Holiness. The <a href="13322a.htm">sacristan</a> must always accompany the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> when he travels, and during a <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> it is he who celebrates Mass and administers the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. He lives in the Vatican with a sub-sacristan and three <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> of the order (cf. <a href="13100b.htm">Rocca</a>, "Chronhistoria de Apostolico Sacrario", Rome, 1605). The Augustinian Hermits always fill one of the chairs of the Sapienza University, and one of the consultorships in the Congregation of Rites.</p>

<p>The work of the Augustinians includes teaching, scientific study, the <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, and missions. The history of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> makes frequent mention of Augustinians who distinguished themselves particularly as professors of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the great <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> of Salamanca, <a href="04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, Alcal&aacute;, <a href="11385b.htm">Padua</a>, <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, Paris, <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="12338a.htm">Prague</a>, <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, Erfurt, Heidelberg, <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, etc. Others taught successfully in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of the order. The order also controlled a number of secondary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, colleges, etc. In 1685 the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, Johann Gottfried II, of Guttenberg, confided to the care of the Augustinians the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> and the gymnasium of Munnerstadt in Lower Franconia (Bavaria), a charge which they still retain. Connected with the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Michael in that place is a <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, while the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> directed by the Augustinians forms another <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, that of St. Joseph. From 1698 to 1805 there existed an Augustinian gymnasium at Bedburg in the district of Cologne. The order also possesses altogether fifteen colleges, academies, and <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and America. The chief institutions of this kind in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> are that at Valladolid and that in the <a href="05534c.htm">Escorial</a>. As a pedagogical writer, we may mention the general of the order Aegidius of Colonna, also called Aegidius Romanus, who died <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a> in 1316. Aegidius was the preceptor of the French king, <a href="12004a.htm">Philip IV, the Fair</a>, at whose request he wrote the work "De regimine Principum". (An extract from this book "on the care of <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of their children" will be found in the "Bibliothek der katholischen P&auml;dagogik", Freiburg, 1904.) Jacques Barth&eacute;lemy de Buillon, a French Augustinian exiled by the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, fled to <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> and began the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of deaf and dumb children. Aegidius of Colonna was a disciple of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, and founded the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> known as the Augustinian, which was divided into an earlier and a later. Among the representatives of the earlier Augustinian <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> (or Aegidians), we may mention besides Aegidius himself (<em>Doctor fundatissimus</em>) <a href="14695c.htm">Thomas of Strasburg</a> (d. 1357), and <a href="07018a.htm">Gregory of Rimini</a> (d. 1358), both generals of the order, and Augustine Gibbon, professor at <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (d. 1676). The later Augustinian <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> is represented by <a href="11103a.htm">Cardinal Henry Noris</a> (d. 1704), Fred. Nicholas Gavardi (d. 1715), Fulgentius Bellelli (d. 1742), Petrus Manso (d. after 1729), Joannes Laurentius Berti (d. 1766), and Michelangelo Marcelli (d. 1804). The following were notable <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>: James of <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> (Giacomo di Capoccio), <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a> and <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> (d. 1308), called <em>Doctor speculativus</em>; Alexander a S. Elpideo (also called Fassitelli or A. de Marchina) (d. 1326), <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Melfi; Augustinus Triumphus (d. 1328); Bartholomew of <a href="15221b.htm">Urbino</a> (also called de Carusis) (d. 1350), <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15221b.htm">Urbino</a>; <a href="07235a.htm">Henry of Friemar</a> (d. 1354); Blessed Herman of Schildesche (Schildis, near Bielefeld) (d. 1357), called <em>Doctor Germanus</em> and <em>Magnus legista</em>; Giacomo Caraccioli (d. 1357); Simon Baringuedus (d. after 1373); Johann Klenkok (Klenke) (d. 1374), author of the "Decadicon", an attack upon the "Sachsenspiegel"; Johannes Zachariae (d. 1428), known for his controversy with <a href="07584b.htm">John Hus</a> at the <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> and for his "Oratio de necessitate reformationis"; Paulus (Nicolettus) de Venetiis (d. 1429); Giovanni Dati (d. 1471); Ambrose of Cora (Corianus, Coriolanus) (d. 1485), general of the order after 1476; Thomas Pencket (d. 1487); <a href="01171a.htm">Aegidius of Viterbo</a> (d. 1532); Cosmas Damian Hortulanus (Hortola) (d. 1568); Caspar Casal (d. 1587), <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>; Pedro <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> (d. 1595); Giovanni Battista Arrighi (d. 1607); <a href="04386a.htm">Gregorio Nu&ntilde;ez Coronel</a> (d. 1620); Aegidius a Praesentatione Fonseca (d. 1626); Luigi Alberti (d. 1628); Basilius Pontius (d. 1629); Ludovicus Angelicus Aprosius (d. 1681); Nikolaus Gircken (d. 1717). Giovanni Michele Cavalieri (d. 1757) was a rubricist of note. <a href="13100b.htm">Father Angelo Rocca</a>, <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="13322a.htm">sacristan</a> and <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14553b.htm">Tagaste</a> (d. 1620), known for his liturgical and archaeological researches, was the founder of the Angelica Library (Bibliotheca Angelica), which was called after him and is now the public <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of the Augustinians in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Many Augustinians have written ascetic works and sermons. In the department of historical research the following are worthy of mention: <a href="11450a.htm">Onofrio Panvini</a> (d. 1568); <a href="03004b.htm">Joachim Brulius</a> (d. after 1652), who wrote a history of the colonization and <a href="03712a.htm">Christianizing</a> of <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a> (Antwerp, 1615), also a history of <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>; Enrique Florez (d. 1773), called "the first historian of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>", author of "Espana Sagrada"; and, lastly, Manuel Risco (d. 1801), author of a history of printing in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>.</p>

<p>To the missionaries of the order we owe many valuable contributions in linguistics. Father Melchor de Vargas composed, in 1576, a cathechism in the Mexican Otomi language; Father Diego Basalenque (d. 1651) and Miguel de Guevara compiled works in the languages of the savage Matlaltzinkas of Mexico; Father Manuel Perez translated the Roman Cathechism into <a href="02169b.htm">Aztec</a> in 1723. Others have made researches in the languages of the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, such as Father Diego Bergano and, in more recent times, Jos&eacute; Sequi (d. 1844), a prominent missionary of the order, who <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> 30,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. Many wrote grammars and compiled dictionaries. Father Herrera wrote a poetical life of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the Tagalog language in 1639. Fathers Martin de Hereda and Hieronymus penetrated into the interior of <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> in 1577, to study Chinese literature with the intention of bringing it into <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Father Antonius Aug. Georgius (d. 1797) composed the "Alphabetum Tibetanum" for the use of missionaries. Father Agostino Ciasca (d. 1902), titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09004b.htm">Larissa</a> and <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, a prominent member of the order in recent times, established a special faculty for Oriental languages at the Roman Seminary, published an Arabic translation of <a href="14464b.htm">Tatian's</a> "Diatessaron" and wrote "Bibliorum Fragmenta Copto-Sahidica". Father Dionysius of <a href="02686b.htm">Borgo San Sepolcro</a> (d. 1342), <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10497a.htm">Monopoli</a> in Lower <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, is the author of a commentary on the "Factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri IX" of Valerius Maximus, and was also much esteemed for his talents as poet, <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and orator. The missionaries of the order have also given us valuable descriptive works on foreign countries and peoples. In this class of writing Cipriano Navarro's important work on "The Inhabitants of the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a>" and a monumental work in six volumes entitled "La Flora de Filipinas" (Madrid, 1877--), are valuable contributions to literature and learning. Manuel Blanco, Ignacio Mercado, Antonio Llanos, Andr&eacute;s Naves, and Celestino Fernandez are also worthy of mention. Fathers Angelo Perez and Cecilio Guemes published in 1905 a work in four volumes entitled "La Imprentade Manila".</p>

<p>A number of mathematicians, astronomers, and musicians are also found among the members of the order, but it was the great scientist <a href="10180b.htm">Johann Gregor Mendel</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Thomas at Alt-Brunn in Moravia (d. 1884) who shed glory on the Augustinian Order in recent times. He was the discoverer of the Mendelian <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of heredity and hybridization (<em>see under</em> <a href="05655a.htm">EVOLUTION</a>; <em>and</em> <a href="10180b.htm">GREGOR MENDEL</a>). The value set upon learning and <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> by the Augustinian <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> is <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by the care given to their <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a> and by the establishment of their own printing-press in their <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, in 1479, as well as by the numerous learned men produced by the order and still contributing valuable additions to <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Father Tom&aacute;s C&aacute;maro y Castro (d. 1904), <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Salamanca, founded a scientific periodical, "La Ciudad de Dios", formerly entitled "Revista Agustiniana", and published by the Augustinians at <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a> since 1881. In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> the order possesses besides several meteorological stations, the observatory of the <a href="05534c.htm">Escorial</a>. Among the Augustinian writers of the present time should be mentioned: Zacar&iacute;as Mart&iacute;nez Nu&ntilde;ez, a celebrated Spanish orator and master of natural <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>; Honorato del Val, author of a great work on <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>; Aurelio Palmieri, one of the best authorities on the Russian language, literature, and <a href="07365a.htm">church history</a>.</p>

<p>The Augustinian Order has devoted itself from its beginning, with great <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> to the <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>. Only those engaged in teaching and inmates of the houses of recollection, among the Discalced, are exempt from the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to this <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, to follow which the order, though retaining its name <em>Hermits</em>, exchanged the contemplative life for the active. Seeing the good done by the <a href="06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, they wished to share in the harvest, undertaking to preach and instruct the people. Augustinians became the confessors and advisers of <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, princes, and rulers. Many became <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, several <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, exercising these offices for the good of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of their order. At present the order has a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, Sebastiano Martinelli (formerly <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> for the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>), several <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>--Guglielmo Pifferi (see above); Stephen Reville, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13436a.htm">Sandhurst</a> in Australia; Arsenio Campo y Monasterio, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11148a.htm">Nueva C&aacute;ceres</a> in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>; Giovanni Camilleri, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06687b.htm">Gozzo</a>; Jos&eacute; L&oacute;pez de Mendoza y Garcia, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11437a.htm">Pampeluna</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>; Giuseppe Capecci, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01283d.htm">Alessandria</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; Francisco Xavier Vald&eacute;s y Noriega, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Salamanca; William A. Jones, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a>; the Vicars Luis Perez of Northern Hu-nan (China) and Dominic Murray, Cooktown, Australia; the <a href="12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> (Paulino D&iacute;az Alonso) of San Le&oacute;n de Amazonas--and, finally, two mitred <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>.</p>

<p>The order has produced many <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, for example, Sts. <a href="11065a.htm">Nicholas of Tolentino</a> (d. 1305), John of Sahag&uacute;n (a Sancto Facundo) (d. 1479), and <a href="14696a.htm">Thomas of Villanova</a> (d. 1555). Stefano Bellesini (d. 1840), the Augustinian <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Genazzano, in the Roman province, was <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 27 December, 1904. The process for the <a href="02364b.htm">beatification</a> of seven Augustinians, among them the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="13322a.htm">sacristan</a> Bartolommeo Menochio (d. 1827), is under consideration.</p>

<p>As to the devotional practices specially connected with the Augustinian Order, and which it has striven to propagate, we may mention the veneration of the Blessed Virgin under the title of "Mother of Good Counsel", whose <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> picture is to be seen in the Augustinian church at Genazzano in the Roman province. This devotion has spread to other churches and countries, and confraternities have been formed to cultivate it. Several periodicals dedicated to the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of Our Lady of Good Counsel are published in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by the Augustinians (cf. Meschler on the history of the <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> picture of Genazzano in "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach", LXVII, 482 sqq.). Besides this devotion the order fosters the Archconfraternity of Our Lady of Consolation, a so-called girdle confraternity, the members of which wear a blessed girdle of black leather in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of Sts. <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="10482a.htm">Monica</a>, and <a href="11065a.htm">Nicholas of Tolentino</a>, recite daily thirteen <a href="09356a.htm">Our Fathers</a> and <a href="07110b.htm">Hail Marys</a> and the <a href="13409a.htm">Salve Regina</a>, fast strictly on the eve of the feast of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, and receive <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> on the feasts of the three above-named <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. This confraternity was founded by <a href="05601a.htm">Pope Eugene IV</a> at S. Giacomo, Bologna, in 1439, made an archconfraternity by <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, in 1575, aggregated to the Augustinian Order, and favoured with <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. The Augustinians, with the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, also encourage the devotion of the <a href="13508b.htm">Scapular</a> of Our Lady of Good Counsel and the propagation of the <a href="14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of <a href="07281a.htm">St. Augustine</a> for the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, as well as the veneration of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and his mother St. Monica, in order to instill the Augustinian spirit of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and self-sacrifice into their parishioners.</p>

<p>The Augustinians hold an honourable place in the history of foreign missions. Before the middle of the fourteenth century, Father Nikolaus Teschel (d. 1371), auxiliary <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, where he died, with some brethren preached the Gospel in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>. In 1533, after the subjugation of Mexico by <a href="04397a.htm">Cortez</a>, some Augustinians, sent by <a href="14696a.htm">St. Thomas of Villanova</a>, accomplished great missionary work in that country. Monasteries sprang up in the principal places and became the centers of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, art, and civilization. The Patio (Cloister) of the former <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, now the post office, at <a href="12601b.htm">Quer&eacute;taro</a>, is one of the most beautiful examples of stone-carving in America. The Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Mexico are today either deserted or occupied by a few fathers only; some even only by one. The Provincia Michoacanensis (see above, Present Condition) at present has about 55 members, while the Provincia Mexicana has 31, most of whom are <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. Augustinian missionaries extended their labours to South America (Colombia, <a href="15327a.htm">Venezuela</a>, <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>) with great success. Political events in these countries prevented the order from prospering and hindered the success of its undertakings, so that in course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> became deserted. Late events in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, however, have permitted the Augustinians to return to their former churches and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and even to found new ones.</p>

<p>In the <a href="04121b.htm">Republic of Colombia</a>, 26 members of the Philippine province are employed, including 6 at the residence of <a href="13457a.htm">Santa Fe</a> de Bogota, 8 in the college at Facatativa, and 12 at other stations. In <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a> 49 members of the same province are employed: 14 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and 2 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> belonging to the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="09255a.htm">Lima</a>; 12 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to the college in the same city; 6 in each of the two <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> at <a href="04580c.htm">Cuzco</a> and <a href="02164a.htm">Ayacucho</a>. In the Prefecture Apostolic of San Le&oacute;n de Amazonas, at the mission stations of Peba, R&iacute;o Tigre, and Leticia in the territory of the Iquito Indians there are 9 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. In June, 1904, Father Bernardo Calle, the <a href="09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, Miguel Vilajoli, and more than 70 <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, were <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> at the recently erected mission station, Huabico, in Upper Maranon and the station itself was destroyed. The Augustinian settlements in <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a> also belong to the Philippine province. In the procuration house at S. Paulo (Rua Apeninos 6) and in the college at Brotas there are 4 Augustinians each; in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at S. Jos&eacute; de Manaos, 6; and in the other settlements, 27 priests--in all, 42 members of the order, including one <a href="09093a.htm">lay brother</a>. In <a href="01702d.htm">Argentina</a>, there are 25 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and two <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> in the six colleges and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of the order. In <a href="05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, which forms a province by itself, there are 21 members of the order; 9 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and 7 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a>; 3 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at Latagun and 2 in that at <a href="07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>. The province of <a href="03660a.htm">Chile</a> has 56 members, including 18 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; 11 at <a href="13460a.htm">Santiago</a>, 4 at <a href="13726e.htm">La Serena</a>, 5 at <a href="04190b.htm">Concepci&oacute;n</a>, 22 at Talca, 8 at San Fernando, 4 at Melipilla, and 2 in the residence at Picazo. The province of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States of America</a> is very large, as the Augustinians driven out of many <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> countries in 1848 sought refuge in that republic. This province now numbers 200 members. The largest <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> is at Villanova, Pa.; it is also the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for North America, and among the 117 religious occupying the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> 21 are <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> (see above, Present Condition). The other <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> contain 60 members, of whom 5 are <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. To the province of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> belongs also St. Augustine's College at <a href="07153b.htm">Havana</a>, <a href="04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, where there are 5 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and 3 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>.</p>

<p>The greatest missionary activity of the Augustinian Order has been displayed in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, and the first missionaries to visit these islands were Augustinians. When Magalhaes discovered the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a> (16 March, 1521) and took possession of them in the name of the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he was accompanied by the <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the fleet, who preached the Gospel to the inhabitants, <a href="02258b.htm">baptizing</a> Kings Colambu and Siagu and 800 natives of Mindanao and Ceb&uacute;, on <a href="09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a>, 7 April, 1521. The good seed, however, was soon almost destroyed; Magalhaes was killed in a fight with natives on the little island of Mactan on 27 April and the seed sown by the first Spanish missionaries all but perished; nor were those missionaries brought from Mexico in 1543 by Ruy L&oacute;pez Villalobos more successful, for they were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> by way of <a href="06602a.htm">Goa</a>, having gained very little hold on the islanders. Under the Adelantado Legaspi who in 1565 established the sovereignty of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a> and selected Manila as the capital in 1571, <a href="15223a.htm">Father Andr&eacute;s de Urdaneta</a> and 4 other Augustinians landed at <a href="03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a> in 1565, and at once began a very successful apostolate. The first houses of the Augustinians were established at <a href="03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>, in 1565, and at <a href="09597b.htm">Manila</a>, in 1571. In 1575, under the leadership of Father Alfonso Gutierez, twenty-four Spanish Augustinians landed in the islands and, with the <a href="12514b.htm">provincials</a> Diego de Herrera and Martin de Rado, worked very successfully, at first as wandering preachers. The <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> first appeared in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a> in 1577 and were warmly welcomed by the Augustinians. Soon they were joined by <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Sent by Philip III, the first Barefooted Augustinians landed in 1606. All these orders shared in the labours and difficulties of the missions. Protected by <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, they prospered, and their missionary efforts became more and more successful. In 1773 the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, however, were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give up their missions in consequence of the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders have suffered much <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a> in recent times, especially the Augustinians. In 1897 the Calced Augustinians, numbering 319 out of 644 religious then in the Philippine province, had charge of 225 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 2,377,743 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; the Discalced (Recollects), numbering about 220, with 233 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 1,175,156 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; the Augustinians of the Philippine province numbered in all 522, counting those in the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> at <a href="09597b.htm">Manila</a>, Cavite, San Sebastian, and Ceb&uacute;, those at the large model farm at Imus, and those in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> at the colleges of Monteagudo, Marcilla, and San Millan de la Cogulla. Besides the numerous <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> served by the Calced Augustinians, they possessed several <a href="13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>: a superior and intermediate <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Vigan (Villa Fernandina) with 209 students, an <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a> and trade <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Tambohn near <a href="09597b.htm">Manila</a>, with 145 <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a>, etc. In consequence of the disturbances, the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and missions were deserted; six fathers were killed and about 200 <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and sometimes harshly treated. Those who escaped unmolested fled to the principal house at <a href="09597b.htm">Manila</a>, to <a href="09481b.htm">Macao</a>, to Han-kou, to South America, or to Mexico. Up to the beginning of 1900, 46 Calced and 120 Discalced Augustinians had been <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. Upon their release, they returned to the few <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> still left them in the islands or set out for <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="04121b.htm">Colombia</a>, <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>, <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, <a href="01702d.htm">Argentina</a> and <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>. The province of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> sent some members to supply the vacancies in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Paul, at <a href="09597b.htm">Manila</a>, now has 24 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and 6 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; that at <a href="03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>, 5 members of the order, that at Iloilo, on the island of Panay, 11 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and 2 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, while in the 10 residences there are 20 fathers; so that at the present time there are only 68 Calced Augustinians in the islands. In all, the Provincia Ss. Nominis Jesu Insularum Philippinarum, including <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students and the comparatively small number of <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, has 600 members: 359 in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 185 of whom are priests; 68 in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a>; 29 in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>; 26 in Colombia; 49 in <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>; 42 in <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>; 27 in <a href="01702d.htm">Argentina</a>.</p>

<p>The Augustinian missions in the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a> have provided missionaries for the East since their first establishment. In 1603 some of them penetrated into <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a>, where several were <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a>, and in 1653 others entered <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, where, in 1701, the order had six missionary stations. At present the order possesses the mission of Northern Hu-nan, <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, where there are 24 members, 2 of whom are natives; 6 in the district of Yo-chou; 6 in the district of Ch'ang-te; 9 in the district of Li-chu; three other religious are also labouring in other districts-all under the <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Mgr. Perez. The mission comprises about 3000 <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and 3500 <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> in a population of 11 millions of <a href="11388a.htm">heathens</a>. In 1891 there were only 219 <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and 11 <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, as well as 29 <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 420 children and 750 <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a>. There are, moreover, two <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> at the mission house at Han-kou and two at the procuration house at Shang-hai (Yang-tsze-poo Road, 10). The missionary history of <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a> also mentions the Augustinians. Towards the close of the sixteenth century, Alexio de Menezes, Count of Cantanheda (d. 1617), a member of the order, appointed <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="06602a.htm">Goa</a> in 1595, and of <a href="02728a.htm">Braga</a> in 1612, <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the East Indies, and several times Viceroy of <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>, sent several Augustinians as missionaries to <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a> while he himself laboured for the reunion of the <a href="14678a.htm">Thomas Christians</a>, especially at the Synod of Diamper, in 1599, and for the conversion of the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> and the <a href="11388a.htm">heathens</a> of Malabar. (Govea, "Jornada do Arcebispo de Goa Dom Alexio de Menezes", <a href="04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, 1606; also, "Histoire Orient. de grans progres de l'&eacute;glise Romaine en la reduction des anciens chrestiens dit de St. Thomas" translated from the Spanish of Franc. Munoz by J.B. de Glen, <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 1609; Joa. a S. Facundo Raulin, "Historia ecclesiae malabaricae", Rome, 1745.)</p>

<p>The Augustinians also established missions in Oceanica and Australia. Here the Spanish Discalced Augustinians took over the missions founded by Spanish and German <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the Ladrones, which now number 7 stations, with about 10,000 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, on Guam and about 2500 on each of the German islands of Saipan, Rota, and Tinian. The mission on the German islands was separated from the <a href="03471a.htm">Diocese of Ceb&uacute;</a> on 1 October, 1906, and made a <a href="12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a> on 18 June, 1907, with Saipan as its seat of administration, and the mission is now in charge of the German <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. In Australia the Calced Augustinians are established in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of <a href="10155a.htm">Melbourne</a> and in the Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown, Queensland, where there are at present twelve <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> province under Monsignor James D. Murray. Three <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, each with two <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, in other parts of <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a> also belong to this province. The order has furnished some prominent <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a>, among them, James Alipius Gould. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Augustinian college of St. Patrick at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, built in 1884 by Father Patrick Glynn, O.S.A., is the training college for the Augustinian missions. The present <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> is Reginald Maurice McGrath.</p>

<h2>Augustinian Nuns</h2>

<p>These regard as their first foundation the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> for which <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> wrote the rules of life in his Epistola ccxi (alias cix) in 423. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that this epistle was called the <a href="02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> for <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, and has been followed as the rule of life in many <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> since the eleventh century. These <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were not consolidated in 1256, like the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of Augustinian <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. Each <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was independent and was not subject to the general of the order. This led to differences in rule, dress, and mode of life. Only since the fifteenth century have certain Augustinian Hermits reformed a number of Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">nunneries</a>, become their spiritual directors, and induced them to adopt the Constitution of their order. Henceforth, therefore, we meet with <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> members of the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and later in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where, however, many were suppressed during the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, or by the secularizing law of 1803. In the other countries many <a href="04340c.htm">nunneries</a> were closed in consequence of the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. The still existing houses, except Cascia, Renteria (Diocese of Vittoria), Eibar (Diocese of Vittoria), and Cracow, are now under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Many <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> are celebrated for the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> whom they produced, such as Montefalco in Central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the home of Blessed Clara of the Cross (Clara of Montefalco, d. 1308), and Cascia, near <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, where <a href="13164a.htm">St. Rita</a> died in 1457. In the suppressed <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Agnetenberg near Dulmen, in <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, lived <a href="05406b.htm">Anne Catherine Emmerich</a> celebrated for her visions.</p>

<p>Mention should also be made of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Augustinians called delle Vergini, at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, founded in 1177 by <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> after his reconciliation with <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, whose daughter Julia, with twelve girls of noble birth, entered the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and became first <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>. Doge Sebastiano Zani, who had endowed the institution, was appointed patron, with the privilege of approving the election of the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> before the granting of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation. On the French occupation in the eighteenth century the religious went to America, where they devoted themselves to the work of teaching and the care of the sick. Later they established <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and in 1817 in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Towards the end of the sixteenth century communities of <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> Discalced Augustinians appeared in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The first <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, that of the Visitation, was founded at <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, in 1589, by Prudencia Grillo, a lady of noble birth, and received its Constitution from Father Alfonso of Orozco. Juan de Ribera, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15251b.htm">Valencia</a> (d. 1611), founded a second Discalced Augustinian congregation at Alcoy, in 1597. It soon had houses in different parts of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and in 1663 was established at <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> by Queen Louise of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. In addition to the <a href="02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> these religious observed the exercises of the Reformed <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> of <a href="14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a>. In the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at Cybar, Mariana Manzanedo of St. Joseph instituted a reform which led to the establishment of a third, that of the <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> Augustinian Recollects. The <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>, drawn up by Father Antin&oacute;lez, and later confirmed by <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, bound the sisters to the strictest interpretation of the rules of poverty and obedience, and a rigorous penitential discipline. All three reforms spread in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, but not in other countries. A congregation of Augustinian <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> under the title "Sisters of St. Ignatius" was introduced into the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a> and South America by the Discalced Augustinian Hermits. They worked <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> in aid of the missions, <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a> in the island, and founded the colleges of Our Lady of Consolation and of St. Anne at <a href="09597b.htm">Manila</a>, and houses at Neuva Segovia, <a href="03471a.htm">Ceb&uacute;</a>, and Mandaloya on the Pasig, where they have done much for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of girls.</p>
