<p>Founded by St. Gilbert, about the year 1130, at Sempringham, Gilbert's native place, where he was then <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. His wish originally had been to found a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but finding this impossible, he gave a rule of life to the seven young <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> whom as children he had taught at Sempringham, and built for them a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> and <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> to the north of his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church. He received the support of his <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Alexander of Lincoln, and in a year's time the seven virgins of Sempringham made their profession. Gilbert seems to have been determined to copy the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> as much as possible. At the suggestion of William, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Rievaulx, he instituted lay sisters to attend to the daily wants of the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and soon added a company of <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> to do the rougher work in the farms and fields. These he recruited from among the poorest serfs of his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> and estates. For eight years the little community at Sempringham continued to flourish, and it was not till about 1139 that the infant order was increased by another foundation. Alexander of Lincoln gave to the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Sempringham the island of Haverholm, near Sleaford, in Lincolnshire, the site of one of his castles destroyed in the contest between King Stephen and his barons. Alexander's deed of gift makes it clear that the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> had by this time adopted the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> rule "as far as the weakness of their sex allowed". The fame of Sempringham soon spread far and wide through that part of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> sent out several colonies to people new foundations. In 1148 Gilbert travelled to <a href="03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> in burgundy to ask the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> there assembled in chapter to take charge of his order. This they refused to do, declining to undertake the government of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, and so Gilbert returned to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, determined to add to each of his <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> a community of canons regular, who were to act as <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and spiritual directors to the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. To these he gave the <a href="02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. Each Gilbertine house now practically consisted of four communities, one of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, one of canons, one of lay sisters, and one of <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. The popularity of the order was considerable, and for two years after Gilbert's return from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> he was continually founding new houses on lands granted him by the nobles and <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>. These houses, with the exception of Watton and Malton, which were in Yorkshire, were situated in Lincolnshire, in the low-lying country of the fens. Thirteen houses were founded in St. Gilbert's life, four of which were for men only.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The habit of the Gilbertine canons consisted of a black tunic reaching to the ankles, covered with a white cloak and hood, which were lined with lamb's wool. The <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> were in white, and during the winter months were allowed to wear in choir a tippet of sheepskin and a black cap lined with white wool. The <a href="13508b.htm">scapular</a> was worn both by the canons and the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The whole order was ruled by the "master", or prior general, who was not Prior of Sempringham, but was called "Prior of All". His authority was absolute, and the year formed for him a continual round of visitations to the various houses. He appointed to the chief offices, received the profession of <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>, affixed his seal to all charters, etc. and gave or withheld his consent regarding sales, transfers, and the like. He was to be chosen by the general chapter, which could depose him if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. This general chapter assembled once a year, at Sempringham, on the rogation days, and was attended by the prior, cellarer, and <a href="12428a.htm">prioress</a> of each house.</p>

<p>St. Gilbert, soon finding the work of visitations too arduous, <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> that certain canons and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> should assist him. These also appeared at the general chapter. A "priest of confession" was chosen to visit each house and to act as confessor extraordinary. A Gilbertine <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> had only one church: this was divided unevenly by a wall, the main part of the building being for the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, the lesser part, to the south, for the canons. These had access to the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns'</a> part only for the celebration of Mass. The <a href="04340c.htm">nunnery</a> lay to the north, the dwellings of the canons were usually to the south. At Sempingham itself, and at Watton, we find them at some distance to the north-east. The number of canons to be attached to each <a href="04340c.htm">nunnery</a> was fixed by St. Gilbert at seven. The chief difficulty Gilbert experienced was the government of the <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. They were mostly rough and untamed spirits who needed the control and guidance of a firm man, and it would have been surprising had there been no cases of insubordination and <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> among them. Two instances especially claim our attention. The first is related by <a href="01172b.htm">St. &AElig;lred</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Rievaulx, and gives us an unpleasant story of a girl at Watton Priory who had been sent there to be brought up by the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>; the second was an open revolt, for a time successful, of some of the <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> at Sempringham.</p>

<p>From their foundation till the dissolution of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the Crown showed great favour to the Gilbertines. They were the only purely English order and owed allegiance to no foreign superiors as did the Cluniacs and <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. All the Gilbertine houses were situated in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, except two which were in Westmeath, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Notwithstanding the liberal charters granted by Henry II and his successors, the order had fallen into great poverty by the end of the fifteenth century. Henry VI exempted all its houses from payments of every kind &mdash; an exemption which could not and did not bind his successors. Heavy sums had occasionally to be paid to the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, and expenses were incurred in suits against the real or pretended encroachments of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. By the time of the Dissolution there were twenty-six houses. They fared no better than the other <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and no resistance whatever was made by the last Master of Sempringham, Robert Holgate, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, a great favourite at court, who was promoted in 1545 to the Archbishopric of York. The Gilbertines are described as surrendering "of their own free will", each of the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and canons receiving "a reasonable yearly pension". Only four of their houses were ranked among the greater <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> as having an income above &pound;200 a year, and as the order appears to have preserved to the end the plainness and simplicity in church plate and vestments enjoined by St. Gilbert, the Crown did not reap a rich harvest by its suppression.</p>
