<p>The group of Maltese islands, including Malta (91.5 sq. m.), Gozo (24 3/4 sq. m.), Comine (1 sq. m.) and a few inconsiderable islets, lies 58 miles south of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and about 180 miles S.E. by E. of Cape Bon in Tunisia. Malta is the headquarters of the British Mediterranean fleet, and the principal coaling station in the Mediterranean. Owing to the prosperity consequent upon its important position, the island is able to support a population out of all proportion to its size. The estimated civil population of the islands was 205, 059 on 1 April, 1906. If about 18,000 be added for the garrison and the Royal Navy, we reach a total of over 223,000. Without reckoning the fluctuating population of the harbours, the density of the population in Malta itself works out at over 2000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> per sq. mile. Of the civil population over 99% are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1901 there were in the civil population 696 lunatics, 418 blind, 80 <a href="09182a.htm">lepers</a>, 211 lawyers, and 190 <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>. In the same year the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> consisted of 698 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and 251 <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>; the <a href="12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of 249 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 151 <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 140 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. There were 470 religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> including <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a> and lay-sisters. In Malta and Gozo there are 27 <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men and 36 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> and institutes of religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. There are about 190 <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, in which some 20,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> are being <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a>. Besides the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> (about 120 students), the Lyceum (400), and 79 government elementary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, there are 53 other government <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> (312), 22 <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> under religious direction, the rest under the direction of private <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>. The overflow of the population is mainly to other Mediterranean ports. In 1901, 33,948 Maltese returned as residing in countries bordering on the Mediterranean. Of these, 15,208 were in <a href="15088a.htm">Tunis</a> and 6984 in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The government consists of an Executive Council of eleven members besides the governor, who is usually a distinguished general, and of a Legislative Council consisting of ten official and eight elected members. All the judges and most of the other government officials are Maltese. Italian and English are the languages of the <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in Malta. Both are taught in every <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> but only a small percentage of the population speak either fluently. The revenue for the year 1903-04 was &#163;464,590, of which &#163;274,251 came from the customs. Under this latter head the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> on imported grain amounted to &#163;97,210. In 1879 proposals were made to reduce the grain <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, which weighs heavily on the poorer classes. Strangely enough, both the people and their representatives stoutly opposed the reduction. There is no direct taxation in Malta and strictly speaking no public <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>. The higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> at the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> is paid for by public tax. In 1902-3 the total expenditure under this head was &#163;3950, of which &#163;3674 was paid out of the treasury. In 1904, 38748 acres, i.e. 60.5 sq. miles, were under cultivation in the Maltese islands. Of these 6546 belonged to Government, 6682 to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> institutions, and 25,520 to private <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Wheat and barley, potatoes, cotton, and grapes form the chief produce of the land. The Maltese honey, from the superior quality of which the island was supposed to derive its name of Melita (i.e. Greek <em>meli</em>, gen. <em>melitos</em> = honey), now lives mostly on its reputation. Agriculture in Malta has been starved by trade. A peculiarly national industry is the Maltese lace, chiefly made in <a href="06687b.htm">Gozo</a>.</p>

<h2>Civil history</h2>

<p>There can be no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that, at a very early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, Malta was colonized by the <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a>. Numerous megalithic and other remains, as well as inscriptions, testify to this fact. It is even probable that the <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a> gave the island its name, which seems to be derived from the verb "malat", "to take refuge" and to mean, therefore, "the place of refuge". It is often asserted that Malta, during the eighth century B.C., passed into the possession of the Greeks and was held by them for three centuries, but there is little evidence to support this view. It is clear, however, that the Carthaginians became masters of the island, probably in the fifth century B.C., at a time when the weaker <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> states united, for mutual protection, under the leadership of Carthage. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a>, too, that Malta, about the time of the Second Punic <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, though the precise date of its capture cannot be fixed (cf. Livy, xxi, 51), became a Roman possession and, after the destruction of the Roman power in the West, remained subject to the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> until 870. In that year the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> established themselves in the island where, it appears, they were, as in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and elsewhere, welcomed as deliverers from the <a href="07149b.htm">hated</a> Byzantine yoke.</p>

<p>The principal and almost the only monument of the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> dominion is said to be the Maltese language, which is <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a> and has much in common with Arabic. The weight of the best authority seems, however, to incline decidedly to the view that the present Maltese language is directly descended from the <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> with but little modification by the Arabic. The <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, in fact, seem to have left the Maltese very much to themselves and to have interfered with their language as little as they interfered with their religion and their popular customs. The account of the capture of Malta by the Normans, as given by Mataterra, the secretary of Count Roger, does not, certainly, convey the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> were sufficiently numerous to offer any serious resistance to the invaders. If the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> influence had prevailed so far as to make a complete change in the language of the islanders, this could only have been the sequel to a process of denationalization which had no counterpart in the neighbouring island of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and which would have implied the presence of a strong army of occupation. History and philology alike point to the conclusion that the Maltese, in spite of powerful outside influences, are still substantially, a <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> people. Count Roger of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, who landed in Malta in 1090, was welcomed, it seems, not as a deliverer from an oppressive yoke, but because the islanders naturally preferred a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> to a <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> rule. The Norman domination established by him lasted about a century. It was probably during this period that the absence of a national literature, the need of employing foreign notaries, and other causes, forced the Maltese to adopt <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> as their written language. Later on, when the more fully developed Italian asserted itself in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> it naturally became the medium of legal and commercial transactions in Malta. Its influence on the spoken language was confined to the vocabulary, which contains a number of Italian words, the structure remaining unaltered. At least conjointly with Latin and other languages, Italian has remained the literary language of the island right down to our own times.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1199 Malta, along with <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, passed into the hands of the Swabian emperors, but, after the battle of <a href="02477b.htm">Beneventum</a> (1266) in which Charles of Anjou put an end to the Swabian rule in Apulia and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, it remained for seventeen years in the possession of the French. In 1283, the year after the <a href="15384a.htm">"Sicilian Vespers"</a>, the island, which had fared badly under the Swabians and worse still under the French, once more changed masters and became the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of King Peter III of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. Under the Spanish rule, which lasted two centuries and a half, Malta made considerable progress in civilization. This was very largely owing to the influence of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, especially the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and Augustinians, but partly also to the influx of foreign beneficiaries who, if they lived on the wealth of the land, made some return in the higher culture which they helped to diffuse. Early in 1523, the Knights of St. John, after the fall of <a href="13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>, left that island with the honours of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, and being unable, for nearly seven years, to find a lodgment that was convenient to all parties concerned, they were at length established in Malta, which was conferred upon them by the <a href="03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> in the year 1530. The earlier period of their rule was the golden age of the history of the island, for during that time Malta was one of the chief bulwarks of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> against the power of the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The successful defence of the island by the Grand Master La Vallette, in 1565, ranks as high as the Battle of <a href="09181b.htm">Lepanto</a> among the feats of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="03691a.htm">chivalry</a>. The invaders, numbering over 40,000 men, must have considerably outnumbered the total population of the island which contained but 8500 men bearing arms, including the 592 members of the order. Yet such was the spirit which the <a href="06147a.htm">brave</a> islanders imbibed from their leaders that they compelled the enemy to retire, with heavy loss, after a siege of nearly four months.</p>

<p>The decline of the Ottoman power meant the decay of the Order of St. John. By the end of the eighteenth century, so rife was the spirit of the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, so powerful the clique of traitors among the Knights, and so great the disaffection of the people, that, when <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> appeared before Malta in June, 1798, he found that there was little left for him to do but to take quiet possession of the island. After a few days' sojourn, during which he drew up a new scheme of government and made French the national language, he departed on his fatal expedition to <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, carrying with him a great part of the loot which, to the value of &pound;250,000, had been taken from the churches and palaces of Malta. Shortly after his departure the French garrison, cut off by Nelson's fleet from all chance of reinforcements, was shut up in Valetta by the Maltese who were aided, at the last, by English and <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> troops, and was compelled to surrender in September, 1800, after a siege of two years. Immediately after this event the Maltese, who had no reason for desiring the return of the Knights and still less of falling into the power of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> or <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, offered to place the island under the protection of the British flag. The offer was accepted on the distinct understanding that their religion and institutions should be respected. The British sovereignty was confirmed at the treaty of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1814). The population of Malta and Gozo was over 25,000 in 1535; over 40,000 in 1621; 54,463 in 1632, and 114,000 in 1798. Since this last date it has nearly doubled.</p>

<h2>Ecclesiastical history</h2>

<p>The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in Malta was founded by <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and St. Publius, whose name is mentioned in the Acts, was its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. After ruling the Maltese Church for thirty-one years he was, we are told, transferred in A.D. 90 to the <a href="02046a.htm">See of Athens</a>, where he was <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 125. Though a complete list of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the days of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> to Constantine has been made out, its authenticity is more than <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. Still there seems no reason to suppose that, during the early days of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the flock was long without a shepherd. In 451 there was an Acacius, Melitenus Episcopus, whose name is subscribed to the Acts of the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. In 501 Constantinus, Episcopus Melitenensis, was present at the Fifth General Council. In 588 Tucillus, Miletinae civitatis episcopus, was deposed by <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, and his successor <a href="15015a.htm">Trajan</a> elected by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of Malta in 599. The last <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> before the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracen</a> conquest was the Greek Manas. After the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> in 868, he was unable to return to his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, which was being invaded by the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, and not long after we find him in chains in a <a href="10424a.htm">Saracen</a> <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> at Palermo. Of successors of his under the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> there are no records, though probably such were appointed. Hence, if probable breaks in the episcopate be no bar to their claim, the Maltese can boast of belonging to the only extant <a href="07424b.htm">Apostolic see</a>, with the single exception of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Except under Charles of Anjou, who caused Maltese <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> to be appointed, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Malta was commonly a <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a>. There was one Maltese <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> under the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, one Maltese and one half Maltese under the Knights. Since 1808 all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been natives of the island. No Maltese was allowed to become a <a href="03691a.htm">knight</a> of St. John. This arrangement was made with the purpose, among others, of preventing the existence, within the order, of a faction supported by the native population. Ecclesiastical grades, however, were open to natives, and we find the names of three Maltese who were grand <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a> of the order.</p>

<p>The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in Malta have always been the natural leaders of the people. It was a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, Gaetano Mannarino, who headed an abortive revolt against the government of the Knights in 1775. In 1788 Canon F. X. Caruana acquired a more enviable reputation by accepting the leadership of the people in their insurrection against the French invaders. It was he too who demanded the annexation of Malta to Great Britain. He became <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1831. Since 1864 the island of <a href="06687b.htm">Gozo</a> has had its own <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Hence, with their two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and nearly a thousand <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Maltese islands are more plentifully provided with <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> than any other country in the world. The place occupied by religion in the life of the people is betokened not only by the large number of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and of religious men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, but also by the frequent festas and processions which stay the traffic of the streets, by the constant ringing of bells, and by the size and beauty of even the village churches. The church of the village of Musta boasts the third largest <a href="05100b.htm">dome</a> in the world. Canon law prevails in Malta as the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the land. Hence <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> are illegal unless performed by a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. The large number of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> in Malta is due, in some measure, to the smallness of the patrimony fixed as a condition for receiving the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> minimum is XX10. Equivalent to this is a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> of XX5 rental. In 1777 <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, in order to lessen the excessive number of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> in the island, raised the minimum patrimony from 45 Maltese ducats or scudi (abt. $19) to 80 (abt. $34).</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The earlier history of Malta has still to be written, and the materials for it may yet be found among the Sicilian and other archives. The Maltese writers ABELA (Malta Illustrata, 1647) and his successor CIANTAR (Malta Illustrata, 1780) have been, until lately, the commonly accepted authorities. More critical work has been done recently by CARUANA, Sull' Origine della Lingua Maltest (Malta, 1896). Other works are MIEGE, Histoire de Malte (Paris, 1841); VASSALLO, Storia di Malta (Malta, 1854); FERRIS, Storia Ecclesiastica di Malta (Malta, 1877); PANZAVECCHIA, Ultimo periodo della storia di Malta (Malta, 1835); PORTER, Knights of St. John; AZOPARDI, Giornale della Presa di Malta (Malta, 1836); RANSIJAT, Assedio et Blocco di Malta.</p></div>
