<p>Approbation is an act by which a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or other legitimate superior grants to an ecclesiastic the actual exercise of his ministry. The plenitude of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> power given by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> to His <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> resides solely in the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. From the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as the centre of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, depend the government and care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, namely, the dispensing of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The helpers with whose aid the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> exercises his pastoral ministry are the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, their vicars and co-workers. These possess the power by virtue of the episcopal delegation, transmitted by means of many acts differing one from the other. The permanent capability and the appointment to the service of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in general are transmitted by means of <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. The actual appointment to the exercise of ministry in a determined sphere springs from the conferring of an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office which, in accord with the spirit of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, is recognized as a permanent charge, and hence should not be given except after a special <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of fitness by him who is invested therewith. Even when a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, by <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> and appointment to a charge, is made capable of the pastoral ministry and is assigned to it, the exercise of the transmitted power still depends upon the will and faithfulness of the mandatory; and at the same time other extensive variable circumstances, v. g. the actual situation of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or the spirit of the times, may determine now an extension, now a restriction, and at times suspension or revocation of the delegated power. From this it follows that, besides orders and the appointment to a charge, a special act of delegation is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the actual exercise of the pastoral ministry. Hence the word approbation is appropriate to keep the co-workers of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> alert, to remind them of their dependence, to give the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> greater facility to exercise his right of watchfulness, and to keep each one within the proper limits of his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The absolute necessity of approbation, especially for administering the <a href="11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, was expressly decreed by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIII, XV, De ref.), so that, except in the case of imminent death, the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> by a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> not approved would be invalid. This approbation for the <a href="11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> is the judicial declaration of the legitimate superior that a certain <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is fit to hear, and has the faculties to hear, the confession of his subjects. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, quoted above, decrees: "Although <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> receive in their <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> the power of absolving from <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, nevertheless the Holy Synod ordains that no one, even though he be a regular, is able to hear the confessions of seculars, not even of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and that he is not to be reputed fit thereunto, unless he either holds a <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> or is, by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, after an examination if they shall think it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, or in some other way, judged fit and has obtained their approbation, which shall be granted gratuitously &mdash; any privileges and custom whatsoever, though immemorial, to the contrary notwithstanding." This is the basis of the actual discipline everywhere. Francisco Su&aacute;rez (De P&oelig;n., disp. xxviii, sect. 3, tract. xxi) says that before the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> by law could validly and lawfully give <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to any <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> who had the proper qualifications of the natural and <a href="09071a.htm">divine law</a> to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a>, without approbation or <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> withdrew this by its requirement of the approbation of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> has from his "parochial <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>" the implied approbation of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and ordinary power to hear the confessions of his own parishioners, even outside his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> or diocese.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>By <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is meant also his <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, or the <a href="15401c.htm">vicar-capitular</a> or administrator during the vacancy of a see, also any regular <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> having ordinary <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over a certain territory. This approbation may be given orally or in writing, and may be given indirectly, as when, for instance, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> receive power to choose in their own diocese an approved <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of another diocese for their confessor. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> may wrongfully but validly refuse his approbation, without which no <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> may hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a>. Approbation ceases at the time fixed, by revocation of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if attached to a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>; by the loss of the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>; also by censure, if inflicted publicly; if the censure is inflicted privately, the exercise of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is unlawful but valid. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> may grant this <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to those who have the essential requirements in any part of the world, and to whomsoever he thinks fit. A <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> may grant it likewise in his own diocese, and superiors of regulars to their subjects. By custom an approved <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> absolves validly in any part of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in which he is approved. An approved confessor may hear the confessions of those coming from another diocese who come in <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a>, and not <a href="06249a.htm">fraudulently</a> to escape the reservations of their own diocese. An approved confessor may absolve from the cases "reserved" in another diocese, but not from those reserved in his own diocese. A confessor's <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> may be restricted to various classes of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, e.g. to children, or to men, without the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to hear <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. A special approbation is required to hear <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> or <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, and this extends with modifications to all communities of recognized sisterhoods. A confessor approved for one <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> is not presumed to be approved for all. A confessor having temporary <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> for "reserved cases" may continue to exercise it in any case begun before the lapse of the appointed time. The <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> travelling on the high seas, if he be approved by his own ordinary, may validly hear the confessions of any of his companions during the whole journey, even if from time to time the vessel put into a port or ports outside the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of said ordinary (S. C. Inq., 4 April, 1900).</p>

<p>Approbation given in a general way does not cease at the death of the giver. Approbation may be made revocable, and restricted to a place, time, and <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, according to the judgment of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. By the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> quoted of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, regulars must obtain the approbation of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to hear the confessions of seculars, even of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. This special clause was inserted to put an end to controversies that had arisen from privileges granted to the regulars. In 1215 the <a href="09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> had decreed that all the faithful of either sex who had reached the use of reason should confess to their own (<a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>) <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at least once a year. If any should wish to confess to another <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, permission should be obtained from their own <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>; otherwise, the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> should be void. Shortly after this council the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> granted many privileges to the members of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Orders of <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> lately established, and exhorted the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to allow them to preach in public squares or churches and to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> in their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Dissensions between the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> and the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> brought from <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, in 1299, an edict requiring a request to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> that certain selected <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> should receive permission to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a>. If the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> refused, he by his plenary power authorized the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> to the same extent as the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. <a href="02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, in 1304, increased this privilege, but <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, in 1311, restricted the privileges to those granted by <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. At times the dissensions and disputes in the various countries of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> between the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> became very heated. An interesting account of the extent of these controversies in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> occurs in the "Catholic University Bulletin" (April, 1905, 195 sqq.), which gives the details of the arraignment of the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant friars</a> by the celebrated Fitz-Ralph, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, in 1357, before <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> undertook to remedy these troubles by restricting the privileges of the regulars, mainly in those things connected with the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> and the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which it sought to replace directly under the control of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The privileges of the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant friars</a> had been extended to other orders; in particular, to the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>During the period of Queen Elizabeth's <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> an <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> was appointed by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with episcopal authority to govern the <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> who remained in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. By <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, 6 May, 1631, regulars, especially <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, were exempted from his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; they derived through their own superiors authority from the Pope to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> and to administer the other <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Yet for elsewhere <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> insisted upon the legislation of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, as is shown by his <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 12 Sept., 1628: "We recall, annul from all colleges, chapters, religious <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, even the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, all <a href="07789a.htm">indults</a> to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> without examination by the ordinary." In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> the claim was made that the <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> was not the ordinary in a canonical sense. This continued even after the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in 1623, had appointed as <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> who should have the authority of an ordinary. Finally, in 1688, four <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> were appointed. By <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> (Constit. 80, 6 October, 1696) "all regulars, even <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, were to be subject to the vicar in whose district they were, for approbation with regard to hearing <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a>, for the <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> and for all <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> offices." Some <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> arose how far <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> should be entitled to the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> given to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, by his <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Apostolicum Ministerium" drawn up for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> (30 May, 1753), sought to put an end to these controversies by declaring that "the religious in accord with the regulations of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> must submit themselves to the examination and receive the permission of the ordinary to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> &mdash; all missionaries both secular and religious in the administration of the Sacraments and <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to be subject to the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, visitation, and correction of their respective <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>".</p>

<p>Not a few <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of note still claim that confessors belonging to the regular orders have <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> over the faithful generally in the tribunal of penance, the approbation of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> having been obtained. These seem to hold that the approbation is mainly the declaration of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> that a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is fit to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a>. However, it is well to note the definition and explanation of approbation given by <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in this <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>: "Approbation embraces two acts of which the first is of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the second of the will. It belongs to the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> to determine that the examined <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is, because of the proper and <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, fitted for the office of hearing <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a>. It, however, belongs only to the will to give the free and full faculty to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> and to pass judgment upon him who is submitted to the approver. The first is done by the examiner on whose fidelity and honesty he relies who gives the faculty to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> within the district assigned to him. The second immediately proceeds from the superior himself to whom it belongs to grant the faculty" (&#167; 8). Regulars certainly derive their <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over those of their own communities and permanent households through their own superiors, independently of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This privilege granted by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is probably founded on the principle that the superiors of regulars, having an office or charge with the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> annexed, should have ordinary <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over their subjects.
