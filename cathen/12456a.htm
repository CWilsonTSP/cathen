<p>The Sacred Congregation <em>de Propaganda Fide</em>, whose official title is "sacra congregatio christiano nomini propagando" is the department of the pontifical administration charged with the spread of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and with the regulation of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs in non-Catholic countries. The intrinsic importance of its <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> and the extraordinary extent of its authority and of the territory under its <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> have caused the cardinal prefect of Propaganda to be known as the "red <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>".</p>

<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<h3 id="A">First period</h3>

<p>Its establishment at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the seventeenth century was owing partly to the necessity of communicating with new countries then recently discovered, and partly to the new system of government by congregations adopted during the <a href="04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>. It is well known that, during this period, the defence and propagation of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> suggested to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the establishment of a complete system of administrative departments, to each of which was assigned some special branch of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. The propagation of the Faith was a matter of such vital importance as to demand for its work an entire congregation. The reconquest for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the lands severed from it was not of greater importance than the evangelization of the vast regions then being explored by <a href="06147a.htm">courageous</a> adventures. America, <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the Far East, opened up new lands, new peoples, new conquests; the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, conscious of her natural mission to evangelize the world, felt <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to act and to act quickly, especially as <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, while striving eagerly for commerce and colonial expansion, were also bent upon spreading everywhere the doctrines of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The origin of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda has been variously accounted for; in reality it is the result of slow evolution. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that it passed through two distinct periods, one formative and the other constitutive. The first period is that of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> commission <em>de propaganda fide</em> (before it had been constituted a definite pontifical department or ministry). This lasted from the time of <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> (1572-85) to 1622, when <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> established the congregation properly so-called. <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> instituted a primary commission composed of the three <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Caraffa, Medici, and Santorio, who were especially charged to promote the union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the <a href="05230a.htm">Oriental Christians</a> (Slavs, Greeks, <a href="14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, Egyptians, and <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>). Their meetings, held under the presidency of Cardinal Santorio, known as the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="13459d.htm">Santa Severina</a>, revealed certain urgent practical needs &mdash; e.g. the foundation of foreign <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, the printing of catechisms and similar works in many languages. Its efforts were successful among the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, both Western (as those of the Lebanon) and Eastern (as those of <a href="09558a.htm">Malabar</a>). After the death of <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> the rapid succession of four <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> in seven years arrested the progress of the commission's work. <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> (1592-1605), a <a href="12260a.htm">pontiff</a> of large and bold aims, was deeply interested in the commission, and caused its first meeting after his election to be held in his presence. He retained Santorio as its president: weekly meetings were held in that <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> palace, and every fifteen days the decisions and recommendations of the commission were referred to the pontiff. To this period belongs a very notable triumph, the union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> nation (the Little <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>) called the Union of Brest (1508).</p>

<h3 id="B">Second period</h3>

<p>The death of <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> revealed an essential weakness of the institution. It was a personal commission, depending for its very existence on the energy of its few members. Eventually the meetings of the three <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> ceased; at the same time an active propagation of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> was kept up among both <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and non-Christians. The practical demise of the commission made evident the necessity of providing for its permanence. The <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of accomplishing this belongs to <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> (1621-23). On 6 Jan., 1622, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> summoned thirteen <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and two <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, to whom he announced his intention of constituting a permanent and well-organized congregation for the propagation of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and his hearers were appointed members of the congregation. The preliminaries of organization were diligently carried on; on 22 June of the same year appeared the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Inscrutabili Divinae", by which the Sacred Congregation <em>de propaganda fide</em> was instituted, composed of thirteen <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and two <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, to whom were added a secretary and a consultor. Its first presidents were Cardinal Sauli, dean of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, and Cardinal Ludovisi, nephew of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and founder of the <a href="08157a.htm">Irish College</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On the same day provision was made for the support of the congregation by the Constitution "Romanum Decet". It assigned to Propaganda the <em>tassa dell' anello</em> (ring-tax) assessed on each newly appointed <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (500 gold scudi, later 600 silver scudi). On 14 Dec. of the same year was published the Constitution "Cum Inter Multiplices", and on 13 June, 1623, another Constitution, "Cum Nuper", both of which conferred on the congregation ample privileges and <a href="07690a.htm">immunities</a> in order to facilitate and accelerate its labours. When the financial management increased in importanee, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered that each of the thirteen <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> should direct it in turn; at a later date a single <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was placed at the head of the financial department. The death of <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> (1624) prevented the founder of the congregation from completing its organization; happily, his successor, <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1623-44), was Cardinal Barberini, one of the original thirteen members of the congregation.</p>

<p>After the death of Cardinals Sauli and Ludovisi, <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> directed that there should be but one prefect general of the congregation, and nominated to the office his brother, Cardinal Antonio Barberini (29 Dec., 1632). At the same time he appointed his nephew, a second Cardinal Antonio Barberini, as the auxiliary of the preceding, and later made him his successor. These two open the series of prefects general of Propaganda. It was clear to <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> that the impulse given to the establishment of <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a> by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had already produced excellent results, even in the vast province of the Propaganda, through the agency of the numerous national colleges then founded, e.g. at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the German, English, Greek, <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, Scots, and other colleges. But he also saw that it was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to establish a central <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the missions where young <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> could be <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a>, not only for countries which had no national college but also for such as were endowed with such institutions. It seemed very desirable to have, in every country, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in an international college where they could acquire a larger personal acquaintance, and establish in youth relations that might be mutually helpful in after life. Thus arose the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the Propaganda known as the Collegium Urbanum, from the name of its founder, <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. It was established by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Immortalis Dei", of 1 Aug., 1627, and placed under the immediate direction of the Congregation of Propaganda. The congregation itself developed so rapidly that it became eventually <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to divide its immense domain into various secretariates and commissions. This continuous increase of its labours dates from its very earliest years. In the beginning the meetings of the congregation were held in the presence of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; soon, however, the pressure of business grew to be so great that the general prefect and the general secretary were authorized to transact all current business, with the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of placing before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, at stated intervals, the more important matters, which is still the custom. In extent of territory, in external and internal organization, and in jurisdiction, the congregation has undergone modifications according to the needs of the times; but it may be said that its definite organization dates from about 1650.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Territorial jurisdiction</h2>

<p>As a general principle, it was understood that the territory of Propaganda was (apart from the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of all the Oriental rites) conterminous with those countries that were non-Catholic in government. Naturally there were, and are, exceptions: for example, <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> depends, ecclesiastically, upon the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, since it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to treat all Russian affairs though governmental channels. The territorial <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Propaganda was before the <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the Constitution "Sapienti Consilio" as follows: in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, Great Britain and <a href="06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="14347a.htm">Sweden</a> and <a href="11117b.htm">Norway</a>, <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> (Saxony, Anhalt, <a href="10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>, Schaumburg, <a href="11237b.htm">Oldenburg</a>, Lauenburg, <a href="07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, <a href="02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, L&uuml;beck, Schleswig-Holstein), <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="09465a.htm">Luxemburg</a>, some places in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> (Mesolcina and Calanca in the Grisons, <a href="10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> in the Canton of Valais), the Balkan peninsula (Bosnia, <a href="02694a.htm">Herzegovina</a>, and Greece); in the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a>, the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, Lower California, the Lesser Antilles (British and <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a>), <a href="08270a.htm">Jamaica</a> and <a href="07449b.htm">Honduras</a>, some missions in <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>, Patagonia; all Oceanica except the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a>; all <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> except the Russian possessions; all Africa. As to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Oriental rites, they are subject personally (that is, wherever they may be) to Propaganda. Their division by rites generally corresponds to their nationality. These rites are: the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, frequent (besides, of course, in <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>) in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; the pure Coptic Rite (in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>); the <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Coptic Rite, to which belong a few faithful in <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> and in the Italian colony of Eritrea; the pure <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, including some communities in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and a very few in Turkey; the Rumanian <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, with adherents among the Rumanians of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>; the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, or that of the Little Russians in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>; the <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, in <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> and in <a href="12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>; the <a href="10157b.htm">Melchite</a> <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> (Graeco-Syrian), which includes the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Greece, also hellenized natives of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine; the unmixed Syrian Rite (Western Syrian), or that of the Syrians of the plain of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine; the Syro-Maronite Rite (Western Syrian) or the (Syrian) <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> of Mount Lebanon; the Syro-Chaldean Rite (Eastern Syrian) i.e. <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> in the Persian Empire; the Malabar Rite (Eastern Syrian), i.e. the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Malabar in Southwestern <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>. Among most of these peoples there has set in a remarkable tide of emigration to the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a>, especially to North America, whither the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> and <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> <a href="10291a.htm">emigrate</a> in large numbers.</p>

<p>In the Constitution "Sapienti Consilio" of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (29 June, 1908), the plan was followed of entrusting to Propaganda those countries of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and America where the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> is not established. Great Britain, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="09465a.htm">Luxemburg</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> were therefore removed from its <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; on the other hand, all the vicariates and prefectures Apostolic of America and the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, which were formerly subject to the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, were placed under Propaganda. A departure from the general plan was in leaving Australia under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the latter congregation, with the addition of St-Pierre, in <a href="09731a.htm">Martinique</a>, and <a href="07044a.htm">Guadeloupe</a>. Another restriction of the powers of Propaganda effected by the new legislation was, that all matters appertaining to <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (particularly matrimony), rites, and religious congregations &mdash; as such, even though they were exclusively devoted to the work of the missions &mdash; were assigned to the care of the respective congregations: those of the Holy Office, the Sacraments, Rites, and Regulars.</p>

<h2 id="section3">External organization</h2>

<p>The organization of Propaganda is developed externally by means of delegations, <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, vicariates, prefectures, simple missions, and colleges. The Apostolic delegations are established to maintain immediate representatives of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in places where they seem to be needed by reason of the growth of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in organization and in numbers. Their personnel is composed of an <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> and an auditor, subject to Propaganda. They are as follows: in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, those of Constantinople and of <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a> (Athens); in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>, those of the East Indies (Kandy in Ceylon), of Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, and <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a> Minor (Mosul), of <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a> (Urumiah), of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> (Beirut); in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, that of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Arabia (Alexandria). The <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> as a rule consist of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who holds the title to the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> and administers the local government with the aid of a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter and a <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. A <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organization (<a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>) exists in the following Propaganda countries: in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, <a href="02694a.htm">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href="13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, Greece; in America, <a href="07044a.htm">Guadeloupe</a> and St-Pierre, Martinique; in Oceania, <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a> and New Zealand; in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>, and <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a>; in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the Mauritius and the Seychelles. The Oriental <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (Uniats), except those of the Abyssinian-Coptic, the Unmixed Greek, and the Graeco-Bulgarian Rites, are also organized in <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The <a href="15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> are missions at the head of each of which is placed a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> who acts as representative of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the local government. The prefectures Apostolic are missions of minor importance, each of which has at its head an ecclesiastic, not a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, with the title of <a href="12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>. Those territories of Propaganda which are not organized as <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are either vicariates or prefectures; their number increases rapidly, since every year some <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> is divided, or some prefecture is raised to the dignity of a vicariate or some new prefecture is created. The simple missions are few and mostly in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>. They represent an uncertain or transitory condition that may be readily strengthened by the establishment of an Apostolic prefecture.</p>

<p>The colleges are institutions for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, intended either to supply <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> for missions that have no native <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> or to give a better <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> to the native <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> for the apostolate in their own country. The central <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Propaganda is, as has been said, the Urban College, established in the palace of the congregation at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The immediate superiors are two <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, one the general secretary of the congregation, and the other the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. In this college may be found students from all the territories subject to Propaganda, but from nowhere else. The average number of its resident students is about one hundred and ten. It has its own <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, which are attended by many other students not subject to Propaganda &mdash; e.g. the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> College. Besides the preparatory training, these <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> offer courses of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and confer the academic degrees of Bachelor, Licentiate, and Doctor of Theology. The number of students in these <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> exceeds five hundred. In <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the College of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, for Italian missionaries (Lower <a href="03170a.htm">California</a> and <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>), and the College of St. Anthony, for <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries (especially in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>), are subject to Propaganda, which also exercises <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the following missionary colleges outside of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>: St. Calocerus, at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, for Italian missionaries to <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>; St. Charles, at <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> (China); Brignole-Sale, at <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a> (without local designation of mission); Instituto per la Nigrizia (for <a href="12627a.htm">negroes</a> of the Sudan), at <a href="15360a.htm">Verona</a>; College for African Missions, at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, especially for French missionaries to Africa; Seminary of Foreign Missions, at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (India, <a href="07765a.htm">Indo-China</a>, <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a>); Mill Hill Seminary, near <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, for the missionaries of the Society of St. Joseph (India, Central Africa, Malay Peninsula); House of St. Joseph, Rozendaal (for <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> students of the Mill Hill Society); House of St. Joseph, Brixen in the Tyrol (for German students of the same <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>); four colleges of the <a href="05054a.htm">Society of the Divine Word</a>, at Steyl (Holland), at Heiligen-kreuz (Germany), and at St. Gabriel, near <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, for the students of the same <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> whose missionary fields are in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> South America, Oceania, <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, and Africa; College of All Hallows, <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, for <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionaries; American College at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, for missionaries to the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. The national colleges at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> subject to the Propaganda are: the Greek, <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a> colleges. It also exercises <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the Albanian College at <a href="13648a.htm">Scutari</a>, the College of Pulo-Penang (Prince of Wales Island) in Indo-China, belonging to the <a href="14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a> at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> for the native Indo-Chinese <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The auxiliaries of this vast organization are all <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and regular congregations of men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> to which foreign missions are confided. Their number is very great. The principal orders (Benedictine, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> etc.) have charge of numerous missions. During the nineteenth century many regular <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> of missionary <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and missionary sisters entered actively, and with great success, on missionary labours under the direction of the congregation. The principal colleges of these auxiliary bodies (not directly subject to Propaganda) are: at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the Colleges of St. Fidelis (<a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>) and <a href="13352a.htm">St. Isidore</a> (<a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>), and the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Augustinian College; outside of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the college at Schooten near <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a> (Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary), the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the African Missions at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (<a href="15613d.htm">White Fathers</a>) etc.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Internal organization</h2>

<p>The internal organization of Propaganda is the result of almost three centuries of experience. All its works are carried on by means of a general <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> congregation, two <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> prefectures, and several permanent commissions. The general congregation is composed of all the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of Propaganda chosen by the Pope "Eminentissimi Patres Consilii Christiano nomini Propagando". The chief authority of Propaganda resides in this body. The creation and division of <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, vicariates, and prefectures, the selection of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and other ordinary superiors of missions, matrimonial causes, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> appeals, and the like, all come under its <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. It holds a regular meeting twice a month and deals alternately with the affairs of the Latin and the Oriental rites. Only the cardinal-members of Propaganda are present, together with two <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, the general secretary, and the secretary of the Oriental rites. To the general prefect of Propaganda, a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, belongs the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of despatching all current business and all matters pertaining to the General Congregation. He is the ordinary head of Propaganda. The General Prefecture has subject to it two secretariates: the General Secretariate and the Secretariate of Oriental rites. The general secretary (always a <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, Monsignor) is the chief assistant of the cardinal prefect, and the immediate head of the General Secretariate. He countersigns all letters addressed by the cardinal prefect to <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> outside of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and signs all letters from the prefecture destined to points in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (except to <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and ambassadors, letters for whom are signed by the cardinal prefect alone). An under-secretary has been added by the Constitution "Sapienti Consilio". The Secretary of the Oriental rites is the head of his secretariate, and is charged with <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> analogous to those of the general secretary, of whom he is independent.</p>

<p>Each of the secretariates has its <em>minutanti, scrittori</em>, and <em>protocollisti</em>. There are also the General Archives, and a Despatch Office. The <em>minutanti</em> (so called because one of their <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> is to prepare the minutes of decrees and letters which are afterwards re-copied by the <em>scrittori</em>) are officials occupied with the subordinate affairs of certain regions. We may note here the simplicity and the industry of the Propaganda secretariate: only six <em>minutanti</em> attend to the affairs of the countries of the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> subject to the congregation. Apropos of the authority of Propaganda we shall see what a vast deal of work is involved in the ordinary despatch of this work. The <em>minutanti</em>, in addition to making minutes of the ordinary acts of the secretariate, prepare the <em>ponenze</em>, i.e. the printed copies of the propositions or cases destined to come before the general <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> congregation. Every week each of the two secretariates holds a meeting (<em>congresso</em>) in the presence of the cardinal prefect, of its own secretary, and of the head of the other secretariate. At this meeting each <em>minutante</em> reports on all matters for the settlement of which reference to the pertinent set of documents may be <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, he gives oral informations etc. After hearing the report of the <em>minutante</em> and the opinion of the Secretary concerned, sometimes of all others present, the cardinal prefect issues an order to reply, or to defer the case, or to send it up to the general congregation. The <em>scrittori</em> copy all documents that are to be despatched, while the <em>protocollisti</em> stamp, number, and register all papers received and sent out. Records of the earliest proceedings of the congregation, dating from its first establishment, are preserved in the General Archives, or Record Office. Finally, there is the Despatch Office (<em>ufficio di spedizione</em>), which keeps its own register of all documents issuing from Propaganda, and sees to their actual forwarding. The office of consultor is filled gratuitously by a number of <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, to whom the secretariates send such of the <em>ponenze</em> as are of litigious nature &mdash; matrimonial causes, <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> difficulties, etc. These consultors are requested to express their opinions, which are then attached to the <em>ponenze</em> and presented therewith to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> at the General Congregation. The Oriental Secretariate employs interpreters &mdash; <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who translate all current correspondence in Arabic, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, etc., and who are sworn to perform their work faithfully.</p>

<p>The method of treatment applied by Propaganda to an ordinary case may be described as follows: A letter addressed to the congregation is opened by the cardinal prefect who annotates it with some terse official formula in Latin, embodying his first instructions (e.g. that a <em>pr&eacute;cis</em> of the antecedent correspondence relating to this matter is to be made). Then the letter goes to the <em>Protocollo</em>, where it is stamped and registered, and its object noted on the outside. The chief <em>minutante</em> reports on its object and on the note made by the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to the secretary concerned, and writes the corresponding order of the secretary. Supposing the order should be to write a letter, the folio is given to the <em>minutante</em>, who draws up his minute according to the instructions of the cardinal prefect and of the secretary, he then passes it on to the <em>scrittore</em>, who copies it, and verifies the copy. This copy, with all the correspondence in the case, is returned (supposing it to be matter to be sent away from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>) to the cardinal prefect, who signs it and remits it to the secretary. The secretary countersigns it and passes it on to the Despatch Office, which, after returning to the <em>protocollo</em> (for preservation) the other correspondence of the case under consideration, registers it, encloses all matter to be forwarded in an envelope, writes thereon the postal weight, and sends it on to the Accounting Office. Here the postal weight is verified, the stamps affixed, and the letter forwarded to the Post Office. By this system everything is under control, from the subject-matter of the correspondence to the cost of postage. The whole routine is completed with rapidity and regularity under the immediate responsibility of the several <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who have charge of the matter in its various stages.</p>

<p>Before the Constitution "Sapienti Consilio" the second <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> Prefecture of Propaganda was that of the cardinal prefect of finance, to whom are entrusted the finances of Propaganda, the expenses, subsidies etc. Decisions regarding subsidies pertained either to the cardinal prefect or to the General Congregation, or to the Board of Finance (<em>congresso economico</em>), which met as an executive committee for the transaction of the most important ordinary business with which the General Congregation was entrusted. This Prefecture of Finance was composed of the general prefect, the cardinal prefect of finance, and of some other <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of the General Congregation. <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, however, by the above mentioned Constitution, suppressed the Prefecture of Finance, and its functions are now discharged by the General Prefecture. With the Prefecture of Finance was joined the executive office of the Reverend Chamber of Chattels (<em>Azienda della Reverenda Camera degli Spogli</em>), i.e. the effective administration of the revenues collected from vacant <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> (<em>spogli</em>), one of the sources of revenue of Propaganda. The two permanent commissions of Propaganda are: one for the revision of Synodal Decrees (provincial or diocesan) in countries subject to Propaganda and one for the revision of <a href="09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the, Oriental rites. Each of these Commissions is presided over by a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, has for secretary a <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, and is always in close communication with its own secretariate.</p>

<h2 id="section5">Faculties</h2>

<p>The faculties (authority) of the Congregation of Propaganda are very extensive. To the other pontifical congregations are assigned quite specific matters: the only restriction on Propaganda is that of territory, i.e. while one congregation is concerned with rites, a second with <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and regulars, a third with marriage, a fourth with subsidies etc., Propaganda deals with all such matters, in a practical way, for all the countries subject to it. Thus, the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the settlement of a matrimonial case, the granting of an <a href="07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, are within the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Propaganda. The limits of its <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> are practical rather than theoretical; in general, it may be said that Propaganda is authorized to deal with matters peculiar to the other congregations, when such matters are presented as practical cases, i.e. when they do not raise questions of a technical character, or of general bearing, or are not of a class specifically reserved to some other department of the pontifical administration. This is more particularly <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of the Congregation of the Holy Office. Matrimonial cases are very frequently brought before Propaganda, especially those in which the marriage is alleged to be invalid, either as null from the beginning or because it was never consummated. The procedure in such cases is as simple as it is practical: Propaganda having been appealed to by one party, directs the local episcopal court to hold a canonical trial and to report its results to the congregation, it being understood that both parties, defendant and plaintiff, may protect themselves by legal counsel at their own expense. When the congregation has received the record of tlie local court it transmits the same to a consultor with a request for his opinion on the objective status of the question at issue (<em>pro rei veritate</em>). If the opinion be in favour of the nullity or of the non-consummation of the marriage, then the record, together with the opinion of the consultor, is sent on to a second consultor (<em>pro vinculi defensione</em>), whose <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to set forth the grounds, more or less conclusive, that can be adduced in favour of the validity, or consummation, of the marriage, and therefore of its indissolubility. The local record and the opinions of the consultors (<em>ponenza</em>) are then printed in as many copies as there are cardinal-judges in the congregation. This printed <em>ponenza</em> is sent to each of these <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> (the printed document is held to be secret, being looked on as <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>) that they may examine the matter. One of them (<em>cardinale ponente</em>) is selected to summarize the entire case, and to him are finally turned over the local record and the opinions of the consultors, with the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of reporting on the case at the next General Congregation. At this meeting, the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, after mature discussion, pronounce judgment. Their decision is immediately submitted to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who ratifies it, if he sees fit, and orders the proper <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> to be issued.</p>

<p>It should be added that all these proceedings are absolutely without expense to the litigants (<em>gratis quocumque titulo</em>), i.e. no one is ever called on for any payment to the congregation because or on account of any favour or decision. Thus, the wealthiest <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in America, <a href="05445a.htm">Great Britain</a>, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, or <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who has brought a matrimonial case before Propaganda, pays literally nothing, whatever the judgment may be. There are no chancery expenses, and nothing is collected even for the printing of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> records, consultors' opinions, etc. This fact shows how absurd are certain <a href="03190c.htm">calumnies</a> uttered against the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, especially in connexion with matrimonial cases, as though the annulment of a marriage could be procured at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the use of money. Were such the purpose of the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, it would not exempt the richest countries of the world &mdash; those precisely in which it is easiest for <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of opulence to institute legal proceedings &mdash; from any expense, great or small, direct or indirect.</p>

<p>Propaganda formerly possessed a valuable museum, the Museo Borgiano (situated in the palace), so called because it was given by <a href="02685a.htm">Cardinal Stefano Borgia</a>, who was general prefect early in the eighteenth century. It once contained precious Oriental <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a>, especially Sahidic (Coptic of the <a href="14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>) now preserved with other <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a> in the Vatican Library, for the greater convenience of students. It possesses at the present time an important cabinet of medals and many ethnological curiosities sent as gifts by missionaries in far distant lands, and scattered through the Palace of Propaganda are many valuable <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the old masters. Propaganda also conducted, until within recent years, the famous Polyglot printing press whence, for some centuries, issued <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> and <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> books, printed in a multitude of alphabets. Among its most noteworthy curios is a <a href="08297a.htm">Japanese</a> alphabet in wooden blocks, one of the first seen in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The Propaganda Press issued, among other publications, an official statistical annual of the missions conducted by the congregation (Missiones Catholicae cura S. Congreg. de Propaganda Fide descriptae), as well as the "Collectanea", a serial record of pontifical acts relating to the business of the congregation. In 1884 the Italian Government liquidated the real estate of Propaganda, leaving it only its palace, the neighbouring Mignanelli palace for the use of its <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, its printing press, and two villas used as summer resorts for the students of the Urban College.</p>

<p>One of the customs of Propaganda, worthy of special mention, is the gift of a fan to all employees at the beginning of the summer. This custom appears to have arisen in the early days, when fans were sent from <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> by the missionaries. It is customary for the Urban College to hold, at Epiphany, a solemn "Accademia Polyglotta", to symbolize the world-wide unity of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. At this <em>accademia</em> the Propaganda students recite poems in their respective mother tongues. Invited guests always find it very interesting to listen to this medley of the strangest languages and dialects. Another custom of the Urban College is that every graduate student (<em>alumno</em>), wherever he may be in the pursuit of his ministry, is bound to write every year a letter to the cardinal prefect, to let him <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> how the writer's work is progressing and how he fares himself. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> answers immediately, in a letter of paternal encouragement and counsel. By this means there is maintained a bond of affection and of mutual goodwill between the "great mother" &mdash; as the "Propagandists", or the alumni of Propaganda, designate the congregation &mdash; and her most distant sons.</p>

<p>The names of many distinguished <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> appear in the records of Propaganda, notably in the catalogue of its <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and officials. Among the cardinal prefects entitled to special mention are the following: Giuseppe Sagripanti (d. 1727), a meritorious reformer of Roman judicial procedure; the very learned <a href="02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> <a href="06471b.htm">Sigismondo Gerdil</a> (d. 1802); <a href="02685a.htm">Stefano Borgia</a>, patron of Oriental studies, protector of the savant <a href="15763a.htm">Zoega</a> (d. 1804); <a href="04262a.htm">Ercole Consalvi</a> (d. 1824), the great diplomatist, Secretary of State to <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, at whose death he was made prefect general of Propaganda by <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>; Mauro Cappellari later <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, who was prefect general from 1826 to his election as <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (1831). Among the General Secretaries (who usually become <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>) the following are particularly worthy of special mention: <a href="11521c.htm">Domenico Passionei</a>, created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1738; Nicol&ograve; Fortiguerra, a distinguished man of letters (d. 1739); the erudite <a href="09538a.htm">Angelo Mai</a>, secretary from 1833 to 1835. The list of missionaries sent forth by Propaganda has been long and glorious, containing the names of many <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The protomartyr of Propaganda is <a href="06069a.htm">St. Fidelis of Sigmaringen</a>, a German <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, missionary in Grisons, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> killed him in the village of Sercis, 24 April, 1622. He was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1746. Propaganda holds at all times a grateful memory of the Discalced <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. It was they who vigorously urged the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to found the congregation, foremost among them being Domenico di Ges&ugrave; e Maria, general of the order. In the original act of its foundation he appears as a member. Tommaso da Ges&ugrave;, another <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, opportunely published in 1613, at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, a Latin work on the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of preaching the Gospel to all nations.</p>
