<p>Born 17 March, 1809; died 5 March, 1878. He was the son of Charles March Phillipps of Garendon Park, Leicestershire, and Harriet Ducarel, a lady of <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> descent. He assumed the name of de Lisle in 1862, when on the death of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> he inherited the estates of the ancient <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of de Lisle.</p>

<p>He spent his earliest years at his birthplace and was brought up as a member of the <a href="01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, receiving his first religious instruction from his uncle, William March Phillipps, a high-church <a href="04049b.htm">clergyman</a>. In 1818 Ambrose was sent to a private <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at South Croxton, whence he was removed in 1820 to Maizemore Court School, near Gloucester, kept by the Rev. George Hodson; The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gloucester, having married Sophia March Phillipps, was his uncle by marriage, and so the boy had the advantage of spending <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holidays at the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace. At <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> he met for the first time a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the Abb&eacute; Giraud, a French &eacute;migr&eacute; <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, whose holy life struck the boy as inconsistent with what he had always heard of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. On one of his journeys to Gloucester he took the opportunity of questioning the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> as to the real <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The answers he received so excited his interest that he began to read all the books on the subject he could find in his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>. A visit to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1823 gave him his first acquaintance with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> liturgy. The effect on his mind was shown on his return home when he persuaded the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> to place a cross on the communion table, but this first effort to restore the cross to English churches was promptly suppressed by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11756b.htm">Peterborough</a> as savouring of Popery. At this time an incident occurred which left an indelible impression on his mind, and which he thus related to his subsequent biographer: "One day in the year 1823, as I was rambling along the foot of the hills in the neighbourhood of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, and meditating, as was my wont in those boyish days, over the strange <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> theory that the Pope of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> is the <a href="01559a.htm">Anti-Christ</a> of Prophecy, all of a sudden I saw a bright light in the heavens, and I heard a voice which said: 'Mahomet is the <a href="01559a.htm">Anti-Christ</a>, for he denieth the Father and the Son.' On my return home in the next holidays I looked for a <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a> and there I found those remarkable words, 'God neither begetteth nor is begotten.'"</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>About this time Mr. Hodson's <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was removed to Edgbaston, near <a href="02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, and here it was that the boy, now sixteen years old, had a remarkable dream "in which <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> seemed to reproach him with not having fully complied with the light he had received." Moved by this, he wrote to a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Rev. Thomas Macdonnell, asking him to meet him at Loughborough and receive him into the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Mr. Macdonnell met him and was surprised to find him so thoroughly instructed in <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, and after a few days he considered him sufficiently prepared to be received into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Ambrose informed both his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> and his schoolmaster, with the result that he was immediately removed from Mr. Hodson's <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, at that gentleman's desire, and returned home with his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, who arranged for him to continue his preparation for the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> under the private tuition of the Rev. William Wilkinson. He was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> every <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> to attend the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church, but did not join in the service. His own account of his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> will be found in Appendix I, in the first chapter of his biography below.</p>

<p>Ambrose Phillipps went into residence at <a href="15057a.htm">Trinity College</a>, Cambridge, 16 October, 1826. He found at the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> a congenial friend in Kenelm Digby, author of "Mores Catholici" and "The Broadstone of Honour", and, like himself, a recent convert. There was no <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> then at <a href="03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, and every <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> for two years these two young <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> used to ride over, <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, to <a href="11239a.htm">St. Edmund's College</a>, Old Hall, a distance of twenty-five miles, for Mass and Communion. It was on one of these visits to <a href="11239a.htm">St. Edmund's</a>, in April, 1828, that Phillipps was seized with a serious illness, having broken a blood-vessel on the lungs. The <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> recommended his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> to take him to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> for the winter, and this necessarily cut short his Cambridge career, so that he had to leave the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> without taking his degree. On his return to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1829, he became acquainted with the <a href="14214b.htm">Hon. and Rev. George Spencer</a>, then an <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, and his conversation was largely instrumental in leading to <a href="14214b.htm">Spencer's</a> conversion, as the latter admits in his "Account of my Conversion" &mdash; "I passed many hours daily in conversation with Phillipps and was satisfied beyond all expectations with the answers he gave me to the different questions I proposed about the principal tenets and practices of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>." The following winter (1830-1831) he again spent in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, on which occasion he met <a href="13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, who made a great impression on him.</p>

<p>On 25 July, 1833, Ambrose Phillipps married Laura Mary, eldest daughter of the Hon. Thomas Clifford, son of Hugh, fourth Lord Clifford of Chudleigh. The marriage <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> a most <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> union, and on this occasion Mr. Charles March Phillipps gave his son possession of the second <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> estate, the manor of Grace-Dieu in Leicestershire, which before the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> had been a <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of Augustinian <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Here Ambrose Phillipps built a new manor-house during the years 1833-34, and in the mean time he and his wife resided at Leamington, or at Garendon Park. Marriage made no difference to the ardour with which he devoted himself to the interests of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the spread of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and this at a time when the great influences of later days had not made themselves felt. Writing a few years before his death (Letter to the Rev. W. R. Brownlow, 10 Dec., 1869, Life, I, 349) he thus summed up the chief aims of his own life: "There were three great objects to which I felt after my own conversion as a boy of fifteen specially drawn by internal feeling for the whole space of forty-five years which have since elapsed. The first was to restore to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> the primitive monastic contemplative observance, which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> enabled me to do in the foundation of the <a href="15024a.htm">Trappist</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mount St. Bernard. The second was the restoration of the primitive <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> chant, my edition of which is now recommended by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a> for the use of <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The third was the restoration of the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Unity." In the foundation of the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey he received generous support from his friend John, Earl of <a href="13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, but it was he himself who conceived the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the ascetic aspect of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life should be presented to the English people. He gave both land and money, even crippling his own resources in providing the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> buildings. This work was begun in 1835 and completed in 1844, while, during the same period, he founded missions at Grace-Dieu and Whitwick. His disappointment was great when he found that the <a href="15024a.htm">Trappists</a> were prevented by their rule from undertaking active missionary work, because he attached the greatest importance to a supply of <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who would labour in English villages. "I would have them go about and preach everywhere on the foreign plan, in the fields or in the high roads even" (Letter to Lord Shrewsbury, 1839; Life, I, 105).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Besides the material assistance thus given to the spread of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, he devoted himself with persistent energy and <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> to spiritual means in which he believed even more strongly. In 1838 he joined his friend <a href="14214b.htm">Rev. George Spencer</a> in establishing and propagating the Association of Universal <a href="12345b.htm">Prayer</a> for the Conversion of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. This remarkable crusade, the results of which cannot be estimated, met with deserved success due to the untiring efforts which <a href="14214b.htm">Spencer</a> and Phillipps put forth. The sanguine hopes which both entertained of a speedy, if not immediate, return of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> lent force to the vehemence with which they urged their point, and accounts for the co-operation they everywhere met with. In a continental tour they made together, accompanied by Mrs. Phillipps and two of her children, in 1844, they passed through <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and North <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, meeting many distinguished <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and everywhere enlisting the sympathy of <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the cause. <a href="15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> was co-operating in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and soon the movement spread widely through the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world. In this work Mr. Phillipps laboured without ceasing; by interviews and by letters he aroused the interest and awakened the enthusiasm of others, so that he became the lay apostle of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the conversion of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; It is natural to see the <a href="06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of this <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the numerous conversions that resulted from the <a href="11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>, and in that movement Mr. Phillipps played a unique part. He was for some time the only <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who was in confidential correspondence with the leaders of the party at <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>; His ideal of the conversion of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> had always been corporate reunion; the reconciliation of the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> as a body, rather than individual conversions however numerous; and in the <a href="11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a> his sanguine spirit saw the beginning of this process. Accordingly, he set himself to remove obstacles on both sides and to act as a mediator, the more useful as he was unofficial; This he looked upon as his vocation, as his son has stated (Life and Letters, I, 254, note): "National Conversion by means of Corporate Reunion he likened unto the Apostolic practice of fishing with a net 'gathering in multitudes of all kinds of fishes.' And this he considered to be his own special call from on High, to prepare the way and hasten the time when the Divine Word should again be spoken to Peter, 'Cast your nets into the deep'." With this end in view Mr. Phillipps did much to obviate misunderstandings by promoting at Oxford fuller <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life; This he did by personal intercourse and correspondence with <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> and others, and by receiving several Oxford men as his guests at Grace-Dieu. His efforts were rewarded by the numerous conversions that took place and the impetus given to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause.</p>

<p>The restoration of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1850 was an event after his own heart, and he exerted himself to reconcile to it some of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> who thought it inexpedient. During the excitement that ensued throughout the country he wrote two pamphlets which met with much success: "A Letter to Lord Shrewsbury on the Re-establishment of the Hierarchy and the Present Position of Catholic Affairs", and "A few words on Lord John Russell's Letter to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05211a.htm">Durham</a>". The progress of events raised his hopes so high that he regarded the reconciliation of the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as imminent, and to hasten its fulfilment entered on a new crusade of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in which the co-operation of non-Catholics was desired. "The Association for promoting the Unity of Christendom", known as A. P. U. C., was founded on 8 September, 1857, by fourteen <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> including Father Lockhart, Fr. Collins, O. Cist., and Mr. de Lisle; the rest were <a href="01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, with one exception, a Russo-Greek <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. The only <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> incumbent on members, who might be either <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, or Greeks, was to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for the unity of the <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> body. At first the association progressed rapidly. Mr. de Lisle writing to Lord John Manners (Life, I, 415) said: "We soon counted among our ranks many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bishops and <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> and Dignitaries of all descriptions from <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> downwards; the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople and other great Eastern <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, the <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the Russlart Church. . . . I do not think any <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Bishops joined us, but a large number of <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the second order". He gave the number of members as nine thousand. The formation of this association was, however, regarded with distrust by <a href="09604b.htm">Dr. Manning</a> (afterwards <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a>) and other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who also took exception to Mr. de Lisle's treatise "On the Future Unity of Christendom". The matter was referred to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was finally settled by a <a href="12783b.htm">papal rescript</a> addressed "Ad omnes episcopos Angli&aelig;", <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 16 September, 1864, which condemned the association and directed the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to take steps to prevent <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from joining it. This was a great blow to Mr. de Lisle, who considered that "the authorities had been deceived by a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> relation of facts" (Letter to Editor of Union Review, 20 Dec., 1864; Life, I, 400). He however withdrew his name from the A. P. U. C. "under protest, as an act of submission to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>". The ground on which the association was condemned was that it subverted the Divine constitution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, inasmuch as its aim rested on the supposition that the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> Church consists partly of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in communion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, "partly also of the Photian Schism and the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican heresy</a>, to which equally with the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> belong the one Lord, the one <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and one <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>" (Rescript, in Life, I, 388). Mr. de Lisle's own pamphlet was not censured, but the condemnation of the A. P. U. C. was regarded by him as the death-blow of his hopes for the <a href="15132a.htm">reunion of Christendom</a> during his own lifetime. But his own <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in it persevered and influenced his views in other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs. Thus he warmly supported the attendance of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, and he even approved of the abortive project of a <a href="05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> English Church.</p>

<p>The rest of his life passed without any very special incident, though he continued ever to take an interest in public affairs as affecting the fortunes of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in the same connexion he carried on intimate and cordial correspondence with men so different as <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a>, Gladstone, and <a href="10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>. He counted among his friends John, Earl of <a href="13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, <a href="15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, <a href="12558b.htm">Pugin</a>, Faber, and many other well-known <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and though he differed on many points from <a href="09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> and <a href="15552c.htm">Dr. W.G. Ward</a> he remained on friendly terms with both. He died a holy death at Garendon, leaving his saintly wife and eleven of his sixteen children surviving him. Besides the pamphlets mentioned above he wrote a remarkable work, "Mahometanism in its relation to Prophecy; or an Inquiry into the prophecies concerning Anti-Christ, with some reference to their bearing on the events of the present day" (1855). He also translated Father Dominic's "Lamentations of England" (1831); <a href="09634a.htm">Manzoni's</a> "Vindication of Catholic Morality" (1836); <a href="10513b.htm">Montalembert's</a> "St. Elizabeth of Hungary" (1839); Rio's "La petite Chouannerie" (1842); "Maxims and Examples of the Saints" (1844); and he compiled: "Manual of Devotion for the Confraternity of the Living Rosary" (1843); "Catholic Christian's Complete Manual" (1847); "The Little Gradual" (1847); "Thesaurus anim&aelig; Christian&aelig;" (1847); "Sequenti&aelig; de Festis per Annum" (1862). He also wrote many articles for the press, of which many were issued in pamphlet form, but a complete bibliography has not hitherto been compiled.</p>
