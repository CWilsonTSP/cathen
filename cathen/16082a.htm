<p>FERNANDO PO, in West Africa.--In 1855 a mission was established in the island of Annobon, Corisco, and Fernando Po under R. P. Miguel Martinez, of Toledo. In 1857 the mission became a <a href="12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a> and was entrusted to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; in 1860 their <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was extended to the mainland. After thirteen years' labour they gave up the mission owing to difficulties with the Spanish Government, as well as to the severity of the climate.

Previously it had formed part of the Vicariate of Zanguebar (Zanzibar). On 10 July, 1897, its southern boundaries were extended to Cape Delgado, and its inland limits made to embrace Magwangwara.

With him were slain two <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and two <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters. The name of the vicariate was changed on 10 Aug., 1906, to Dar-es-Salem &mdash; the name of the town where the <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> resides. The boundary between the Vicariates of Bagamoyo and Dar-es-Salem was modified by a <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 7 May, 1913; it is now the line separating Bagamoyo and Morogoro from Dar-es-Salem and Rufiji; then the rivers Ruaha and Umeroke and finally the railway from the Indian Ocean to Tabora.
