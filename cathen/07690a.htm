<p>(<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>immunitas</em>).</p>

<p>Immunity means an exemption from a legal <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> (<em>munus</em>), imposed on a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> or his <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> by law, custom, or the order of a superior (lex 214, sqq. De verb. signif., 1. 50, tit. 16). This exemption is therefore a kind of privilege and follows the same rules. In <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> terminology, immunities are exemptions established by law in favour of sacred places and sacred things, <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a> and <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. If we consider, not only actual exemptions, which vary at divers times and in divers countries, but their principle, immunity may be defined as the exemption of <a href="11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> and <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> from secular <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. This principle varies necessarily in its application according to circumstances.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In strongly hierarchical <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, for instance in a <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, immunities play an important part; on the other hand, in our modern <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, where men are much more on a basis of equality, immunities are less useful; they are looked on with disfavour by the highly centralized <a href="02137c.htm">secular power</a>, and suffer, as is evident, much more restriction.</p>

<h2>Division</h2>

<p>An immunity according to its object, is local, real, or personal. Local immunity refers to places <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Divine worship, to churches; real immunity, to <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a>. personal immunity, to <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, their lawsuits and trials and, in a measure, to their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. We shall briefly consider each of these three kinds as viewed by canon law, after which we shall see to what extent they are in vogue in our modern <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>.</p>

<p>A. Local immunity withdraws places dedicated to Divine worship from secular <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and preserves them from acts that would profane the respect due to holy places. It implies likewise the right of a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> to remain in a place <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, so that the public authorities may not remove delinquents therefrom. This is the right of asylum (q.v.); it was greatly restricted by canon law, and is now abandoned everywhere without any formal protest from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. As local immunity arises from a place or building being dedicated to Divine worship, it must be considered as attaching not only to churches that have been solemnly <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, but also to those that have merely been blessed, and to <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> and <a href="11271a.htm">oratories</a> legitimately erected by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; it extends likewise to the accessory buildings, <a href="13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, <a href="15387a.htm">porch</a>, yard, <a href="02394d.htm">belfry</a>, and to the neighbouring <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> ground and the burial ground (ch. ii, 9, De immunit. eccles. lib. III, tit. 49). Among the profane acts forbidden in churches by canon law, not to mention those that are prohibited by their very nature, we may cite: criminal secular trials (c. v, <em>h. t.</em>) even under penalty of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; civil secular trials (c. ii, <em>h. t.</em> in VI); but acts of <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> (even judicial) are not forbidden. Commerce and trading are prohibited, likewise fairs, markets, and in general all purely civil meetings, as secular deliberative assemblies (<em>parlamenta</em>), unless permission has been granted by the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, whose <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> are thus safeguarded. The employment of force to enter sacred places, breaking down doors, interrupting or preventing Divine service, are violations of local immunity. This crime was formerly punished with <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> <em>ipso facto</em> incurred, but this is no longer enforced by the Constitution <a href="01645a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Sedis"</a>. This kind of immunity exists in our day almost unimpaired; the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> recognizes the right of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to the internal administration of their churches and thus guarantees, either directly or indirectly, their exclusive application to Divine service.</p>

<p>B. Real immunity withdraws <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a> from secular <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> so that it is free from public charges, in particular from taxation. We are not speaking here of the sacred buildings or of the objects required in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ceremonies and the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which by their nature must not be used for profane purposes, but of things that have been set aside to furnish revenues for the churches, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the different works organized and controlled by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; we refer to <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a>, in its widest sense, movable and immovable: lands, buildings, episcopal residences, presbyteries, <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, etc., also titles to <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, real <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, incomes, etc. All these properties, sources of revenue to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and her <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>, were exempt from the charges and taxes imposed on the corresponding properties of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>. And, as this exemption was general and public, <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> could not offer or consent to any taxes on the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of their <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>. As a matter of fact, this immunity, recognized in principle by the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Christian States, did not result in an actual freedom from taxation; not only was <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a> subject to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> taxes, annates, <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and others, but it contributed largely to the public expenditure of the State; however, the principle of immunity was protected by having the subsidies voted by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> themselves as gratuitous gifts, after <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authorization. The amount of the subsidy was to be settled by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in accordance with canon xix of the Lateran Council of 1179 (c. iv, <em>h. t.</em>); and canon xlvi of the Lateran Council, of 1215, protects the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> against excessive demands of princes, by requiring, under pain of nullity, the previous consent of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (c. vii, <em>h. t.</em>). The voting of the contributions from <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, as is well known, was the principal object of the celebrated Assemblies of the French <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> (Bourlon, "Les assembl&eacute;es du clerg&eacute;", Paris, 1907). At present, the <a href="12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> has greatly decreased, and no longer enjoys real immunity; except as a matter of principle, it hardly differs from secular <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. However, with regard to buildings used for Divine service, and the movable <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> appertaining thereto, most Governments consider them as <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of public utility, dedicated to the service of the community, and therefore exempt from taxation. That is also the reason why in several of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, charitable and <a href="13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> pay no taxes; in this, however, it is impossible to recognize an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> immunity properly so called, based on the <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> of these establishments.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>C. Personal immunity is that which withdraws <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> from secular <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, on account of their perpetual dedication to the service of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. It is not concerned with the withdrawal from secular <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of acts of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> as <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and in their official capacity; it is clear that, from such a point of view, they are solely under <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, without there being any necessity to having recourse to any immunity. Personal immunity withdraws them from secular <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in matters where other citizens would be subject to it. If <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> are <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to keep the ordinary <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> they take their orders and commands solely from <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; the penal sanctions which they would incur for violating the ordinary <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> may not be imposed on them by secular judges, in virtue of the privilege of the tribunal. This privilege withdraws the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> entirely from secular judicial <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, so that not only spiritual lawsuits of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, but also temporal lawsuits whether the suits be criminal or civil, fall within the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ecclesiastical judges (see CLERICAL PRIVILEGES). The privilege of the tribunal has disappeared almost completely today, with the consent, whether tacit or explicit, of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the various <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a> (see Nussi, "Quinquaginta Conventiones", Rome, 1869, &#167; xx). Further, personal immunity exempts the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> from public <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> imposed by law on citizens in general or on certain classes, and also from taxation and imposts. Some of these public <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> were considered <em>servile</em>, for instance, statute labour, the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of contributing personally to the upkeep of roads and bridges; others were considered <em>honourable</em>, as guardianship, the municipal magistracy (<em>curia</em>), military service. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, like the nobility, by reason of their rank, the highest of all, were exempt from servile <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>; they were excused from the others, by reason of their withdrawal from secular business. The first class of <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> has disappeared in our days; as to the second, the immunity has been maintained to a large extent under modern <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> such is the manifest incompatibility of the <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> ministry and certain of these offices. Thus <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> are not called on to act as jurymen in criminal affairs. In some countries, <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> filling positions recognized by the State are exempt from guardianship (for instance, <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>), and are excluded from public or municipal offices in the localities where they exercise their <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions. As to military service, in countries where it is compulsory the condition of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> varies. They may be entirely exempt, as in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, or they may be under restricted <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a>, as in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> or <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; finally, they may be placed on an exact equality with the other citizens, as now happens in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Such a violation of their immunity is not one that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> tolerates and accepts in silence; the opposition between military service and the vocation of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of peace, is only too violent and apparent; the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> have, therefore, protested against the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> which in divers countries compel the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to serve in the army (cf. the letter of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> to Cardinal Nina, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 August, 1878). Finally, <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> were exempt from taxes and imposts, whether purely personal, as the poll-tax; or real, as <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> tax. It must be recognized however that the latter exemption was practically disregarded by all nations except the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. It has now completely disappeared.</p>

<h2>Juridical origin</h2>

<p>The <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em> of all this immunity is the respect due to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, which is shared by those things and <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> dedicated to His worship. Viewed in this light it springs from both natural and <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. Moreover, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that if we consider the sacred ministry and worship formally, the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, the <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, and their acts are subject, by Divine right, only to religious authority, but that is not properly speaking an immunity. It is only one aspect of the greater question of the independence of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of the civil <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. The precise point in question is the juridical origin of the immunities we have just spoken of, which do not directly concern their acts as <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of religion; are these immunities of right Divine, or of positive canon law, or even of secular law, that is, only generous concessions of princes, which might be withdrawn at will? No one disputes that immunities are part of the positive ecclesiastical law; every one admits that they have been inserted in civil <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> else they could not have been applied. But were canon law and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> already bound by <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>? If they were, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> would be unable to make concessions in the matter of immunities, and the civil <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> in suppressing them would be essentially <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> and without force. In answering this question we meet with two extreme opinions, but the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> will be found between them. A number of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists (cf. <a href="06048a.htm">Ferraris</a>, "Prompta Biblioth.", s.v. "Immunitas", a. I, n. 7, 14) hold that the immunities are established by <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, with the exception of the right of asylum. They point out that in all nations, the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> to the Deity of <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a>, <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, and <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, placed them outside ordinary conditions, and made them specially exempt; in the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> this was the case in regard to a worship that only prefigured the <a href="15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>; the custom of exemptions dates back to the very origin of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; finally, certain canonical texts speak of the immunities as being of Divine right. Opposed to this we have the "regalist" jurists declaring that "the immunities of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> are favours which the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> received from sovereigns, not from <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and councils" (H&eacute;ricourt, Les Lois eccl&eacute;siastiquesde France", H, v, viii); and Governments have acted in accordance with this view.</p>

<p>These "regalists" say that the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, allowance made for their spiritual functions, are on a level with ordinary citizens in all other matters; that <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a>, although legally applied to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the expenses of Divine worship, nevertheless, does not cease to be essentially a temporal thing, and consequently subject to the <a href="02137c.htm">secular power</a>; that all immunities originate in concessions of emperors and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes. Recent canonists hold a middle opinion (cf. <a href="03467c.htm">Cavagnis</a>, "Instit. juris publ. eccles.", II, 323 sq., 4th ed., Rome, 1906). They remark that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has never given an official answer to the question, but that it seems possible to ascertain exactly what she thinks from two facts: on the one hand she protests against the civil <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> that suppress the immunities, and claims them as belonging to her of right (cf. prop. 30, 31 and 32 of the "Syllabus"); she therefore does not consider them to be concessions granted freely by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. On the other hand, yielding to the conditions and circumstances of modern <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, she makes no effort to revive the immunities that have disappeared, at least the right of asylum and exemption from <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> taxes, which is conclusive that she does not consider them unchangeable prescriptions of the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>. These authors conclude that the immunities are founded in Divine right, but emanate from positive canonical legislation; they repeat with the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, c. 20, "De Ref."), that immunities arise by Divine direction and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sanctions, "divin&acirc; ordinatione et ecclesiasticis sanctionibus". To the partisans of the first view they answer that the custom of ancient races, the prescriptions of the Mosaic law, and the practice of the early ages of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> prove indeed that immunities are in conformity with <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, but they do not demonstrate the existence of a law properly so called. What the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a> pointed out required to be defined and completed by positive legislation. To the "regalists" they reply that all the immunities did not originate from imperial or princely concessions, several of them having been established positively by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, in agreement, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, with the <a href="02137c.htm">secular powers</a>; moreover, that the others have been "canonized" and inserted in ecclesiastical law and constitute for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> an acquired right; besides they are sufficiently based on <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a> not to be considered as purely gratuitous favours conferred by the State on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This middle theory adopts therefore all that is reasonable in the two extreme opinions.</p>

<h2>Brief history of the immunities</h2>

<p>The history of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> immunities is a chapter of the more extensive history of the relations of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Moreover, some of them, as the right of asylum and the privilege of the tribunal, have had specially chequered careers. In general, we may say that the immunities developed with the growth of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, then they have been continuously restricted in proportion as the separation of the two powers became accentuated and the State became laicized. As long as the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>, as such, was religious and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> on mixed questions settled by agreement, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> the first order in the State, and the public authorities helped to enforce the legislation and to carry out the decisions of the officially-recognized <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, immunities were, in a certain sense, a social necessity; and that was especially <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of a state of <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> wherein privileges and private <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> played an important part, as in the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> days. The <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> system adopted the immunities of the <a href="09079a.htm">Roman law</a>. When the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> was recognized by the Roman empire, nothing seemed more natural than to grant it immunities and privileges equal to those that had been enjoyed by the religion that had hitherto been the official one. Constantine granted immunity to the churches, and to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> an exemption from all public and municipal charges and even certain taxes, as the poll-tax (Cod. Theod., lib. XVI, tit. ii, "De episcopis", especially lex 2). If the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> placed difficulties in the way of the <em>curiales</em> who wished to join the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, it opposed the bringing of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> into the <em>curia</em> (ibid., leg. 7,9,11) As to <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, not only could it be freely acquired and held by the churches, but being devoted to a public service, it was exempted by Constantine from common taxes and extraordinary charges (lib. XI, tit. i and xvi). This <a href="09053a.htm">legislation</a> maintained by <a href="08578b.htm">Justinian</a>, was received and confirmed by the imperial German law (Auth. "Item nulla", of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, according to lex 2 of the Cod. lib. I, tit. iii, "De episcopis"). In the kingdoms of the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>, the <a href="12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> did not at first enjoy a general immunity, but it was often granted by a special concession of the king; later, the exemption was common, but repaid, doubtless more than equitably, by the contributions of which we have spoken, and which were gratuitous in nothing but the name (<em>dona gratuita</em>). The legislation of the <a href="04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, which corresponds, as is well known, with the period of the greatest authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, represents the greatest extension of the personal and real immunities; it is the legislation explained above theoretically in vigour; it has remained as a kind of ideal, never realized in practice. As early as the fifteenth century, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> immunities had been curtailed more than once by temporal princes; the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, c. 20, "De Ref."), after confirming the canon law concerning immunities, addressed a solemn warning to the <a href="02137c.htm">secular powers</a>, the emperor, kings, and princes; it recalled to them their <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of defending the churches, <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> against all who attacked their "liberty, immunity, and <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>". But the movement was too strong to be thus easily overcome; on the contrary, it increased, and the end of the eighteenth century saw in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the suppression not only of immunities but even of <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a>. The example was followed sooner or later by other countries, and there resulted an almost complete extinction of immunities, as we have explained above.</p>

<p>Immunities were maintained longer in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and especially in the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, owing to the care of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and especially of the Congregation of Immunity. In the movement for a thorough <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform following the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> could not neglect immunities; <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> had confided this matter to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> forming the "Congregation of Bishops"; but shortly afterwards, <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Inscrutabile" (22 June, 1626), established a special congregation, which he called "Congregatio Immunitatis". This congregation, composed like the others of a certain number of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, one of whom was its Prefect, assisted by a secretary, a fiscal lawyer, two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> charged with drawing up reports, and a staff of lower officials, was appointed to look after the defence and enforcement of immunities. It was kept busily occupied and gave many decisions; no official collection of these has been made, but the Abbot General of <a href="03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, Pierre Andr&eacute; Ricci, published in 1708 a repertory of them, arranged alphabetically, "Synopsis, decreta et resolutiones Sac. Cong. Immunitatis super controversiis jurisdictionalibus complectens"; the work was re-edited with numerous additions by <a href="10525a.htm">Mgr. Barbier de Montault</a>, Paris, 1868. Although diminished, the work of this congregation continued till the invasion of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the Italian troops in 1870; it was then joined to the Sacred Congregation of the Council and was suppressed in the recent reorganization of the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> by <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in 1908.</p>
