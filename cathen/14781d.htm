<p>(TORONTINA).</p>

<p>Located in the <a href="11254a.htm">Province of Ontario</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. When constituted a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, it embraced all Upper <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> west of the Newcastle district, but at present is limited to the counties of York, Simcoe, <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, Peel, Dufferin, Lincoln, and Welland. The first missionary in this district was <a href="09107c.htm">Father Joseph Le Caron</a>, a Recollect, who celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> on the shore of Georgian Bay in 1615. Thus began the <a href="07565a.htm">Huron</a> missions, the story of which, replete with heroism of Recollect and <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, is told elsewhere in this work; suffice it to say here that all the missions among that people and some of those attempted among their Neutral kindred lay within the present archdiocesan limits. During the century and a half following the destruction of these nations, a few <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are known to have been in this district; among these were <a href="07215c.htm">Father Hennepin</a>, in 1678, and <a href="12075d.htm">Abb&eacute; Picquet</a>, who visited Fort Rouill&eacute; (Toronto) in 1752. A <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> was attached to the troops at <a href="10779c.htm">Newark</a> (Niagara-on-the-Lake) in 1794, and about the same time missionaries began to visit occasionally the few <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of York (Toronto) and the neighbouring territory. Amongst these was Father Burke, afterwards <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Nova Scotia, who held the office of <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Upper <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. After 1804 Father Macdonell came as often as his extended field of labour allowed, and, when <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, resided at York for some years. In 1826 there were two resident <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in this region, one at <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, the other at Niagara.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="08658a.htm">Diocese of Kingston</a> was divided on 17 December, 1841, and Father Power, bishop-elect of the western portion, having permission to name his episcopal city, chose Toronto, the provincial capital. The first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Michael Power, born at <a href="07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, N.S., 17 Oct., 1804, was <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the Diocese of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> when raised to the episcopate. Consecrated on 8 May, 1842, he laid the cornerstone of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, introduced the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and made arrangements to bring the Loreto <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> to the diocese. Appointed by the Government to the Council of Public Instruction, he presided over that body. He died on 1 Oct., 1847, of typhus contracted while attending the immigrants at the fever-sheds. His successor, Armand-Francois-Marie Comte de Charbonnel, a Sulpician, born at Monistrolsur-Loire, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, 1 Dec., 1802, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in the Sistine Chapel, 26 May, 1850. He gave his paternal estates to liquidate the <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, introduced the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a> (Annonay), the <a href="08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, and the <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, and was present at the First and Second Provincial Councils of Quebec. His <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided in 1856 by the erection of <a href="07123a.htm">Hamilton</a> and <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> as <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>. With his fellow-bishops of Upper <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, he engaged in the struggle for separate <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, which had a successful outcome under his successor. In 1860 he resigned to join the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, being appointed <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14166a.htm">Sozopolis</a>, and afterwards titular <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the same see. He died on 29 March, 1891. His successor at Toronto was John Joseph Lynch, C.M., who was born at Clones, County Monaghan, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 6 Feb., 1816. As a <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, he did missionary and professorial work in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, being <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> which he founded at Niagara Falls, New York, when appointed (26 Aug., 1859) <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aechinas, and coadjutor with right of succession to Bishop de Charbonnel.</p>

<p>On the resignation of the Bishop de Charbonnel on 26 April, 1860, Bishop Lynch became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toronto. He brought to the diocese the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Sisters of the Precious Blood, and Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge; was present at the Third and Fourth Provincial Councils of Quebec; and also at the Council of the Vatican, where he favoured the immediate <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a>, and acted on the commissions on missions and Oriental rites. During the council (18 Mar., 1870) his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was raised to <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank. He died on 12 May, 1888. In 1879 Archbishop Lynch received as auxiliary Timothy O'Mahony, <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eudocia, and former <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01740b.htm">Armidale</a>, <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a>, who died on 8 Sep., 1892. John Walsh, second <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, born at Mooncoin, County Kilkenn, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 23 May, 1830, was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the Diocese of Toronto of which he was <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> when appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sandwich in 1867. On 13 August, 1889, he became <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toronto, where he renovated the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and founded St. John's Industrial School. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Race Convention of 1896 was organized at his suggestion. He was noted as a writer and preacher. His death occurred on 31 July, 1898. Denis O'Connor, C.S.B., his successor, was born at Pickering, <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, 28 March, 1841. A <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a>, he taught for several years in that community, being superior of the Assumption College, Sandwich, when chosen <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09353a.htm">London, Ontario</a>, where he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 19 Oct., 1890. On 27 January, 1899, he was created <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toronto. Here he established several new <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, gave special attention to conferences for the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to the study of <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> by the young. In 1908 he resigned, being appointed titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>. He died at St. Basil's Novitiate, Toronto, 30 June, 1911. His successor, Fergus Patrick McEvay, was born in Lindsay, <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, 8 December, 1856. <a href="11279a.htm">Ordained</a> for <a href="08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, he was transferred to the new <a href="11756b.htm">Diocese of Peterborough</a>, where he was <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and then went to Hamilton with Bishop Dowling. There he was appointed <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and received <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> honours of private chamberlain and domestic <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>. Consecrated <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09353a.htm">London, Ontario</a>, 6 Aug. 1899, he was promoted to Toronto, 13 April, 1908. He founded new <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, rebuilt the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> palace, erected a new <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> residence, and began St. Augustine's Seminary, donated by Mr. Eugene O'Keefe (private chamberlain to His Holiness). At the First National Council of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, Archbishop McEvay was chamberlain of the commission <em>ad novas materias</em>; he was also instrumental in founding the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> Extension Society of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. He died on 10 May, 1911.</p>

<p>Civil incorporation took place on 25 March, 1845, under the title of "The Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation for the Diocese of Toronto in Canada". All <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> in the archdiocese, except that belonging to <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, is vested in this corporation. There have been three <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> (1842, 1863, 1882) and one provincial council (1875). Both <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people are for the most part of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> extraction, with a small percentage of English and Scotch. There are however three <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> exclusively French, three mixed (French and English), 1 for Poles, <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a>, <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, and Syrians, respectively, and one Indian mission.
