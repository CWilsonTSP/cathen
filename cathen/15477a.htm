<p>This article will deal not with natural but with <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> visions, that is, visions due to the direct intervention of a power superior to man. <a href="02645b.htm">Cardinal Bona</a> (De discret. spir., xv, n. 2) distinguishes between visions and apparitions. There is an <em>apparition</em> when we do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that the figure which we see relates to a real being, a <em>vision</em> when we connect it with a real being. With most mystics we shall consider these terms as synonymous.</p>

<h2>Three types of visions</h2>

<p>Since <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (De gen. ad litt., 1. XII, vii, n. 16) <a href="10663b.htm">mystical</a> writers have agreed in dividing visions into corporeal, <a href="07672a.htm">imaginative</a>, and <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a>.</p>

<h3>Corporeal vision</h3>

<p>Corporeal vision is a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> manifestation of an object to the eyes of the body. It may take place in two ways: either a figure really present strikes the retina and there determines the physical phenomenon of the vision, or an agent superior to man directly modifies the visual organ and produces in the composite a sensation equivalent to that which an external object would produce. According to the authorities the first is the usual manner; it corresponds to the invincible <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> of the seer, e.g. Bernadette at <a href="09389b.htm">Lourdes</a>; it implies a minimum of <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> intervention if the vision is prolonged or if it is common to several <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. But the presence of an external figure may be understood in two ways. Sometimes the very substance of the being or the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> will be presented; sometimes it will be merely an appearance consisting in a certain arrangement of luminous rays. The first may be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of living <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> and even, it would seem, of the now glorious bodies of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, which by the eminently probable <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> phenomenon of <a href="02568a.htm">multilocation</a> may become present to men without leaving the <a href="07170a.htm">abode of glory</a>. The second is realized in the corporeal apparition of the unresurrected dead or of pure spirits.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3>Imaginative vision</h3>

<p>Imaginative vision is the sensible representation of an object by the act of <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> alone, without the aid of the visual organ. Sometimes the subject is aware that the object exists only in his <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>, that it is a purely reproduced or composite image. Sometimes he projects it invincibly without, which is the case in <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> hallucination. In natural <a href="07672a.htm">imaginative</a> vision the <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> is stirred to action solely by a natural agent, the will of the subject, an internal or an external force, but in <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="07672a.htm">imaginative</a> vision an agent superior to man acts directly either on the <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> itself or on certain forces calculated to stir the <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>. The sign that these images come from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> lies, apart from their particular vividness, in the lights and <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> of sincere <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> which accompany them, and in the fact that the subject is powerless to define or fix the elements of the vision. Such efforts most frequently result in the cessation or the abridgement of the vision. Imaginative apparitions are ordinarily of short duration, either because the human organism is unable to endure for a long time the <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> done to it, or <a href="07672a.htm">imaginative</a> visions soon give place to <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> visions. This kind of vision occurs most frequently during sleep; such were the <a href="05154a.htm">dreams</a> of <a href="11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and <a href="10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> (Genesis 41; Daniel 2). <a href="02645b.htm">Cardinal Bona</a> gives several reasons of expediency for this frequency: during sleep the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is less divided by multiplicity of thoughts, it is more passive, more inclined to accept, and less inclined to dispute; in the silence of the senses the images make a more vivid impression.</p>

<p>It is often difficult to decide whether the vision is corporeal or <a href="07672a.htm">imaginative</a>. It is certainly corporeal (or extrinsic) if it produces external effects, such as the burnt marks left on an object by the passing of the <a href="04764a.htm">Devil</a>. It is <a href="07672a.htm">imaginative</a> if, for example, the image persists after one has closed one's eyes, or if there are no traces of the external effects which ought to have been produced, such as when a ball of fire appears above a <a href="11726a.htm">person's</a> head without injuring it. The time most conducive to these visions is a state of <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, when the exercise of the external senses is suspended. However, although the question has been discussed among mystics, it seems that they may also be produced outside of this state. This is the opinion of <a href="01374b.htm">Alvarez de Paz</a> (De grad. contemp., 1., V, pt. III, cii, t. 6) and of <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (De servorum Dei beatif., 1. III, c. i, n. 1). Imaginative vision may be either representative or symbolic. It is representative when it presents an image of the very object to be made known: such may have been the apparition to <a href="08409c.htm">Bl. Joan of Arc</a> of <a href="03445a.htm">St. Catherine</a> and <a href="09652b.htm">St. Margaret</a>, if it was not (which is more probable) a luminous vision. It is symbolic when it indicates the object by means of a sign: such as the apparition of a ladder to <a href="08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, the apparition of the Sun, Moon, and stars to the patriarch <a href="08506a.htm">Joseph</a>, as were also numerous prophetic visions.</p>

<h3>Intellectual visions</h3>

<p>Intellectual visions perceive the object without a sensible image. Intellectual visions in the natural order may apparently be admitted. Even when we hold with the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> that every <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is derived form some image, it does not follow that the image cannot at a given time abandon the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> to itself. The <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision is of the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> when the object known exceeds the natural range of the understanding, e.g. the essence of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, certain existence of the <a href="06701a.htm">state of grace</a> in the subject of another, the intimate nature of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="15047a.htm">Trinity</a>; when it is prolonged for a considerable time (<a href="14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a> says that it may last for more than a year). The intervention of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> will be recognized especially by its effects, persistent light, Divine <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, peace of <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, inclination towards the things of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the constant fruits of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision takes place in the pure understanding, and not in the reasoning faculty. If the object perceived lies within the sphere of reason, <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vision of the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> takes place, according to the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> by means of species acquired by the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> but applied by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> himself or illuminated especially by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. If it is not within the range of reason it takes place by the <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> infusion into the mind of new species. It is an open question whether in <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> visions of a superior order the understanding does not perceive Divine things without the aid of species. In this kind of operation the object or fact is perceived as <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and reality, and this with an assurance and <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> far exceeding that which accompanies the most manifest corporeal vision. According to <a href="14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a></p>

<blockquote><p>"We see nothing, either interiorly or exteriorly. . . But without seeing anything the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> conceives the object and feels whence it is more clearly than if it saw it, save that nothing in particular is shown to it. It is like feeling someone near one in a dark place" (first letter to Father Rodrigo Alvarez).</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the sense of the presence, to use the expression of modern writers. And again:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I have rarely beheld the <a href="04764a.htm">Devil</a> in any form, but he has often appeared to me without one, as is the case in <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> visions, when as I have said, the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> clearly perceives someone present, although it does not perceive it in any form" (Life, 31).</p></blockquote>

<p>The vision is sometimes distinct, sometimes indistinct. The former attests the presence of the object without defining any element. "on the feast of the glorious St. Peter," writes <a href="14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a>, "being at <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, I saw, or rather (for I saw nothing, either with the eyes of the body or with those of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>) I felt my Savior near me and I saw that it was he who spoke to me" (Life, 27).</p>

<p>At a certain degree of height or depth, the vision becomes indescribable, inexpressible in human language. <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, rapt to the third <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, was instructed in mysteries which it is not in the power of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> to relate (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs4">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>). There is no occasion, however, to accuse the mystics of <a href="01215c.htm">agnosticism</a>. Their <a href="01215c.htm">agnosticism</a>, if we may so speak, is merely verbal. The inexpressible is not the incomprehensible. Since <a href="05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius Areopagitica</a> mystics have been in the habit of designating the profundity of Divine realities by negative terms. The avowal of the powerlessness of human speech does not prevent them from saying, as did <a href="07639c.htm">St. Ignatius</a>, for example, that what they have seen of the <a href="15047a.htm">Trinity</a> would be sufficient to establish their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, even though the Gospels were to disappear. It is impossible to establish a parallel between the degree of spirituality of the vision and the degree of the mystic state or the <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the subject. Imaginative or even corporeal visions may continue in the most advanced state of union, as seems to have been the case with <a href="14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a>. However, <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> visions of the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>, as of the mystery of the <a href="15047a.htm">Trinity</a>, point indisputably to a very high degree of mystical union.</p>

<h2>Visions of demons</h2>

<p>Since the day when, in the <a href="14519a.htm">terrestrial paradise</a>, the enemy of the <a href="09580c.htm">human race</a> took the form of a serpent in order to tempt our <a href="01129a.htm">first parents</a>, the <a href="04764a.htm">Devil</a> has often shown himself to men in a sensible form. The struggles of <a href="01553d.htm">St. Anthony</a> in the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> against the visible attacks of the enemy are well known (St. <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, Vita S. Antonii) as also in more recent times are the <a href="04764a.htm">Devil's</a> visible attacks on the Cur&eacute; of Ars, <a href="08326c.htm">St. Jean-Baptiste-Marie Vianney</a>. As <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs14">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>) <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a> often transforms himself into an <a href="01476d.htm">angel of light</a> in order to seduce <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. <a href="14332a.htm">Sulpicius Severus</a> has preserved the account of an attempt of this kind made against <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin</a>. One day the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> beheld in his cell, surrounded by a dazzling light, a young man clad in a royal garment, his head encircled by a diadem. <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin</a> was silent in surprise. "Recognize," said the apparition to <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin</a>, "him whom thou seest. I am Christ about to descend upon earth but I wished first to show myself to you." <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin</a> made no reply. "Martin," continued the apparition, "why dost thou hesitate to believe when thou seest? I am Christ." Then said <a href="09732b.htm">Martin:</a> "The <a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a> did not say that he would return in purple and with a crown. I will not recognize my Savior unless I see Him as He suffered, with the <a href="14294b.htm">stigmata</a> and the cross." Then the diabolic phantom vanished, leaving behind an intolerable odor (<em>De Vita Martini</em>). <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> has given an interpretation of this vision for his own period (Martin and Maximus, 206). The best way of judging of the origin of these manifestations is that given by <a href="07639c.htm">St. Ignatius</a>, namely, to examine the series of incidents; to question one's self concerning the beginning, the middle, and the end, will lead to a good result (<em>Spiritual Exercises: Rules for the Discernment of Spirits</em>, 5 a).</p>

<h2>Evocation of the dead and spiritism</h2>

<p>It is written (<a href="../bible/1sa028.htm">1 Samuel 28</a>) that Saul, when defeated by the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, went to the <a href="15674a.htm">witch</a> of Endor and asked her to bring before him the shade of Samuel, and the shade rose out of the earth and revealed to Saul that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> was angry with him because he had spared <a href="01377c.htm">Amalec</a>. Numerous <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> cults practiced evocation of the dead; magicians practiced it in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and in modern times medium or <a href="14221a.htm">spiritists</a> have taken upon themselves the task of communicating with the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead or with disembodied spirits (<em>see</em> <a href="14221a.htm">SPIRITISM</a>). The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has on various occasions condemned the practice of magnetism and <a href="14221a.htm">spiritism</a>, inasmuch as this practice evokes the spirits of the dead and may call <a href="04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> into action. But it has never thereby declared that each operation puts us into real relation with the spirits of the dead or an <a href="04710a.htm">evil spirit</a>. The chief condemnations are those of the Holy Office, 4 August, 1856; 21 April, 1841; 30 March, 1898. [See also Acta Concil. Baltim., II (Col. Lac., III, 406).]</p>
