<p>(From Greek <em>pan</em>, all; <em>theos</em>, god).</p>

<p>The view according to which <a href="06614a.htm">God and the world</a> are one. The name <em>pantheist</em> was introduced by John Toland (1670-1722) in his "Socinianism truly Stated" (1705), while pantheism was first used by his opponent Fay in "Defensio Religionis" (1709). Toland published his "Pantheisticon" in 1732. The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> itself goes back to the early <a href="07722a.htm">Indian</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; it appears during the course of history in a great variety of forms, and it enters into or draws support from so many other systems that, as Professor Flint says ("Antitheistic Theories", 334), "there is probably no pure pantheism". Taken in the strictest sense, i.e. as identifying <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the world, Pantheism is simply <a href="02040a.htm">Atheism</a>. In any of its forms it involves <a href="10483a.htm">Monism</a>, but the latter is not necessarily pantheistic. <a href="05397b.htm">Emanationism</a> may easily take on a pantheistic meaning and as pointed out in the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi dominici gregis", the same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of the modern <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="07682a.htm">immanence</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Varieties</h2>

<p>These agree in the fundamental <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that beneath the apparent diversity and multiplicity of things in the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> there is one only being absolutely <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Two questions then arise: What is the nature of this being? How are the manifold appearances to be explained? The principal answers are incorporated in such different earlier systems as <a href="02730a.htm">Brahminism</a>, <a href="14299a.htm">Stoicism</a>, <a href="10742b.htm">Neo-Platonism</a>, and <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, and in the later systems of <a href="05519a.htm">Scotus Eriugena</a> and <a href="03016a.htm">Giordano Bruno</a>.</p>

<p><a href="14217a.htm">Spinoza's</a> pantheism was realistic: the one being of the world had an objective character. But the systems that developed during the nineteenth century went to the extreme of <a href="07634a.htm">idealism</a>. They are properly grouped under the designation of "transcendental pantheism", as their starting-point is found in <a href="08603a.htm">Kant's</a> critical <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> had distinguished in <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the matter which comes through sensation from the outer world, and the forms, which are purely subjective and yet are the more important factors. Furthermore, he had declared that we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the appearances (<em>phenomena</em>) of things but not the things-in-themselves (<em>noumena</em>). And he had made the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, the world, and <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> merely <a href="07682a.htm">immanent</a>, so that any attempt to demonstrate their objective value must end in contradiction. This subjectivism paved the way for the pantheistic theories of Fichte, Schelling, and <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel</a>.</p>

<p>Fichte set back into the mind all the elements of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, i.e. matter as well as form; phenomena and indeed the whole of reality are products of the thinking Ego-not the individual mind but the absolute or universal self-consciousness. Through the three-fold process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, the Ego posits the non-Ego not only theoretically but also for practical purposes, i.e. for effort and struggle which are <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to attain the <a href="06640a.htm">highest good</a>. In the same way the Ego, free in itself, posits other free agents by whose existence its own freedom is limited. Hence the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of right and all morality; but hence also the Divine being. The living, active moral order of the world, says Fichte, is itself <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, we need no other <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and can conceive of no other. The <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> as a distinct substance is impossible and contradictory. Such, at any rate, is the earlier form of his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, though in his later theorizing he emphasizes more and more the concepts of the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a> as embracing all <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> within itself.</p>

<p>According to Schelling, the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a> is the "identity of all differences"-object and subject, nature and mind, the real order and the ideal; and the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this identity is obtained by an <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> which, abstracting from every individual thinker and every possible object of thought, contemplates the absolute reason. Out of this original unity all things evolve in opposite directions: nature as the negative pole, mind or spirit as the positive pole of a vast magnet, the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>. Within this totality each thing, like the particle of a magnet, has its nature or form determined according as it manifests subjectivity or objectivity in greater degree. History is but the gradual self-revelation of the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a>; when its final period will come to pass we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> not; but when it does come, then <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> will be.</p>

<p>The system of <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel</a> has been called "logical pantheism", as it is constructed on the "dialectical" method; and "panlogismus", since it describes the entire world-process as the evolution of the Idea. Starting from the most abstract of notions, i.e. pure being, the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a> develops first the various categories; then it externalizes itself, and Nature is the result; finally it returns upon itself, regains unity and self-consciousness, becomes the individual spirit of man. The <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a>, therefore, is Mind; but it attains its fulness only by a process of evolution or "becoming", the stages of which form the history of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>These idealistic constructions were followed by a reaction due largely to the development of the natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>. But these in turn offer, apparently, new support to the central positions of pantheism, or at any rate they point, it is claimed, to that very unity and that gradual unfolding which pantheism has all along asserted. The <a href="05422a.htm">principle of the conservation of energy</a> through ceaseless transformations, and the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of evolution applied to all things and all phenomena, are readily interpreted by the pantheist in favour of his own system. Even where the ultimate reality is said to be unknowable as in Herbert Spencer's "Synthetic Philosophy", it is still one and the same being that manifests itself alike in evolving matter and in the consciousness that evolves out of lower material forms. Nor is it surprising that some writers should see in pantheism the final outcome of all speculation and the definitive expression which the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> has found for the totality of things.</p>

<p>This statement, in fact, may well serve as a summary of the pantheistic <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Reality is a unitary being; individual things have no absolute independence- they have existence in the All-One, the <em>ens realissimum et et perfectissimum</em> of which they are the more or less independent members;</li><li>The All-One manifests itself to us, so far as it has any manifestations, in the two sides of reality-nature and history;</li><li>The universal interaction that goes on in the physical world is the showing forth of the inner &aelig;sthetic teleological <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> with which the All-One unfolds his essential being in a multitude of harmonious modifications, a cosmos of concrete <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> (monads, entelechies). This internal <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> is at the same time absolute freedom or self-realization.</li></ul></div>

<h2>Catholic doctrine</h2>

<p>The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has repeatedly condemned the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of pantheism. Among the propositions censured in the Syllabus of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> is that which declares: "There is no supreme, all-wise and all-provident Divine Being distinct from the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>; <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is one with nature and therefore subject to change; He becomes <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in man and the world; all things are <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and have His substance; <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is identical with the world, spirit with matter, <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> with freedom, <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> with <a href="05781a.htm">falsity</a>, good with <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> with <a href="08010c.htm">injustice</a>" (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Ench.", 1701). And the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> <a href="01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> those who assert that the substance or essence of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and of all things is one and the same, or that all things evolve from <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> essence (ibid., 1803 sqq.).</p>

<h2>Criticism</h2>

<p>To our perception the world presents a multitude of beings each of which has qualities activities, and existence of its own, each is an individual thing. Radical differences mark off living things from those that are lifeless; the conscious from the unconscious human thought and volition from the activities of lower animals. And among <a href="09580c.htm">human beings</a> each <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> appears as a self, which cannot by any effort become completely one with other selves. On the other hand, any adequate account of the world other than downright materialism includes the concept of some original Being which, whether it be called First Cause, or Absolute, or <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, is in its nature and existence really distinct from the world. Only such a Being can satisfy the demands of human thought, either as the source of the moral order or as the object of religious worship. If, then, pantheism not only merges the separate existences of the world in one existence, but also identifies this one with the Divine Being, some cogent reason or motive must be alleged in justification of such a procedure. Pantheists indeed bring forward various arguments in support of their several positions, and in reply to criticism aimed at the details of their system; but what lies back of their reasoning and what has prompted the construction of all pantheistic theories, both old and new, is the craving for unity. The mind, they insist, cannot accept <a href="05169a.htm">dualism</a> or pluralism as the final account of reality. By an irresistible tendency, it seeks to substitute for the apparent multiplicity and diversity of things a unitary ground or source, and, once this is determined, to explain all things as somehow derived though not really separated from it.</p>

<p>That such is in fact the ideal of many <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> cannot be denied; nor is it needful to challenge the statement that reason does aim at unification on some basis or other. But this very aim and all endeavours in view of it must likewise be kept within reasonable bounds: a theoretical unity obtained at too great a sacrifice is no unity at all, but merely an abstraction that quickly falls to pieces. Hence for an estimate of pantheism two questions must be considered:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>at what cost does it identify <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the world; and</li><li>is the identification really accomplished or only attempted?</li></ul></div>

<p>The answer to the first is furnished by a review of the leading concepts which enter into the pantheistic system.</p>

<h3>God</h3>

<p>It has often been claimed that pantheism by teaching us to see <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in everything gives us an exalted <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of His wisdom, <a href="06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and power, while it imparts to the visible world a deeper meaning. In point of fact, however, it makes void the attributes which belong essentially to the Divine nature For the pantheist <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not a personal Being. He is not an intelligent Cause of the world, designing, creating and governing it in accordance with the free determination of His wisdom. If consciousness is ascribed to Him as the one Substance, extension is also said to be His attribute (<a href="14217a.htm">Spinoza</a>), or He attains to self-consciousness only through a process of evolution (<a href="07192a.htm">Hegel</a>). But this very process implies that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not from <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> perfect: He is forever changing, advancing from one degree of perfection to another, and helpless to determine in what direction the advance shall take place. Indeed, there is no warrant for saying that He "advances" or becomes more "perfect"; at most we can say that He, or rather It, is constantly passing into other forms. Thus <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not only impersonal, but also changeable and finite-which is equivalent to saying that He is not <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that some pantheists, such as Paulsen, while frankly denying the <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, pretend to exalt His being by asserting that He is "supra-personal." If this means that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in Himself is <a href="08004a.htm">infinitely</a> beyond any <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that we can form of Him, the statement is correct; but if it means that our <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of Him is radically <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> and not merely inadequate, that consequently we have no <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to speak of <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> intelligence and will, the statement is simply a makeshift which pantheism borrows from <a href="01215c.htm">agnosticism</a> Even then the term "supra-personal" is not consistently applied to what Paulsen calls the All-One; for this, if at all related to <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>, should be described as infra-personal.</p>

<p>Once the Divine <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> is removed, it is evidently a misnomer to speak of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> as just or holy, or in any sense a moral Being. Since <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, in the pantheistic view, acts out of sheer <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a>--that is, cannot act otherwise--His action is no more good than it is <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>. To say, with Fichte, that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is the moral order, is an open contradiction; no such order exists where nothing is free, nor could <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, a non-moral Being, have established a moral order either for Himself or for other beings. If, on the other hand, it be maintained that the moral order does exist, that it is postulated by our human judgments, the plight of pantheism is no better; for in that case all the actions of men, their crimes as well as their good deeds, must be imputed to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus the Divine Being not only loses the attribute of absolute <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>, but even falls below the level of those men in whom moral <a href="06636b.htm">goodness</a> triumphs over <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h3>Man</h3>

<p>No such claim, however, can be made in behalf of the moral order by a consistent pantheist. For him, human <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> is a mere illusion: what we call the individual man is only one of the countless fragments that make up the Divine Being; and since the All is impersonal no single part of it can validly claim <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>. Futhermore, since each human action is inevitably determined, the consciousness of freedom is simply another illusion, due, as <a href="14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> says, to our <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the causes that compel us to act. Hence our <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of what "ought to be" are purely subjective, and our concept of a moral order, with its distinctions of right and wrong, has no foundation in reality. The so-called "dictates of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>" are doubtless interesting phenomena of mind which the <a href="12545b.htm">psychologist</a> may investigate and explain, but they have no binding force whatever; they are just as illusory as the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of virtue and <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, of <a href="08010c.htm">injustice</a> to the fellow-man and of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> against <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. But again, since these dictates, like all our <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, are produced in us by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that He is the source of our illusions regarding morality &#151; a consequence which certainly does not enhance His <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> or His <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>It is not, however, clear that the term illusion is justified; for this supposes a distinction between <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and error-a distinction which has no meaning for the genuine pantheist; all our judgments being the utterance of the One that thinks in us, it is impossible to discriminate the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> from the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>. He who rejects pantheism is no further from the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> than he who defends it; each but expresses a thought of the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a> whose large tolerance harbours all contradictions. <a href="09324a.htm">Logically</a>, too, it would follow that no heed should be taken as to <a href="15073a.htm">veracity</a> of statement, since all statements are equally warranted. The pantheist who is careful to speak in accordance with his thought simply refrains from putting his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> into practice. But it is none the less significant that <a href="14217a.htm">Spinoza's</a> chief work was his "Ethics", and that, according to one modern view, ethics has only to describe what men do, not to prescribe what they ought to do.</p>

<h3>Religion</h3>

<p>In forming its conception of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, pantheism eliminates every characteristic that religion presupposes. An impersonal being, whatever attributes it may have, cannot be an object of worship. An <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> substance or a self-evolving energy may excite fear but it repels <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. Even the beneficent forms of its manifestation call forth no gratitude, since these result from it by a rigorous <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a>. For the same reason, <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> of any sort is useless, atonement is vain and merit impossible. The <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> of course disappears entirely when <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the world are identified.</p>

<p>Recent advocates of pantheism have sought to obviate these difficulties and to show that, apart from particular <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> and spirit are safeguarded in their theory. But in this attempt they divest religion of its essentials, reducing it to mere feeling. Not action, they allege, but <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> and trustfulness constitute religion. This, however is an arbitrary procedure; by the same method it could be shown that religion is nothing more than existing or breathing. The pantheist quite overlooks the fact that religion means obedience to <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>; and of this obedience there can be no question in a system which denies the freedom of man's will. According to pantheism there is just as little "rational service" in the so-called <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> as there is in the behaviour of any physical agent. And if men still distinguish between actions that are religious and those that are not, the distinction is but another illusion.</p>

<h3>Immortality</h3>

<p>Belief in a future life is not only an incentive to effort and a source of encouragement; for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> at least it implies a sanction of <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, a prospect of retribution. But this sanction is of no meaning or efficacy unless the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> survive as an individual. If, as pantheism teaches, <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a> is absorption into the being of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, it can matter little what sort of life one leads here. There is no ground for discriminating between the lot of the righteous and that of the wicked, when all alike are merged in the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a>. And if by some further process of evolution such a discrimination should come to pass, it can signify nothing, either as reward or as punishment, once personal consciousness has ceased. That perfect union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> which pantheism seems to promise, is no powerful inspiration to right living when one considers how far from holy must be a <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> who continually takes up into Himself the worst of humanity along with the best--if indeed one may continue to think in terms that involve a distinction between <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> and good.</p>

<p>It is therefore quite plain that in endeavouring to unify all things, pantheism <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> too much. If <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, freedom, morality and religion must all be reduced to the One and its inevitable processes, there arises the question whether the craving for unity may not be the source of illusions more fatal than any of those which pantheism claims to dispel. But in fact no such unification is attained. The pantheist uses his power of abstraction to set aside all differences, and then declares that the differences are not really there. Yet even for him they <em>seem</em> to be there, and so from the very outset he is dealing with appearance and reality; and these two he never fuses into one. He simply hurries on to assert that the reality is Divine and that all the apparent things are manifestations of the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>, but he does not explain why each manifestation should be finite or why the various manifestations should be interpreted in so many different and conflicting ways by human minds, each of which is a part of one and the same <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. He makes the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a> pass onward from unconsciousness to consciousness but does not show why there should be these two stages in evolution, or why evolution, which certainly means becoming "other", should take place at all.</p>

<p>It might be noted, too, that pantheism fails to unify subject and object, and that in spite of its efforts the world of existence remains distinct from the world of thought. But such objections have little weight with the thorough-going pantheist who follows <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, and is willing for the sake of "unity" to declare that Being and Nothing are identical.</p>

<p>There is nevertheless a fundamental unity which <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> has always recognized, and which has <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for its centre. Not as the universal being, nor as the formal constituent principle of things, but as their efficient cause operating in and through each, and as the final cause for which things exist, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in a very <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> sense is the source of all thought and reality (see <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Contra Gentes", I). His omnipresence and action, far from eliminating secondary causes, preserve each in the natural order of its efficiency-physical agents under the determination of physical law and human <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> in the exercise of intelligence and freedom. the foundation of the moral order. The straining after unity in the pantheistic sense is without warrant, the only intelligible unity is that which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> himself has established, a unity of purpose which is manifest alike in the processes of the <a href="15183a.htm">material universe</a> and in the free volition of man, and which moves on to its fulfilment in the union of the created spirit with the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> Person, the author of the moral order and the object of religious worship.</p>
