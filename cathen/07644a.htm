<h1>St. Ignatius of Antioch</h1>

<p>Also called Theophorus (<em>ho Theophoros</em>); born in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, around the year 50; died at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> between 98 and 117.</p>

<p>More than one of the earliest <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers have given credence, though apparently without good reason, to the legend that Ignatius was the child whom the <a href="08374c.htm">Savior</a> took up in His arms, as described in <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs35">Mark 9:35</a>. It is also believed, and with great probability, that, with his friend <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, he was among the auditors of the Apostle St. John. If we include St. Peter, Ignatius was the third <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and the immediate successor of <a href="05653a.htm">Evodius</a> (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250102.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.3.22</a>). Theodoret ("Dial. Immutab.", I, iv, 33a, Paris, 1642) is the authority for the statement that St. Peter appointed Ignatius to the See of Antioch. <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> lays special emphasis on the honor conferred upon the <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> in receiving his episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> at the hands of the Apostles themselves ("Hom. in St. Ig.", IV. 587). Natalis Alexander quotes Theodoret to the same effect (III, xii, art. xvi, p. 53).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>All the sterling qualities of ideal <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> soldier of Christ were possessed by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in a preeminent degree. Accordingly, when the storm of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="05114b.htm">Domitian</a> broke in its full fury upon the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, it found their faithful leader prepared and watchful. He was unremitting in his vigilance and tireless in his efforts to inspire hope and to strengthen the weaklings of his flock against the terrors of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The restoration of peace, though it was short-lived, greatly comforted him. But it was not for himself that he rejoiced, as the one great and ever-present wish of his <a href="03691a.htm">chivalrous</a> <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> was that he might receive the fullness of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05029a.htm">discipleship</a> through the medium of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. His desire was not to remain long unsatisfied. Associated with the writings of St. Ignatius is a work called "Martyrium Ignatii", which purports to be an account by eyewitnesses of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Ignatius and the acts leading up to it. In this work, which such competent <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics as Pearson and Ussher regard as genuine, the full history of that eventful journey from <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> is faithfully recorded for the edification of the <a href="01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>. It is certainly very ancient and is reputed to have been written by <a href="12023a.htm">Philo</a>, <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, and Rheus Agathopus, a <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, who accompanied Ignatius to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It is generally admitted, even by those who regarded it as authentic, that this work has been greatly interpolated. Its most reliable form is that found in the "Martyrium Colbertinum" which closes the mixed recension and is so called because its oldest witness is the tenth-century Codex Colbertinus (Paris).</p>

<p>According to these Acts, in the ninth year of his reign, <a href="15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, flushed with victory over the Scythians and Dacians, sought to perfect the universality of his dominion by a species of religious conquest. He decreed, therefore, that the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> should unite with their <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> neighbors in the worship of the gods. A general <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> was threatened, and death was named as the penalty for all who refused to offer the prescribed sacrifice. Instantly alert to the danger that threatened, Ignatius availed himself of all the means within his reach to thwart the purpose of the emperor. The success of his <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> efforts did not long remain hidden from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecutors</a>. He was soon arrested and led before <a href="15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, who was then sojourning in <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Accused by the emperor himself of violating the imperial edict, and of inciting others to like transgressions, Ignatius valiantly bore witness to the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If we may believe the account given in the "Martyrium", his bearing before <a href="15015a.htm">Trajan</a> was characterized by inspired eloquence, sublime <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, and even a spirit of exultation. Incapable of appreciating the motives that animated him, the emperor ordered him to be put in chains and taken to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, there to become the food of wild beasts and a spectacle for the people.</p>

<p>That the trials of this journey to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> were great we gather from his letter to the Romans (par. 5): "From <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> even to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> I fight with wild beasts, by land and sea, by night and by day, being bound amidst ten leopards, even a company of soldiers, who only grow worse when they are kindly treated." Despite all this, his journey was a kind of triumph. News of his fate, his destination, and his probable itinerary had gone swiftly before. At several places along the road his fellow-Christians greeted him with words of comfort and reverential homage. It is probable that he embarked on his way to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> at <a href="13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, the nearest port to <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, for either Tarsus in Cilicia, or Attalia in Pamphylia, and thence, as we gather from his letters, he journeyed overland through <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. At Laodicea, on the River Lycus, where a choice of routes presented itself, his guards selected the more northerly, which brought the prospective <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> through Philadelphia and Sardis, and finally to <a href="14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, where <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, his fellow-disciple in the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of St. John, was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The stay at <a href="14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, which was a protracted one, gave the representatives of the various <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities in <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> an opportunity of greeting the illustrious <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and offering him the homage of the Churches they represented. From the congregations of Ephesus, <a href="09533a.htm">Magnesia</a>, and Tralles, deputations came to comfort him. To each of these <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities he addressed letters from <a href="14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, exhorting them to obedience to their respective <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and warning them to avoid the contamination of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. These, letters are redolent with the spirit of <a href="03592a.htm">Christian charity</a>, <a href="15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, and pastoral solicitude. While still there he wrote also to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, begging them to do nothing to deprive him of the opportunity of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From Smyrna his captors took him to <a href="15063c.htm">Troas</a>, from which place he dispatched letters to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Philadelphia and Smyrna, and to <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>. Besides these letters, Ignatius had intended to address others to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities of <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, inviting them to give public expression to their sympathy with the brethren in <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, but the altered plans of his guards, necessitating a hurried departure, from <a href="15063c.htm">Troas</a>, defeated his purpose, and he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to content himself with delegating this office to his friend <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>. At Troas they took ship for Neapolis. From this place their journey led them overland through <a href="12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> and <a href="07663a.htm">Illyria</a>. The next port of embarkation was probably Dyrrhachium (Durazzo). Whether having arrived at the shores of the Adriatic, he completed his journey by land or sea, it is impossible to determine. Not long after his arrival in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he won his long-coveted crown of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the <a href="04101b.htm">Flavian amphitheater</a>. The <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> were borne back to Antioch by the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> Philo of Cilicia, and Rheus Agathopus, a <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, and were <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> outside the gates not far from the beautiful suburb of Daphne. They were afterwards removed by the Emperor Theodosius II to the Tychaeum, or Temple of Fortune which was then converted into a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> church under the patronage of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> whose <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> it sheltered. In 637 they were translated to St. Clement's at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where they now rest. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates the feast of St. Ignatius on 1 February.</p>

<p>The character of St. Ignatius, as <a href="04674a.htm">deduced</a> from his own and the extant writings of his contemporaries, is that of a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> athlete of Christ. The triple honor of apostle, <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> was well merited by this energetic soldier of the Faith. An enthusiastic devotion to <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, a passionate <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of sacrifice, and an utter fearlessness in the defense of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, were his chief characteristics. Zeal for the spiritual well-being of those under his charge breathes from every line of his writings. Ever vigilant lest they be infected by the rampant <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> of those early days; <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> for them, that their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> may not be wanting in the hour of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>; constantly exhorting them to unfailing obedience to their <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; teaching them all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>; eagerly sighing for the crown of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, that his own blood may fructify in added <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> in the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of his flock, he proves himself in every sense a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, the good shepherd that lays down his life for his sheep.</p>

<h2>Collections</h2>

<p>The oldest collection of the writings of St. Ignatius known to have existed was that made use of by the historian <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> in the first half of the fourth century, but which unfortunately is no longer extant. It was made up of the seven letters written by Ignatius whilst on his way to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; These letters were addressed to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a></p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>of Ephesus (<em>Pros Ephesious</em>);</li><li>of <a href="09533a.htm">Magnesia</a> (<em>Magnesieusin</em>);</li><li>of <a href="15016c.htm">Tralles</a> (<em>Trallianois</em>);</li><li>of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (<em>Pros Romaious</em>);</li><li>of Philadelphia (<em>Philadelpheusin</em>);</li><li>of <a href="14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> (<em>Smyrnaiois</em>); and</li><li>to Polycarp (<em>Pros Polykarpon</em>).</li></ul></div>

<p>We find these seven mentioned not only by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.36</a>) but also by <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (De viris illust., c. xvi). Of later collections of Ignatian letters which have been preserved, the oldest is known as the "long recension". This collection, the author of which is unknown, dates from the latter part of the fourth century. It contains the seven genuine and six spurious letters, but even the genuine epistles were greatly interpolated to lend weight to the personal views of its author. For this reason they are incapable of bearing witness to the original form. The spurious letters in this recension are those that purport to be from Ignatius</p>

<p>It is extremely probable that the interpolation of the genuine, the addition of the spurious letters, and the union of both in the long recension was the work of an <a href="01615b.htm">Apollinarist</a> of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> or <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who wrote towards the beginning of the fifth century. Funk identifies him with the compiler of the Apostolic Constitutions, which came out of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> in the early part of the same century. Subsequently there was added to this collection a panegyric on St. Ignatius entitled, "Laus Heronis". Though in the original it was probably written in Greek, it is now extant only in Latin and Coptic texts. There is also a third recension, designated by Funk as the "mixed collection". The time of its origin can be only vaguely determined as being between that of the collection known to <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and the long recension. Besides the seven genuine letters of Ignatius in their original form, it also contains the six spurious ones, with the exception of that to the Philippians.</p>

<p>In this collection is also to be found the "Martyrium Colbertinum". The Greek original of this recension is contained in a single codex, the famous Mediceo-Laurentianus <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at Florence. This codex is incomplete, wanting the letter to the Romans, which, however, is to be found associated with the "Martyrium Colbertinum" in the Codex Colbertinus, at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The mixed collection is regarded as the most reliable of all in determining what was the authentic text of the genuine Ignatian letters. There is also an ancient Latin version which is an unusually exact rendering of the Greek. Critics are generally inclined to look upon this version as a translation of some Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the same type as that of the Medicean Codex. This version owes its discovery to Archbishop Ussher, of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, who found it in two <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a> and published it in 1644. It was the work of <a href="07037a.htm">Robert Grosseteste</a>, a <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friar</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln (c. 1250). The original Syriac version has come down to us in its entirety only in an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> translation. It also contains the seven genuine and six spurious letters. This collection in the original Syriac would be invaluable in determining the exact text of Ignatius, were it in existence, for the reason that it could not have been later than the fourth or fifth century. The deficiencies of the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> version are in part supplied by the abridged recension in the original Syriac. This abridgment contains the three genuine letters to the Ephesians, the Romans, and to Polycarp. The <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was discovered by Cureton in a collection of Syriac <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> obtained in 1843 from the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Mary Deipara in the Desert of Nitria. Also there are three letters extant only in Latin. Two of the three purport to be from Ignatius to <a href="08492a.htm">St. John the Apostle</a>, and one to the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, with her reply to the same. These are probably of Western origin, dating no further back than the twelfth century.</p>

<h2>The controversy</h2>

<p>At intervals during the last several centuries a warm controversy has been carried on by patrologists concerning the authenticity of the Ignatian letters. Each particular recension has had its apologists and its opponents. Each has been favored to the exclusion of all the others, and all, in turn, have been collectively rejected, especially by the coreligionists of <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. The reformer himself, in language as violent as it is uncritical (Institutes, 1-3), repudiates <em>in globo</em> the letters which so completely discredit his own peculiar views on <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government. The convincing evidence which the letters bear to the Divine origin of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> is not conducive to predisposing non-Catholic critics in their favor, in fact, it has added not a little to the heat of the controversy. In general, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> scholars are ranged on the side of the letters written to the Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians, <a href="../fathers/0109.htm">Smyrniots</a>, and to Polycarp; whilst <a href="12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a>, as a rule, and perhaps a priori, repudiate everything claiming Ignatian authorship.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The two letters to the Apostle St. John and the one to the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, which exist only in Latin, are unanimously admitted to be spurious. The great body of critics who acknowledge the authenticity of the Ignatian letters restrict their approval to those mentioned by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. The six others are not defended by any of the early Fathers. The majority of those who acknowledge the Ignatian authorship of the seven letters do so conditionally, rejecting what they consider the obvious interpolations in these letters. In 1623, whilst the controversy was at its height, Vedelius gave expression to this latter opinion by publishing at <a href="09040a.htm">Geneva</a> an edition of the Ignatian letters in which the seven genuine letters are set apart from the five spurious. In the genuine letters he indicated what was regarded as interpolations. The reformer Dallaeus, at <a href="09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, in 1666, published a work entitled "De scriptis quae sub Dionysii Areop. et Ignatii Antioch. nominibus circumferuntur", in which (lib. II) he called into question the authenticity of all seven letters. To this the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Pearson replied spiritedly in a work called "Vindiciae epistolarum S. Ignatii", published at <a href="03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, 1672. So convincing were the arguments adduced in this scholarly work that for two hundred years the controversy remained closed in favor of the genuineness of the seven letters. The discussion was reopened by Cureton's discovery (1843) of the abridged Syriac version, containing the letters of Ignatius to the Ephesians, Romans, and to Polycarp. In a work entitled "Vindiciae Ignatianae" London, 1846), he defended the position that only the letters contained in his abridged Syriac recension, and in the form therein contained, were genuine, and that all others were interpolated or forged outright. This position was vigorously combated by several British and German critics, including the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a> and Hefele, who successfully defended the genuineness of the entire seven epistles. It is now generally admitted that Cureton's Syriac version is only an abbreviation of the original.</p>

<p>While it can hardly be said that there is at present any unanimous agreement on the subject, the best modern criticism favors the authenticity of the seven letters mentioned by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. Even such eminent non-Catholic critics as Zahn, Lightfoot, and Harnack hold this view. Perhaps the best evidence of their authenticity is to be found in the letter of Polycarp to the Philippians, which mentions each of them by name. As an intimate friend of Ignatius, <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, writing shortly after the <a href="09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death, bears contemporaneous witness to the authenticity of these letters, unless, indeed, that of Polycarp itself be regarded as interpolated or forged. When, furthermore, we take into consideration the passage of <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (Adv. Haer., V, xxviii, 4) found in the original Greek in <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.36</a>), in which he refers to the letter to the Romans. (iv, I) in the following words: "Just as one of our brethren said, condemned to the wild beasts in martyrdom for his faith", the evidence of authenticity becomes compelling. The romance of Lucian of <a href="13422a.htm">Samosata</a>, "De morte peregrini", written in 167, bears incontestable evidence that the writer was not only familiar with the Ignatian letters, but even made use of them. Harnack, who was not always so minded, describes these <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> as "testimony as strong to the genuineness of the epistles as any that can be conceived of" (Expositor, ser. 3, III, p. 11).</p>

<h2>Contents of the letters</h2>

<p>It is scarcely possible to exaggerate the importance of the testimony which the Ignatian letters offer to the <a href="05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> character of Apostolic <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> constitutes a most important link between the Apostles and the Fathers of the early <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Receiving from the Apostles themselves, whose auditor he was, not only the substance of <a href="13001a.htm">revelation</a>, but also their own inspired interpretation of it; dwelling, as it were, at the very fountain-head of Gospel <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, his testimony must necessarily carry with it the greatest weight and demand the most serious consideration. <a href="10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> did not exaggerate the matter when he said ("The Theology of the Seven Epistles of St. Ignatius", in "Historical Sketches", I, London, 1890) that "the whole system of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> may be discovered, at least in outline, not to say in parts filled up, in the course of his seven epistles". Among the many <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a> to be found in the letters are the following:</p>

<p>He, moreover, denounces in principle the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of private judgment in matters of religion (<a href="../fathers/0108.htm"><em>Philadelphians</em> 3</a>), The <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> against which he chiefly inveighs is <a href="05070c.htm">Docetism</a>. Neither do the Judaizing <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> escape his vigorous condemnation.</p>

<h2>Editions</h2>

<p>The four letters found in Latin only were printed in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1495. The common Latin version of eleven letters, together with a letter of Polycarp and some reputed works of <a href="05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, was printed in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1498, by <a href="09114b.htm">Lef&egrave;vre d'Etaples</a>. Another edition of the seven genuine and six spurious letters, including the one to Mary of Cassobola, was edited by Symphorianus Champerius, of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Paris, 1516. Valentinus Paceus published a Greek edition of twelve letters (Dillingen, 1557). A similar edition was brought out at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, in 1559, by Andrew Gesner; a Latin version of the work of John Brunner accompanied it. Both of these editions made use of the Greek text of the long recension. In 1644 Archbishop Ussher edited the letters of Ignatius and <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>. The common Latin version, with three of the four Latin letters, was subjoined. It also contained the Latin version of eleven letters taken from Ussher's <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In 1646 Isaac Voss published at <a href="01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a> an edition from the famous Medicean Codex at Florence. Ussher brought out another edition in 1647, entitled "Appendix Ignatiana", which contained the Greek text of the genuine epistles and the Latin version of the "Martyrium Ignatii".</p>

<p>In 1672 J.B. Cotelier's edition appeared at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, containing all the letters, genuine and supposititious, of Ignatius, with those of the other <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>. A new edition of this work was printed by Le Clerc at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, in 1698. It was reprinted at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1765-1767, and at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> by <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a> in 1857. The letter to the Romans was published from the "Martyrium Colbertinum" at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, by Ruinart, in 1689. In 1724 Le Clerc brought out at <a href="01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a> a second edition of Cotelier's "Patres Apostolici", which contains all the letters, both genuine and spurious, in Greek and Latin versions. It also includes the letters of Mary of Cassobola and those purporting to be from the Blessed Virgin in the "Martyrium Ignatii", the "Vindiciae Ignatianae" of Pearson, and several dissertations. The first edition of the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> version was published at Constantinople in 1783. In 1839 Hefele edited the Ignatian letters in a work entitled "Opera Patrum Apostolicorum", which appeared at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>. <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a> took his text from the third edition of this work (T&uuml;bingen, 1847). Bardenhewer designates the following as the best editions: Zahn, "Ignatii et Polycarpi epistulae martyria, fragmenta" in "Patr. apostol. opp. rec.", ed. by de Gebhardt, Harnack, Zahn, fasc. II, Leipzig, 1876; Funk, "Opp. Patr. apostol.", I, T&uuml;bingen, 1878, 1887, 1901; Lightfoot, "The Apostolic Fathers", part II, London, 1885, 1889; an English version of the letters to be found in Lightfoot's "Apostolic Fathers", London, 1907, from which are taken all the quotations of the letters in this article, and to which all citations refer.</p>
