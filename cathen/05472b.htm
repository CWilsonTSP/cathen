<h2 id="section1">Foundation</h2>

<p>Some historians (e.g., <a href="14779b.htm">Dodd</a>, II, 168, following <a href="15353c.htm">Polydore Vergil</a>, Harpsfield, Spelman, etc.) have traced the origin of the English College back to the Saxon <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> founded in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Ina, King of the West Saxons, in 727. To an antiquity so great, however, the college, venerable though it be, has no just claim. It dates from about the middle of the fourteenth century, when the Hospice of <a href="14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a> was founded. This hospice owed its establishment to the jubilees, which brought <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the Holy City from every country of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Those who arrived from <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1350 to perform their devotions, found it difficult to obtain suitable accommodation. This suggested an institution, national in character, where English <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> might receive shelter and hospitality. The archives of the English College seem to point to the establishment of a guild of <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>, which acquired certain <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> on the Via Monserrato, the principle <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who took part in the transaction being John Shepherd and Alice his wife, who devoted themselves to the service of the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> in the hospice, and William Chandler, chamberlain, Robert de Pines, syndic, and John Williams, officials of the community and <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of the English in the city. The deeds show that the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> in question was acquired in the year 1362, which therefore may be taken as the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the foundation of the hospice. But from the time of Henry VII the hospice began to decline, After the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> had broken out anew under Elizabeth, many of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> went into exile. Some of those who found their way to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> were received into the hospice, and formed a permanent community therein. During Dr. William Allen's visit to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1576, it was arranged with <a href="07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> that a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> should be founded there for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the English mission. As soon as he returned to <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> (30 July, 1576) he sent ten students to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to form the nucleus of the new college; six more went in 1577, and again six in 1578. <a href="09727a.htm">Dr. Gregory Martin</a>, writing on 26 May, 1578, to <a href="05293c.htm">Father Campion</a>, tells him that twenty-six students are living either in the hospice itself or in the house next door, which has internal communication with the hospice (Douai Diaries, Appendix, p. 316). Indeed, the Pope had already determined to convert the hospice into a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and at <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1578, "there came out a <em>Breve</em> from the Popes Holines commanding all the ould Chaplines to depart within 15 dayes, and assigning all the rents of the Hospitall unto the use of the Seminary, which was presently obayed by the said Priests" (Father Person's Memoirs: <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Record Society, II, 144). Unfortunately, however, <a href="10575a.htm">Cardinal Morone</a>, the <a href="03341a.htm">Protector</a> of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and also therefore of the College, appointed as its <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> <a href="04048a.htm">Dr. Clenock</a>, the warden of the hospice, who was assisted by two <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> as prefect of Studies and <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a>. <a href="09727a.htm">Dr. Gregory Martin</a>, again writing to <a href="05293c.htm">Father Campion</a>, 18 Feb, 1579 (from <a href="12725a.htm">Rheims</a>) informs him that there are in the college at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, "at the present moment forty-two of our students, most of whom are divines, one <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, three Fathers of your <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, and six servants. They live in the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and in the adjoining house. The revenues of the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> have been transferred to the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, except what is required for the entertainment of the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>" (Douai Diaries, lviii, and Appendix, p. 319). However, internal dissensions soon arose. Most of the students of the college were, of course, English; but there were also seven or eight Welshmen, for no national distinction was made between the Cambrian and the Saxon, all being considered as English for the purposes of the institution. The <a href="15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> was accused of favoring his fellow countrymen; and finally the English students broke out in open mutiny. They petitioned the Holy Father that the college should be entrusted to the <a href="14081a.htm">Fathers of the Society of Jesus</a>, and declared that they would rather leave the college than remain under <a href="04048a.htm">Dr. Clenock</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The students were ordered by the <a href="03341a.htm">Cardinal Protector</a> to submit under pain of expulsion; but they preferred to go, and began to make preparations for the journey back to <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> and <a href="12725a.htm">Rheims</a>, or to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Much sympathy, however, was a shown for them in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, intercession being made with the Pope on their behalf, they were reinstated in the college after two days, and their petition was granted. <a href="04048a.htm">Dr. Clenock</a> was removed from the rectorship, and the college handed over to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the famous <a href="11729a.htm">Father Robert Persons</a> being given temporary charge till the appointment of the first permanent <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, Father Alphonsus Agazzari, on 23 April, 1579. This day is the real birth day of the English College in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; for on this day the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Foundation was signed by <a href="07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a>; on this day the students took an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to lead an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, and proceed to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> when it should seem good to their superiors; and on this day the College Register begins. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, however, was not published till 23 Dec., 1580. Under this date, the entry occurs in the <em>College Annals</em> (<em>Liber Ruber</em>) II, 12; of which the following is the translation: "A.D. 1580, on the 23rd of December, to the praise and glory of the <a href="15047a.htm">Most Holy Trinity</a> and of St. Thomas the <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>, was expedited the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of the Foundation of this College, which, though it was granted by <a href="07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> in April of last year, did not reach our hands before the above date, and in which, as besides many faculties and spiritual and temporal favours, all the goods of the English Hospice were united with the College, we received possession of them on 29th. Dec., which is dedicated to St. Thomas the Martyr; and although it does not explicitly appear in the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, yet the Pope declared by word of mouth that this college is bound to receive and maintain the English <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> according to the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the sia Hospice. This <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> has been deposited in the College Archives."</p>

<p>Thus the English College, the oldest but two of all the national colleges of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (the German College and the Greek College), was launched on its career, the number of students at the time in the college being fifty, a number which later rose to seventy-five. That the college did its work efficiently, and fulfilled the purpose for which it was founded, is abundantly attested by the list of names of the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> sent into the mission field, and especially by the roll of its <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. During the period 1682-1694, under the <a href="03341a.htm">Cardinal Protector Howard, O.P.</a>, the greater part of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was rebuilt.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century was a period of decline. Contrary to the original constitutions of the college. boys were admitted for the course of humanities, and some, of very tender years, for more elementary studies. In August, 1773, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was <a href="14096a.htm">suppressed</a>, and the administration of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was handed over to <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. During this period, the students were ill-treated, the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was mismanaged, and a large portion of the archives sold for waste-paper. "At the time of the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a>, the number of students was reduced to four divines, three <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and three grammarians . . . Of those divines and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, only three were <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and two at Douay; and the whole number of those <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from 1775 to the year 1798, a period of 23 years, did not exceed seven, and of those, two never performed any missionary <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, and the third but for a short time. In that same period four died in the College, and 34, if not more, quitted the house <em>re infecta!</em> &#151; Six, however, afterwards pursued their studies in other Colleges, and were <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>." (Catholic Magazine, 1832, pp. 359-360.) Bishop Challoner, and afterwards the three <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, Bishops <a href="14432a.htm">James</a> and <a href="14434a.htm">Thomas Talbot</a> and Matthew Gibson, entreated the Pope to restore the college to its first administrators, the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>; and finally on 12 April, 1783, the Congregation for <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> answered that when the rectorship fell vacant, an <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> might be appointed to the post. Cardinal Baschi, the <a href="03341a.htm">Protector</a>, wrote to <a href="05143a.htm">Bishop Douglas</a> on 4 November, 1797, informing him that the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> was about to resign, and requesting him to choose, in consultation with Mgr. (afterwards <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) <a href="05525b.htm">Erskine</a>, an <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> for the office. But before this could be done, the French had invaded <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the college seized and suppressed, and the students sent to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. On the 30th of July, 1814, <a href="09293a.htm">Cardinal Litta</a>, Prefect of <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, wrote to Bishop Poynter, <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the London District, informing him that the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was about to be reopened, and inquiring about the fitness of the Rev. Stephen Green, who had been recommended by <a href="10315a.htm">Bishop Milner</a> for the rectorship. But Fr. Green died, and other obstacles arose, and nothing more was done for three years. Then <a href="04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a>, Secretary of State, acting as <a href="03341a.htm">protector</a> of the college, directed the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> to suggest a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> as <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, and to send him to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> at once. They chose <a href="06718b.htm">Rev. Robert Gradwell</a>, who received his appointment on 8 March, 1818. Ten students, among whom were the future <a href="15670a.htm">Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman</a>, arrived in the following December. Thus the English College began to live again, and continued to flourish in its career of usefulness to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Scholastic status</h2>

<p>In the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Foundation, <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> confers on the college the privileges and <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> with the power of conferring the degrees of Bachelor, Licentiate, Doctor, and Master in Arts and Divinity. The students, from the beginning, attended the lectures of the Roman College, and then during the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a>, at the University of St. Apollinare (the Roman Seminary). They returned, however, to the Roman College or Gregorian University, in 1855, and still attend it, taking its degrees in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, as the English College does not exercise its faculty of conferring degrees. The college is <a href="05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which is represented by a <a href="03341a.htm">cardinal protector</a>. The immediate superiors are the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> on the recommendation of the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and vice-rector, appointed by the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. The first <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, <a href="04048a.htm">Dr. Maurice Clenock</a> (1578-9), belonged to the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> took the reins of government in 1579, and held them for one hundred and ninety-four years. Three of the rectors were <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a>, and the rest English, the last one being Wm. Hothersall, who, on the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a>, handed the college over to <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. From the restoration in 1818 the rectors have always been chosen from the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The college has the privilege of extra-parochiality, the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> being <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest for all it members, and exemption from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="03341b.htm">cardinal vicar</a> and other ordinaries and tribunals.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Illustrious students</h2>

<p>Among the names of those included on the college lists, who have laid down their lives for the Faith, and the supremacy of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, six have been <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a>, and thirty-six declared venerable. The former are <a href="12636b.htm">Ralph Sherwin</a>, <a href="14689d.htm">John Shert</a>, <a href="15630d.htm">Luke Kerby</a>, <a href="15630d.htm">Laurence Richardson (<em>vere</em> Johnson)</a>, <a href="15631b.htm">William Lacy</a>, and <a href="15631a.htm">William Hart</a>. <a href="14689d.htm">Shert</a> was the first missionary <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> from the college to enter <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The Venerables are: <a href="07159a.htm">George Haydock</a>, Thomas Hemerford, John Munden, John Lowe, <a href="10582b.htm">Robert Morton</a>, <a href="09138a.htm">Richard Leigh</a>, <a href="03092b.htm">Christopher Buxton</a>, Edward James, <a href="02222a.htm">Christopher Ba(y)les</a>, Edmund Duke, <a href="15611b.htm">Eustace White</a>, Polidore Plasden (Palmer). <a href="12282a.htm">Thomas Pormont</a>, Joseph Lampton, <a href="08459a.htm">John Cornelius, S.J.</a>, <a href="08008a.htm">John Ingram</a>, <a href="14164a.htm">Robert Southwell, S.J.</a>, Henry Wallpole, S.J., <a href="11171c.htm#thwing">Edward Thwing</a>, Robert Middleton, <a href="14721c.htm">Thomas Tichborne</a>, Robert Watkins (Wilson), <a href="03142b.htm">Edwards Oldcorne, S.J.</a>, <a href="13098c.htm">John Roberts, O.S.B.</a>, Richard Smith (Newport), <a href="01328c.htm">John Almond</a>, John Thules, <a href="09322a.htm">John Lascelles (<em>vere</em> Lockwood)</a>, <a href="10568a.htm">Edward Morgan (John Singleton)</a>, <a href="10578a.htm">Henry Morse (<em>alias</em> Claxton), S.J.</a>, Brian Cansfield, S.J., <a href="15702a.htm">John Woodcock (<em>alias</em> Farrington), O.F.M.</a>, Edward Mico (<em>alias</em> Banes), Anthony Turner (<em>alias</em> Ashby), S.J., <a href="15537b.htm">John Wall (alias Marsh) O.F.M.</a>, and <a href="02212a.htm">David Lewis (alias Charles Baker), S.J.</a>* The cause of beatification of the following, who all died in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, has not yet been introduced: Roche Chaplain, James Lomax, <a href="13757b.htm">Martin Sherson</a>, John Brushford, John Harrison, and Edward Turner.</p>

<p>The famous <a href="11729a.htm">Father Robert Persons</a> was <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college in 1588, and again from 1598 until his death in 1610. <a href="15486d.htm">Father Muzio Vitelleschi</a>, afterwards General of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, held the rectorship from 1592 to 1594, and again from 1597 to 1598. <a href="15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> went to the College as a student in 1818, became <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> in 1828, and became <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1840. The English College may claim as teachers the great <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the Roman College: <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Vasquez in the distant past; and in modern times, <a href="11702b.htm">Perrone</a>, <a href="06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, <a href="16006b.htm">Ballerini</a>, Billot.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Influence on the Church in England</h2>

<p>The College shares with <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> and other continental <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of having kept alive the lamp of the Faith in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> during the dark days of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Without these colleges, the supply of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the English missions would have entirely failed. Moreover, the college in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was for <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> a connecting unit with the Centre and Head of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>; and the missionaries sent thence formed a visible and tangible bond of union with that <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the supremacy of which the faithful in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> were suffering so much. When we turn to the nineteenth century, it suffices to mention the name of <a href="15670a.htm">Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman</a>, the "Man of Providence" who had the greatest share in the work of the re-establishment of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Hierarchy in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1850, and as its head, by his genius reconciled the English people to what they first regarded as "Papal Aggression". It was he who put the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> on a firm basis, and, under <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, whom we have to thank for the "Second Spring". But <a href="15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> was not alone. Of the rectors of the nineteenth century, all but two were made <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and in every part of the country the English College alumni may be found in positions of responsibility, vicars-general, canons, and especially professors of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> colleges and <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, whence the purity of the Roman Faith is diffused throughout the length and breadth of the land.</p>
