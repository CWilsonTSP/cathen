<p><a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> respectively of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and of St. Louis, Missouri. They were sons of Thomas Kenrick and his wife Jane, and were born in the older part of the city of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the first-named on 3 December, 1797, and the second on 17 August, 1806. An uncle, Father Richard Kenrick was for several years <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="11063b.htm">St. Nicholas of Myra</a> in the same city, and he cultivated carefully the quality of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> which he observed at an early age in both children.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Francis Patrick Kenrick</h2>

<p>Francis Patrick was sent by his uncle to a good classical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, and at the age of eighteen was selected as one of those who were to go to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to study for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Here he became deeply impressed with the gentle bearing of <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, who had just then been restored to his capital after long <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> by <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, and the lesson it taught him bore fruit many years afterwards when he was called on to deal with the onslaughts on <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and their Church in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> in the years of the Nativist and <a href="08677a.htm">Know-nothing</a> uprisings. His progress in his <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> studies was rapid, his <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> conspicuous &#151; so much so as to mark him out for early distinction. He confined himself to the study of his class-books, lectures, and the study of the Scriptures, and worked out in his own mind not a few weighty problems. He soon acquired a familiarity with the patristic writings and the Sacred Text that enabled him later on to give the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> valuable treatises on <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and Biblical literature. He consulted no translations, but took the Hebrew text or the Greek, and pondered on its significance in the light of his own reason and erudition. The <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> College <a href="09293a.htm">Cardinal Litta</a>, had no hesitation in selecting him despite his youth, when a call came from Bishop Flaget for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the American field. He was chosen for the chair of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Bardstown Seminary, Kentucky. This post he held for nine years at the same time teaching Greek and history in the College of St. Joseph in the same state, and giving in addition professorial help in every <a href="13554b.htm">educational institution</a> in the state. He also did much valuable work in the missionary field, and engaged in controversy in the public press with some aggressive polemicists of the Episcopal and <a href="12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> communions. He made many converts at that time, and in 1826-7 had fifty to his credit, as well as a record of twelve hundred confirmations and six thousand communicants. His fame as a preacher was widespread, and his manner most winning.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1829 he attended the <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> as <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> to Bishop Flaget, and was appointed secretary to the assembly. There, among the other weighty subjects, had to be considered the distracted state of the Diocese of Philadelphia, then labouring under the troubles begotten of the Hogan <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Hogan was an <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, who persisted in celebrating <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> and administering the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> despite the <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>, and had a considerable following in the city. Bishop Conwell had by this time become enfeebled and nearly blind, and Rev. William Matthews of Washington had been appointed <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to assist him. Before the council rose it had named Father Kenrick as coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and forwarded the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It was soon confirmed, Doctor Kenrick's title being <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arath <em><a href="08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Bardstown by Bishop Flaget, assisted by Bishops <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, Conwell, David, and Fenwick, on 6 June 1830, being then only thirty-four years old. A quarrel with the trustees of St. Mary's broke out immediately on his arrival, resulting in an <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> being placed upon the church by the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This brought the trustees to their senses, and they gave up the contest for the control of the funds &#151; the power by means of which they had been to browbeat the preceding ordinaries. Bishop Kenrick soon obtained the passage of a law to prevent the recurrence of such conflicts, by having the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> name substituted for those of the trustees in all bequests for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. His first thought, after this trouble was over, was the erection of a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the training of young men for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> quarters in which he began the experiment eventually being succeeded by the present <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Charles Borromeo at Overbrook.</p>

<p>A terrible outbreak of cholera took place in Philadelphia soon after the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> arrival, and he gained the gratitude of the authorities and the people at large for his exertions in the mitigation of the pest. He sent the Sisters of Charity to attend the stricken, and gave the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence of St. Augustine's as a temporary <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a>; the local <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, at the same time, went about fearlessly among the stricken, ministering to their spiritual comforts. For these services he was voted public thanks by the mayor and councils of the city. To the Sisters of Charity was tendered a service of plate by the grateful authorities, but this offer was promptly and politely declined by those ladies. Soon after this episode Bishop Kenrick set about the utilization of the press for the spread of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. He started the "Catholic Herald" placing the paper under the direction of the Reverend John Hughes, afterwards <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York. He also began the erection of the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a> to replace St. Mary's, which had been so fruitful a source of trouble to him and his predecessor. Graver trouble soon started up in the form of the anti-Catholic Nativist outbreak of 1844. Furious mobs, maddened by inflammatory harangues about the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> and the public <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, started out in Philadelphia, as in <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a> and other cities, to attack churches and <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>. They burned St. Augustine's in Philadelphia and attacked St. Michael's and St. John's, but were driven off by the military. They burned many houses in Kensington, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> district, and killed many unoffending people, but were dispersed at Iength by the soldiery, leaving several of their number dead.</p>

<p>Bishop Kenrick, during this reign of terror, did everything he could to stem the rioting. He ordered the doors of all the churches to be closed and cessation of Divine worship as a protest against the supineness of the authorities, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> went about in ordinary civil attire, and the <a href="01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and vestments were taken from the churches to places of security with private <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>. These prudent measures had the effect of restoring a state of peace to the city. The Diocese of Philadelphia had earlier included Pittsburg in a large part of <a href="10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, and in 1843 it was divided, the Rev. Michael O'Connor being <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a> in August of that year by Cardinal Fransoni at St. Agatha's in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This step <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> a great relief to Bishop Kenrick, upon whom the care of his vast diocese and its arduous visitations at a period of primitive crudeness in travelling and accommodation, were beginning to leave a deep mark. In 1845 he visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the first time since his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> and was received most graciously by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In August, 1851, Bishop Kenrick was transferred to Baltimore as successor to <a href="05269a.htm">Archbishop Eccleston</a>, who had just died. Moreover he received from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the dignity of <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>, and in this capacity he convened and presided over the First <a href="02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1852. One of the results of that important gathering was the establishment of branches of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. It was Archbishop Kenrick also who in 1853 introduced the Forty Hours' devotion into the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. In 1854 he was called upon by the Holy Father to collect and forward to him the respective opinions of the American <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Immaculate Conception. The latter part of the same year found him back in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a participant in the ceremonies attendant on the proclamation of that <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>.</p>

<p>A fresh outbreak of anti-Catholic fury took place soon after the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> return, occasioned by the arrival of <a href="02387a.htm">Monsignor Bedini</a> as <a href="11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>, and the inflammatory and lying speeches of the ex-priest Alessandro Gavazzi, on the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio's</a> action while in Bologna during the rising against <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Many churches and <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> were burned as in the previous outbreak, and many lives were lost in New England and Kentucky, in <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> and other cities. But no religious disturbances occurred in <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> to perturb the archbishop's closing years. The Civil War, however, soon came to rend his heart, and he died on the morning after the battle of Gettysburg (8 July, 1863), his end being hastened, it was believed, by rumours of the terrible slaughter that went on not far from his residence. When Bishop Kenrick went to Philadelphia in 1830 there were only four churches in the city and one in the suburbs, and ten <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, when he left at in 1857, the diocese contained 94 churches and many religious institutions, and was the home of 101 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and 46 seminarians, besides numerous <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The chief literary works of Archbishop Kenrick were a new translation of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, with a commentary; a "Moral and Dogmatic Theology"; a "Commentary on the Book of Job", "The Primacy of Peter", and letters to the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> on <a href="15132a.htm">Christian unity</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Peter Richard Kenrick</h2>

<p>Peter Richard had to work closely in the scriveners office of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> after the latter's death in order to help to maintain his mother and himself, as well as carry on the business, but was enabled by his own industry and his uncle's help to enter <a href="10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a> at the age of twenty-one. Previous to his entry he had been tolerably well trained in Latin and other essentials by Father Richard, while his taste for secular literature had been acquired through associations with the unfortunate poet and <em>litt&eacute;rateur</em>, <a href="09589a.htm">James Clarance Mangan</a>, who had for several years worked beside him as a clerk at the scrivener's desk. After five years' assiduous study he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> by <a href="10646b.htm">Archbishop Murray</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and, on the death of his mother, after a few months of local missionary work, left for the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> on the invitation of his brother and took up work with him in Philadelphia. He was given the post of president of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> as well as that of <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. This was in the latter part of 1833. During his seven years of missionary work with his brother he produced several works which built up his fame as a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, as "Validity of Anglican Ordinations examined" (Philadelphia, 1841), "New Month of Mary", and "History of the Holy House of Loretto" in 1840 he left for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of entering the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>, but was dissuaded from carrying out his intention by the superior in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Bishop Rosati met the young <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> there, and requested the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to give him to the See of St. Louis as his coadjutor, so pleased was he with his character and qualities. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> assented, and both returned from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to have the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> performed in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. This was done in Philadelphia, Bishop Rosati officiating and the new <a href="12386b.htm">prelate's</a> brother and Bishop Lef&egrave;vre of <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a> assisting, while <a href="05470a.htm">Bishop England</a> delivered the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>.</p>

<p>The new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was given the title of Drasa, and had the right of succession in St. Louis. Bishop Rosati died a short time afterwards on a special mission in <a href="07114a.htm">Haiti</a>, and the care of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> devolved upon his young coadjutor at a much earlier period than either could have anticipated. It was no sinecure, for the financial affairs of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in St. Louis were in a deplorable condition. There was a very heavy <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> on the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and he found the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> by no means anxious to remove it. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> then saw that he must either resign or get other means of raising funds, and he took the bold course of getting into the real-estate business. He was most successful. A local gentleman named Thornton made a bequest of 300,000 dollars to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, others deposited their money with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; he made fortunate investments in real estate; and, when values generally declined on the outbreak of the Civil War, he paid all his depositors in gold. The St. Louis <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was enormous in extent at that time, as it embraced the whole of the States of Missouri and Arkansas, and half of Illinois, the task of visitation was one of immense toil, but the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> did not shrink from it. He had for helper and companion Rev. Thomas Cusack, with whom he had often to ride hundreds of miles on horseback, and sleep at night time in a log cabin or boarded hut. The paucity of churches in the diocese he also found a great drawback, the lack of <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was another. He soon obtained much help from the <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> and <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, as well as from the German population. The Visitation <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, as well as the Sisters of Charity driven out by fire and flood from other places, came to St. Louis, and soon matters began to look brighter for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. By a brief from <a href="12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, the dignity of archbishop was bestowed upon him; and at the Seventh <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> a petition to have five suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed &#151; namely for <a href="13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="10704c.htm">Nashville</a>, <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and Milwaukee &#151; was adopted, and was granted by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. After consecrating many <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and ordaining many <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> went to Baltimore to attend the First Plenary Council, and made a profound impression on the assembly by his <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> keenness and his great erudition.</p>

<p>The Civil War found him a resolute defender of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> position, when the "Drake Constitution" which proposed a test <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> for all <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of religion, was passed in <a href="10398a.htm">Missouri</a>. He sent out an order that all his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> must refuse to take the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>, as its terms were insulting. Some of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were sent to <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> for doing so, but the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> took their cases from court to court and ultimately succeeded in having the Drake Law declared unconstitutional. At the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> of December, 1869, he was one of the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> who were opposed to the definition of the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a>, and voted "non placet" at the preliminary private sitting. He did not attend the session at which the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> was <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, but publicly submitted to the voice of the majority as the authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, when he learned of the proclamation. For coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> he had firstly the Right Reverend P.J. Ryan, and secondly the Right Reverend John J. Kain, who on his death succeeded him. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> golden jubilee was celebrated with great distinction in 1891, but he was then in very feeble health. He died on 3 March two years afterwards. His best known work, besides "Anglican Ordinations," is the "Month of Mary" (Philadelphia, 1843). The growth of the St. Louis province under his rule was described by Archbishop Hennessy at the jubilee celebration in 1891 as "stupendous". During his episcopate sixteen new Sees were carved out of the original Diocese of St. Louis, viz. Little Rock (1843), Santa Fe and <a href="13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> (1850); Leavenworth (1851); Alton and Omaha (1857); Green Bay, <a href="08735b.htm">La Crosse</a>, <a href="13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, and <a href="04733c.htm">Denver</a> (1868); Kansas City (1880) Davenport (1881) Wichita, <a href="03651a.htm">Cheyenne</a>, <a href="04206a.htm">Concordia</a>, and Lincoln (1887).</p>
