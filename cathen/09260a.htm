<p>(L<font size=-2>IMBURGENSIS</font>)</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the <a href="12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a>, suffragan of <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>This diocese dates from the end of the eighteenth century. The city of Limburg then belonged to the Elector of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, but the north-eastern part of the present diocese lay outside of any <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> territory, having been under <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> rulers since the Peace of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. It was administered in spiritual matters from <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, through the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> at Coblenz. When the latter city fell into the hands of the French (1794), the administrator, Archdeacon Joseph Ludwig Beck, was given <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> over that part of the <a href="15042a.htm">Diocese of Trier</a> which lay on the right bank of the Rhine, the seat of his administration being Limburg. When, in 1801, the left bank of the Rhine came into the possession of the French, the three rural deaneries of the Archdiocese of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> on the right bank still continued to exist, but in 1803 passed to the princes of Nassau-Weilburg, who allowed the vicariate-general at Limburg to continue, but diverted various <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenues and, in the city of Limburg, suppressed the collegiate chapter which had existed since the tenth century. In 1802 the last <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Klemens Wenceslaus, appointed Beck sole <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for what remained of the archdiocese, and after the death of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (1812) Beck was confirmed in this position by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (1813). His <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration was carried on under the most difficult circumstances, in spite of which he did not fail to provide for a well-trained <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and to encourage learning and virtue among his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Upon his death (3 February, 1816), the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a>, Dalberg, in his capacity as <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and nearest <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, appointed Hubert Anton Corden, <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Limburg, to be administrator and director of the vicariate (15 December, 1816). <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> appointed him, 8 July, 1818, <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> for the Archdiocese of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>. <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> did not recognize the new vicariate, and forbade Corden to administer the <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> which were under <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> rule. A separate Diocese of Limburg was the only possible solution of the difficulty. Long negotiations, begun in 1818 at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>, were carried on between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Governments interested, with the result that the <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine was established in 1821, and, as a part of it, the Diocese of Limburg. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <em>Provida solersque</em>, establishing the new diocese, was issued 16 August, 1821, but, on account of a dispute between the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Governments concerned, the See of Limburg was not filled for five years. The first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Jacob Brand, <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Wieskirchen (b. 29 January, 1776, at Mespellbrunn in Franconia), proposed by the Government, confirmed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 21 October, 1827.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The new diocese consisted of the fifty-seven <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the Duchy of Nassau that had formerly been under the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and in 1821 had been placed under the <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> Corden, the free imperial city of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>, fifty-one <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the former Archdiocese of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and twenty-five <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in which no episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> had been exercised since the Peace of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. In 1828 the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided into fifteen deaneries. The former collegiate and <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George, at Limburg, which since the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> had been in a dilapidated condition, became the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The endowment was, as <a href="12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> himself expressed it, a "deplorable" one, and amounted only to 21,606 gulden for both the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the entire <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. This endowment was administered by the secular Government, as was also the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> central fund (<em>Zentralkirchenfonds</em>) for the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, over which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> had no control whatever. The position of the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, little worthy of his rank, suffered from the ecclesiastical laws of Nassau in which he had too easily acquiesced before his appointment. In <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> he was only a paid dependent upon the nod of the Government, put in charge of the purely religious affairs of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of this territory. He issued a number of excellent ordinances during his brief term of office. Having himself been a teacher, he devoted special and enlightened care to the founding of an <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>, which was opened in 1829 in a former <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> granted for the purpose by the Government. He prepared the way for a special <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, but did not live to see it established, dying in 1835. The second <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Johann Wilhelm Bausch (1835-40), was likewise unable to secure from the Government any appreciable measure of freedom. Any attempt to control the central <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> fund brought upon him and the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter a sharp rebuke.</p>

<p>In the appointment of the third <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Peter Joseph Blum (1842-84), the diocese gained a man who, aided by the changed conditions of the times, was able to carry on a successful contest for greater liberty in the administration of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. He cared for the religious quickening of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the introduction and <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> fostering of general confession, of religious brotherhoods, and a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> press, the dissemination of good books, and the practice of spiritual exercises, which he succeeded in establishing after some opposition from the Government. The year of the Revolution, 1848, brought to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> some freedom from the system of state guardianship until then in force, and permitted for the first time the holding of popular missions, which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> introduced as early as 1850. In that year also, he obtained possession of the former <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bornhofen, a much-frequented <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, and there founded a house of <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, in spite of government opposition. The first house of the Poor Handmaids of Christ was founded in 1850 at Dernbach; it gradually developed into a large mother-house with numerous branches. In 1855 followed the house of the Brothers of Mercy at Montabaur; in 1862, the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> protectory of Marienstatt; in 1850, the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> of the Sisters of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> at Limburg, etc. Gradually the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> replaced the old undenominational <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> which he obtained permission to establish. In 1851 a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> normal <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was founded at Montabaur; in 1852 a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> for boys was opened at Hadamar, and in 1872 another at Montabaur. From 1851 the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> had an eight years' struggle with the Government in regard to the filling of vacant <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; it ended by the establishment in principle of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> right to independent administration of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and to the appointment and training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The political independence of the Duchy of Nassau and of the imperial free city of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a> came to an end in the German <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of 1866, after which both were incorporated in the <a href="12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. New <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, missions, and exercises were made possible by the introduction into the new territory of the same legal freedom of action as the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> then enjoyed in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. These favourable circumstances did not last long. The <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, beginning in 1872, destroyed at Limburg the greater part of what had been created by long years of work. Several institutions were closed by the expulsion of the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Poor Handmaids of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the English Ladies, etc., while the <a href="11235b.htm">Old-Catholic</a> legislation transferred a number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches to this new <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. By the Sperrgesetz, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Limburg found themselves deprived of salaries, while the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after suffering fines and distraints for filling <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> without giving to the Government the newly prescribed notification, was, in 1876, expelled from office by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, and exiled. He administered his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as well as possible, from Haid, in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, where Prince von L&ouml;wenstein generously granted him an asylum. It was not until 1883 that he was able to return to Limburg.</p>

<p>The spirit of Bishop Blum lived in his successors, Johann Christian Roos, who, after a short episcopate (1885-86), was raised to the archiepiscopal See of <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, and Karl Klein (1886-98), dean of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Dr. Klein had been for many years the trusted <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of Bishop Blum. During his episcopate the former <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Marienstatt was restored (1888) by <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> from <a href="10146d.htm">Mehrerau</a>, near <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>. The same <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> also founded a <em>Schola Gregoriana</em> to provide music for the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built a new <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and made <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> efforts to repair the damage caused by the <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>. He was succeeded by Dominikus Willi, first <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the new Marienstatt.</p>

<p>The Diocese of Limburg includes the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> civil district of Wiesbaden in the Province of Hesse-Nassau, with the exception of that part of the city of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a> which belongs to the <a href="06313b.htm">Diocese of Fulda</a> and four towns in the Grand Duchy of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>. There are, taken altogether, 413,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inhabitants.
