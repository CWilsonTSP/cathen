<h2 id="section1">Etymology and meaning</h2>

<p>The word "sect" is not derived, as is sometimes asserted, from <em>secare</em>, to cut, to dissect, but from <em>sequi</em>, to follow (Skeat, "Etymological Dict.", 3rd ed., Oxford, 1898, s.v.). In the classical Latin tongue <em>secta</em> signified the mode of thought, the manner of life and, in a more specific sense, designated the political party to which one had sworn allegiance, or the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> whose tenets he had embraced. Etymologically no offensive connotation is attached to the term. In the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> it is applied both in the Latin of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> and in the English of the <a href="05140a.htm">Douay version</a> to the religious tendency with which one has identified himself (xxiv, 5; xxvi, 5; xxviii, 22; see xxiv, 14). The Epistles of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> disparagingly apply it to the divisions within the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities. The Epistle to the Galatians (v, 20) numbers among the works of the flesh, "quarrels, dissensions, sects"; and St. Peter in his second Epistle (ii, 1) speaks of the "lying teachers, who shall bring in sects of perdition". In subsequent <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usage this meaning was retained (see Augustine, <a href="../fathers/140620.htm"><em>Reply to Faustus</em> XX.3</a>); but in <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity and the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the term was of much less frequent use than "heresy" or "schism". These words were more specific and consequently clearer. Moreover, as <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> directly designated substantial <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> and sect applied to external fellowship, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has always attached paramount importance to soundness in <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, would naturally prefer the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> designation.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>With the rise of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and the consequent disruption of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> into numerous denominations, the use of the word sect has become frequent among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. It usually implies at present disapproval in the mind of the speaker or writer. Such, however, is not necessarily the case as is evidenced by the widely used expression "sectarian" (for denominational) institutions and by the statement of the well-known authority H. W. Lyon that he uses the word "in no invidious sense" ("A Study of the Sects", <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>, 1891, p. 4). This extension of the term to all <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> denominations results no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>, from the tendency of the modern non-Catholic world to consider all the various forms of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as the embodiment of <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> and as equally entitled to recognition. Some churches, however, still take exception to the application of the term to themselves because of its implication, in their eyes, of inferiority or depreciation. The <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> denominations which assume such an attitude are at a loss to determine the essential elements of a sect. In countries like <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where State Churches exist, it is usual to apply the name "sect" to all dissenters. Obedience to the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a> in religious matters thus becomes the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> prerequisite for a fair religious name. In lands where no particular religion is officially recognized the distinction between Church and sect is considered impossible by some <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (Loofs, "Symbolik", Leipzig, 1902, 74). Others claim that the preaching of the pure and unalloyed <a href="13001a.htm">Word of God</a>, the legitimate administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the historical identification with the national life of a people entitle a denomination to be designated as a Church; in the absence of these qualifications it is merely a sect (Kalb, 592-94). This, however, does not solve the question; for what authority among <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> will ultimately and to their general satisfaction judge of the character of the preaching or the manner in which the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are administered? Furthermore, an historical religion may contain many elements of falsehood. Roman <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> was more closely identified with the life of the nation than any <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> religion ever was, and still it was an utterly defective religious system. It was a non-Christian system, but the example nevertheless illustrates the point at issue; for a religion <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> will remain so independently of subsequent historical association or national service.</p>

<p>To the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> the distinction of Church and sect presents no difficulty. For him, any <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> denomination which has set itself up independently of his own Church is a sect. According to <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> any <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> who, banded together refuse to accept the entire <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or to acknowledge the supreme authority of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, constitute merely a religious party under human unauthorized leadership. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> alone is that universal <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> instituted by <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> which has a rightful claim to the allegiance of all men, although in fact, this allegiance is withheld by many because of <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and the abuse of <a href="06259a.htm">free-will</a>. She is the sole custodian of the complete teaching of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> which must be accepted in its entirety by all <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Her members do not constitute a sect nor will they consent to be known as such, because they do not belong to a party called into existence by a human leader, or to a school of thought sworn to the dictates of a mortal master. They form part of a Church which embraces all space and in a certain sense both time and <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>, since it is militant, suffering, and triumphant. This claim that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion is the only genuine form of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> may startle some by its exclusiveness. But the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> is necessarily exclusive; it must exclude <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> just as necessarily as light is incompatible with darkness. As all non-Catholic denominations reject some <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> or <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> taught by Christ, or repudiate the authority instituted by him in his Church, they have in some essential point sacrificed his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to human learning or his authority to self-constituted leadership. That the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> should refuse to acknowledge such religious <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> as organizations, like herself, of Divine origin and authority is the only <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> course open to her. No fair-minded <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> will be offended at this if it be remembered that faithfulness to its Divine mission enforces this uncompromising attitude on the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. It is but a practical assertion of the principle that Divinely <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot and must not be sacrificed to human objection and speculation. But while the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> condemns the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of non-Catholics, she teaches the practice of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and charity towards their <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, repudiates the use of <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> and compulsion to effect their conversion and is ever ready to welcome back into the fold <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who have strayed from the path of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Historical survey; causes; remedy of sectarianism</h2>

<p>The recognition by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the sects which sprang up in the course of her history would necessarily have been fatal to herself and to any consistent religious organization. From the time when Jewish and <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> elements threatened the purity of her <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to the days of <a href="10415a.htm">modernistic errors</a>, her history would have been but one long accommodation to new and sometimes contradictory opinions. <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>, <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a> in the earlier days and <a href="01267e.htm">Albigensianism</a>, Hussitism, and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> of later date, to mention only a few <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, would have called for equal recognition. The different parties into which the sects usually split soon after their separation from the Mother Church would have been entitled in their turn to similar consideration. Not only <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, and <a href="15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a>, but all the countless sects springing from them would have had to be looked upon as equally capable of leading men to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> and <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The present existence of 168 <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> denominations in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> alone sufficiently illustrates this contention. A Church adopting such a policy of universal approval is not liberal but indifferent; it does not lead but follows and cannot be said to have a teaching mission among men. Numerous general causes may be assigned for the disruption of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Among the principal ones were <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> controversies, disobedience to disciplinary prescriptions, and dissatisfaction with real or fancied <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> abuses. Political issues and national sentiment also had a share in complicating the religious difficulty. Moreover reasons of a personal nature and human passions not infrequently hindered that calm exercise of judgment so <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in religious matters. These general causes resulted in the rejection of the vivifying principle of <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> authority which is the foundation of all unity.</p>

<p>It is this principle of a living authority divinely commissioned to preserve and authoritatively interpret Divine Revelation which is the bond of union among the different members of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. To its repudiation is not only due the initial separation of non-Catholics, but also their subsequent failure in preserving union among themselves. <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in particular, by its proclamation of the right of private interpretation of the <a href="../bible.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> swept away with one stroke all living authority and constituted the individual supreme judge in <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> matters. Its divisions are therefore but natural, and its <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> trials in disagreement with one of its fundamental principles. The disastrous results of the many divisions among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> are keenly felt today and the longing for union is manifest. The manner, however, in which the desired result may be attained is not clear to non-Catholics. Many see the solution in undogmatic <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> or undenominationalism. The points of disagreement, they believe, ought to be overlooked and a common basis for union thus obtained. Hence they advocate the relegation of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> differences to the background and attempt to rear a united <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> chiefly on a moral basis. This plan, however, rests on a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> assumption; for its minimizes, in an unwarranted degree, the importance of the right teaching and sound <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> and thus tends to transform <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into a mere <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> code. From the inferior position assigned to <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> principles there is but one step to their partial or complete rejection, and undenominationalism, instead of being a return to the unity desired by Christ, cannot but result in the destruction of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It is not in the further rejection of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> that the divisions of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> can be healed, but in the sincere acceptance of what has been discarded; the remedy lies in the return of all dissenters to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
