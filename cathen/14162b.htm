<p>DIOCESE OF SOUTHWARK (SOUTHWARCENSIS)</p>

<p>Suffragan of <a href="15598a.htm">Westminster</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, comprises the south-eastern counties of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex south of the Thames, including the southern half of the administrative County of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. Southwark, the principal borough in South London, is the episcopal city. This <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was founded on the restoration of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1851, and when first erected included Berkshire, Hampshire, and the Channel Islands in addition to Surrey, Kent and Sussex. Previous to this these five counties formed part of the London District, which district was governed by a <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, to whom also was committed episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over North America and the Bahama Islands. In 1850 <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, even at that time a comparatively small city, which, owing to the exigencies of the times, had previously been under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a single <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was now divided between the two new Dioceses of Westminster (north of the Thames) and Southwark (south of the Thames), the newly-erected Church of St. George, Southwark, a stately and magnificent structure in the <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style designed by the elder Pugin, being designated as the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the newly-erected see. On 6 July, 1851 Right Rev. Thomas Grant, D.D., vice-rector of the <a href="05472b.htm">English College, Rome</a>, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the early age of thirty-five. He was succeeded 25 March, 1871, by Right Rev. James Danell, formerly his <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. The next occupant of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was <a href="04093c.htm">Bishop Robert Coffin</a>, who at the time of his appointment in 1882 was Provincial of the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> in Great Britain and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. On his demise in 1885 the choice of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> fell upon his auxiliary, Bishop John Butt, who governed the diocese for twelve years until his resignation in 1897, when he was succeeded by his coadjutor, Bishop Francis Bourne, who became <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a> in 1903.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The present <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Right Rev. Peter Emmanuel Amigo, was born at <a href="06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a>, 26 May, 1864. He studied at <a href="15233b.htm">St. Edmund's</a>, Ware, and St. Thomas's, Hammersmith; was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, 25 Feb., 1888; was for a short time at Stoke Newington, then professor at <a href="15233b.htm">St. Edmund's</a> from Sept., 1888, to July, 1892. He was then appointed assistant <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at Hammersmith from Sept., 1892, to June, 1896. He was afterwards at St. Mary's and St. Michael's, Commercial Road, first as assistant <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, then as <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> from June, 1896, to April, 1901. He was then appointed <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the mission at Walworth in the Diocese of Southwark, and remained there until his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Southwark, 25 March, 1904. He is strenuously engaged in carrying on to their fullness the various important works initiated by his predecessors by multiplying much-needed churches and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in all parts of this important diocese, as well as endeavouring to pay off the enormous liabilities that in past years have had to be incurred in emergencies when there would have been the gravest danger of loss of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, especially to the destitute little ones of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, if the large and magnificently-equipped <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and poor-law <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> had not been promptly erected. In addition to the <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> on the institutions there are also enormous <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> incurred in the building of new churches and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in new and rapidly-growing centres of population, which were <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> if work for the good or <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> was to be adequately carried on in the midst of the huge population of South <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> and its environs. There is every prospect that the efforts of the present <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in this direction will be <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> with complete success, as he has already succeeded in securing for the important work of safeguarding the poorer children of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> from loss of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> the united and cordial co-operation of not only the whole of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but also of every class of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, which is eloquently attested by the totals of the subscriptions and collections for this purpose, which go on steadily increasing from year to year. As a consequence of this united support of <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, joined with the establishment of a sinking fund for the gradual extinction of mission <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a>, Bishop Amigo looks forward to handing over to his successor at the close of his life a splendid array of churches, <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and institutions, all entirely free from <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>.</p>

<p>Southwark in many ways occupies a notable position amongst the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. First of all, South London, with its enormous population of close on two million inhabitants (census of 1911, 1,844,310) is one of the largest cities in the world as well as one of the poorest. Being for the most part a place of residence for the salaried workers of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> north of the Thames, where all trade and business is concentrated, South London, with its immense population, has scarcely a single hotel above the level of the third class to be found within its area. Outside the boundaries of South <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> proper there stretches towards the south a fringe of more sparsely populated residential districts, inhabited chiefly by the well-to-do professional and business people of the City of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, amongst whom there are very few <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Between this residential zone and the English Channel lies, still further to the south, a pleasant well-wooded agricultural district that is also day by day becoming more residential in character, until the sea-coast is reached with its chain of watering places, girdling the coast line of Kent and Sussex from the mouth of the Thames on the north to beyond Selsey Bill on the south. These resorts are really suburbs of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> by the sea, and in the summer months especially are filled by visitors drawn from all parts of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>.</p>

<p>The County of Kent, one of the most important of the rural divisions of this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, will always have an interest for English-speaking <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of all times, as the district in which <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was first preached in the Saxon tongue by <a href="02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and his followers, who landed near Richborough on the coast of Kent in 597. The actual church in which the Apostle of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> offered up the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> is still to be seen to this very day at <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, which, once the Primatial <a href="05001a.htm">See</a> of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, is now an unimportant and dwindling country town of this large diocese. The Diocese of Southwark, it may be noted, includes within its present boundaries not only the whole of the territories formerly belonging to the former Dioceses of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, Rochester, and Chichester, but also a large portion of the former <a href="15649c.htm">Diocese of Winchester</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> may also be said to owe the world-wide devotion of the <a href="13508b.htm">Brown Scapular</a> to this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as <a href="13800a.htm">St. Simon Stock</a>, its propagator, was born in the Weald of Kent towards the end of the twelfth century.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Another striking characteristic of this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the very marked increase shown in the numbers of churches, <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. Thus in 1882 the Diocese of Southwark comprised South London, the five counties of Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Berkshire, and Hampshire, and the Channel Islands. On the appointment of <a href="04093c.htm">Bishop Coffin</a> in 1882 the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided, and the Counties of Berkshire and Hampshire, together with the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands, were separated from the diocese and erected in the new <a href="12296a.htm">Diocese of Portsmouth</a>. Before the division Southwark had 148 public churches, <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations, with 247 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. After the division the present diocese started afresh with only 93 public churches, <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations, served by 198 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. The diocese now has 218 public churches, <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations, with a population of almost 120,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> whilst the number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> attached to or working in the diocese amounts to 591, a higher total than any other English diocese. Besides the above-mentioned public places of worship, there are also 160 private <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, either belonging to <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities or in private houses, where Mass is as a rule celebrated daily.</p>

<p>As might be expected from the foregoing facts, he <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, owing to the encouragement they have always received from a succession of broad-minded and progressive <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> with high ideals and exceptional gifts of organization, have always been noted for their <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, initiative, and gift of combination amongst themselves for the furtherance of every good work. It has always been their <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> to have the most up-to-date and best-equipped <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in the country, and they led the way in the foundation of <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> pupil-teachers' centres, for the training of the coming generation of teachers, before the work was made a public charge. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of South <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> especially have also distinguished themselves by the active share they have always taken, with their <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hearty approval, in the great work of local government and administration, many of them having done splendid work for religion on public bodies such as the former <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> School Board, as well as upon the Boards of Guardians and the local councils. The South <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> League, a non-political body for the protection of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests in South London, with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> as president, bears witness to the very successful way in which the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> as well as the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> of all parties have discovered the secret of successful organization on a purely <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> platform, to the exclusion of party or national politics.</p>

<p>Ever since 1891, when it was first started, "Pastoralia", the popular little <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> review for the discussion of pastoral topics, has been edited by a committee mainly of South <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and has a large circulation amongst the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of English-speaking lands. Its pages are full of interest as giving an insight into problems and difficulties the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has to face in great cities, as well as the practical means by which new methods are evolved to meet present-day exigencies.</p>
