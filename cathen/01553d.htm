<p>Founder of <a href="10464a.htm">Christian monasticism</a>.</p>

<p>The chief source of information on St. Anthony is a <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Greek Life</a> attributed to <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, to be found in any edition of his works. A note of the controversy concerning this <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a> is given at the end of this article; here it will suffice to say that now it is received with practical unanimity by scholars as a substantially historical record, and as a probably <a href="02137a.htm">authentic</a> work of <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>.</p>

<p>Valuable subsidiary information is supplied by secondary sources: the "Apophthegmata", chiefly those collected under Anthony's name (at the head of <a href="04421b.htm">Cotelier's</a> alphabetical collection, P.G. LXV, 7]); <a href="03404a.htm">Cassian</a>, especially Coll. II; <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, "Historica Lausiaca", 3, 4, 21, 22 (ed. Butler). All this matter may probably be accepted as substantially <a href="02137a.htm">authentic</a>, whereas what is related concerning St. Anthony in <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> "Life of St. Paul the Hermit" cannot be used for historical purposes.</p>

<p>Anthony was born at Coma, near Heracleopolis Magna in Fayum, about the middle of the third century. He was the son of well-to-do <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, and on their death, in his twentieth year, he inherited their possessions. He had a desire to imitate the life of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and the early <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and one day, on hearing in the church the Gospel words, "If thou wilt be <a href="11665b.htm">perfect</a>, go and sell all thou hast", he received them as spoken to himself, disposed of all his <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> and goods, and devoted himself exclusively to religious exercises.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Long before this it had been usual for <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> to practice <a href="01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, <a href="04330b.htm">abstain from marriage</a> and exercising themselves in self-denial, <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and works of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>; but this they had done in the midst of their <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>, and without leaving house or home. Later on, in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, such ascetics lived in huts, in the outskirts of the towns and villages, and this was the common practice about 270, when Anthony withdrew from the world. He began his career by practising the <a href="01767c.htm">ascetical life</a> in this fashion without leaving his native place. He used to visit the various ascetics, study their lives, and try to learn from each of them the <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a> in which he seemed to excel. Then he took up his abode in one of the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a>, near his native village, and there it was that the <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a> records those strange conflicts with <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a> in the shape of wild beasts, who inflicted blows upon him, and sometimes left him nearly dead.</p>

<p>After fifteen years of this life, at the age of thirty-five, Anthony determined to withdraw from the habitations of <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> and retire in absolute solitude. He crossed the Nile, and on a mountain near the east bank, then called Pispir, now Der el Memum, he found an old fort into which he shut himself, and lived there for twenty years without seeing the face of <a href="09580c.htm">man</a>, food being thrown to him over the wall. He was at times visited by <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, whom he refused to see; but gradually a number of would-be <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a> established themselves in caves and in huts around the mountain, Thus a colony of ascetics was formed, who begged Anthony to come forth and be their guide in the spiritual life. At length, about the year 305, he yielded to their importunities an emerged from his <a href="12795b.htm">retreat</a>, and, to the surprise of all, he appeared to be as when he had gone in, not emaciated, but vigorous in body and <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>.</p>

<p>For five or six years he devoted himself to the instruction and organization of the great body of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> that had grown up around him; but then he once again withdrew into the inner <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> that lay between the Nile and the <a href="12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, near the shore of which he fixed his abode on a mountain where still stands the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> that bears his name, Der Mar Antonios. Here he spent the last forty-five years of his life, in a <a href="04060a.htm">seclusion</a>, not so strict as Pispir, for he freely saw those who came to visit him, and he used to cross the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> to Pispir with considerable frequency. The <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a> says that on two occasions he went to Alexandria, once after he came forth from the fort at Pispir, to strengthen the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 311, and once at the close of his life (c. 350), to preach against the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>. The <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a> says he died at the age of a hundred and five, and <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> places his death in 356-357. All the <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a> is based on the hypothesis that this <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> and the figures in the <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a> are correct. At his own request his grave was kept secret by the two <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a> who <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> him, lest his body should become an object of reverence.</p>

<p>Of his writings, the most authentic formulation of his teaching is without doubt that which is contained in the various sayings and discourses put into his mouth in the <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a>, especially the long ascetic <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> (16-43) spoken on his coming forth from the fort at Pispir. It is an instruction on the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the spiritual life, in which the warfare with <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a> occupies the chief place. Though probably not an actual discourse spoken on any single occasion, it can hardly be a mere invention of the biographer, and doubtless reproduces St. Anthony's actual <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, brought together and co-ordinated. It is likely that many of the sayings attributed to him in the "Apophthegmata" really go back to him, and the same may be said of the stories told of him in <a href="03404a.htm">Cassian</a> and <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>. There is a homogeneity about these records, and a certain dignity and spiritual elevation that seem to mark them with the stamp of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to justify the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> that the picture they give us of St Anthony's <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>, <a href="03584b.htm">character</a>, and teaching is essentially <a href="02137a.htm">authentic</a>.</p>

<p>A different verdict has to be passed on the writings that go under his name, to be found in P.G., XL. The Sermons and twenty Epistles from the Arabic are by common consent pronounced wholly spurious. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 88</a>) <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> seven epistles translated from the Coptic into Greek; the Greek appears to be lost, but a Latin version exists (ibid.), and Coptic fragments exist of three of these letters, agreeing closely with the Latin; they may be <a href="02137a.htm">authentic</a>, but it would be premature to decide. Better is the position of a Greek letter to Theodore, preserved in the "Epistola Ammonis ad Theophilum", sect. 20, and said to be a translation of a Coptic original; there seems to be no sufficient ground for <a href="05141a.htm">doubting</a> that it really was written by Anthony (see Butler, Lausiac History of Palladius, Part I, 223). The authorities are agreed that St. Anthony <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> no Greek and spoke only Coptic. There exists a <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> Rule that bears St. Anthony's name, preserved in Latin and Arabic forms (P.G., XL, 1065). While it cannot be received as having been actually composed by Anthony, it probably in large measure goes back to him, being for the most part made up out of the utterances attributed to him in the <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a> and the "Apophthegmata"; it contains, however, an element derived from the spuria and also from the "Pachomian Rules". It was compiled at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, and had a great vogue in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the East. At this day it is the rule followed by the <a href="05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="10487b.htm">Monks</a> of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, of whom the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, with sixty <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and 1,100 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, are the most important; it is followed also by the scanty remnants of Coptic <a href="10472a.htm">monachism</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It will be proper to define St. Anthony's place, and to explain his influence in the history of <a href="10459a.htm">Christian monachism</a>. He probably was not the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a>; it is more reasonable to <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> that, however little historical <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> "Vita Pauli" may be, some kernel of fact underlies the story (Butler, op. cit., Part I, 231, 232), but Paul's existence was wholly unknown till long after Anthony has become the recognized leader of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a>. Nor was St. Anthony a great legislator and organizer of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, like his younger contemporary <a href="11381a.htm">Pachomius</a>; for, though Pachomius's first foundations were probably some ten or fifteen years later than Anthony's coming forth from his retreat at Pispir, it cannot be shown that <a href="11381a.htm">Pachomius</a> was directly influenced by Anthony, indeed his institute ran on quite different lines. And yet it is abundantly evident that from the middle of the fourth century throughout <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as elsewhere, and among the Pachomian <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> themselves, St. Anthony was looked upon as the founder and father of <a href="10459a.htm">Christian monachism</a>.</p>

<p>This great position was no doubt due to his commanding <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> and high <a href="03584b.htm">character</a>, qualities that stand out clearly in all the records of him that have come down. The best study of his <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> is <a href="10794a.htm">Newman's</a> in the "Church of the Fathers" (reprinted in "Historical Sketches"). The following is his estimate: "His <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> surely was pure and unimpeachable; and his temper is high and <a href="07170a.htm">heavenly</a>, without cowardice, without gloom, without formality, without self-complacency. <a href="14339a.htm">Superstition</a> is abject and crouching, it is full of thoughts of guilt; it distrusts <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and dreads the powers of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>. Anthony at least had nothing of this, being full of confidence, divine peace, <a href="07131b.htm">cheerfulness</a>, and valorousness, be he (as some men may judge) ever so much an enthusiast" (op. cit., Anthony in Conflict). Full of enthusiasm he was, but it did not make him fanatical or morose; his urbanity and gentleness, his moderation and sense stand out in many of the stories related of him. Abbot Moses in <a href="03404a.htm">Cassian</a> (Coll. II) says he had heard Anthony maintaining that of all <a href="15472a.htm">virtues</a> discretion was the most essential for attaining <a href="11665b.htm">perfection</a>; and the little known story of Eulogius and the Cripple, preserved in the Lausiac History (xxi), illustrates the kind of advice and direction he gave to those who sought his guidance.</p>

<p>The <a href="10459a.htm">monasticism</a> established under St. Anthony's direct influence became the norm in Northern <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from <a href="09468a.htm">Lycopolis (Asyut)</a> to the Mediterranean. In contradistinction to the fully coenobitical system, established by <a href="11381a.htm">Pachomius</a> in the South, it continued to be of a semi-eremetical character, the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> living commonly in separate cells or huts, and coming together only occasionally for church services; they were left very much to their own devices, and the life they lived was not a community life according to rule, as now understood (see Butler, op. cit., Part I, 233-238). This was the form of <a href="12748b.htm">monastic life</a> in the <a href="04749a.htm">deserts</a> of Nitria and Scete, as portrayed by <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> and <a href="03404a.htm">Cassian</a>. Such groups of semi-independent hermitages were later on called <a href="09039a.htm">Lauras</a>, and have always existed in the East alongside of the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> St. Anthony's <a href="10472a.htm">monachism</a> is in some measure represented by the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>. Such was St. Anthony's life and <a href="03584b.htm">character</a>, and such his role in <a href="07365a.htm">Christian history</a>. He is justly recognized as the father not only of <a href="10459a.htm">monasticism</a>, strictly so called, but of the technical <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> in every shape and form. Few names have exercised on the <a href="09580c.htm">human race</a> an influence more deep and lasting, more widespread, or on the whole more beneficent.</p>

<p>It remains to say a word on the controversy carried on during the present generation concerning St. Anthony and the <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a>. In 1877 Weingarten denied the <a href="02033b.htm">Athanasian</a> authorship and the historical character of the <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a>, which he pronounced to be a mere romance; he held that up to 340 there were no <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, and that therefore the <a href="04636c.htm">dates</a> of the "real" Anthony had to be shifted nearly a century. Some imitators in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> went still further and questioned, even denied, that St. Anthony had ever existed. To anyone conversant with the literature of <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the notion that the fictitious hero of a novel could ever have come to occupy Anthony's position position in <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> history can appear nothing less than a fantastic paradox. As a matter of fact these theories are abandoned on all hands; the <a href="../fathers/2811.htm">Life</a> is received as certainly historical in substances, and as probably by <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and the traditional account of <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> origins is reinstated in its great outlines. The episode is now chiefly of interest as a curious example of a theory that was broached and became the fashion, and then was completely abandoned, all within a single generation. (on the controversy see Butler, op. cit. Part I, 215-228, Part II, ix-xi).</p>
