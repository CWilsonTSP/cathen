<p>(PRAGENSIS). An archdiocese in Bohemia.</p>

<p>From about the middle of the sixth century Slavonic tribes advancing into <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> drove the Marcomanni to the borders of the country. The <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a> soon came under the influence of the Carolingian civilization. In 845 Czech princes and their warriors appeared at the Court of Louis the German at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, where they were <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> on the octave of Epiphany (13 January) by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Although many German <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> now came into <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> to aid in the spread of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the land soon fell under the dominion of <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, which was naturally followed by the appearance of Slavonic <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from Great <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. It is supposed, though it cannot be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>, that the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Duke Boriwoi was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Methodius, the apostle to the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. The first Duke of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> of whom there is historic <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> that he was a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> is Boriwoi's son, Spitigniew, who in 895 allied himself to Carlmann's son, Arnulf of Carinthia. Spitigniew's brother and successor, Wratislaw I, built the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George upon the Hradschin (castle hill) at Prague. His wife Drahomira, who belonged to a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> Slavonic <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, though probably <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, was not <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> at heart. Their sons, St. Wenceslaus and Boleslaw I the Cruel, were still minors at the death of their father. The most important factor in the history of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> at this time was the opposition between the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> or national party and the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> or German party. Wenceslaus hoped to gain everything from the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>. Desiring to build a church upon the Hradschin he requested permission from the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> who came to the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The church was dedicated to St. Vitus, as Henry I the Saxon of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> had sent a present of a precious <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of this saint. The struggle between <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> divided even the ducal <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. On 28 September, 935, Wenceslaus was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> by his brother Boleslaw and his accomplices at the door of the church in Altbunzlau. Yet Boleslaw found himself <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to rule in a manner favourable to the Christian-German party. Much was done for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> by his children, Boleslaw II the Pious, Milada, and Dubravka. Boleslaw II desired to be independent of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters and sought to have Prague made a <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. <a href="11355a.htm">Otto II</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> aided this effort, for he regarded it as a protection against <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. <a href="08427a.htm">John XIII</a> consented on condition that the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> should be used. Milada, sister of the duke, who lived in a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of Maria <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> of the Abbey of St. George on the Hradschin, the first monastic foundation in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> then formed a part of the <a href="12657a.htm">Diocese of Ratisbon</a>, suffragan of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. <a href="15682b.htm">St. Wolfgang</a> drew up the charter for the new diocese and it was made a suffragan of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Thietmar, a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> from <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> who had a thorough <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Slavonic language, was appointed (973) the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Prague. The new diocese included: <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Silesia including Cracow, and Lusatia; Moravia, western <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> as far as the Waag and Danube Rivers; Lower <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> between Taja and Kamp. In Moravia, Vracen was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a>, second <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Prague, appointed by <a href="11355a.htm">Otto II</a> at <a href="15360a.htm">Verona</a>, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Willigis of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. He <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Moravia a stern censor of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, striving to suppress <a href="04207a.htm">concubinage</a> among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="02564a.htm">polygamy</a>, and <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> practices, but, <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to withdraw, took refuge in a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the request of the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> he returned with twelve <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, among them Christinus, Benedictus, and Matth&aelig;us. In 993 Adalbert founded for these <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> the first <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> for men in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, that of Brewnow near Prague (St. Margaret), and appointed his teacher Radla (Anastasius) <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Two years later Adalbert was again <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> now dissolved his connexion with Prague and Adalbert died (997) a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Severus, sixth <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Prague, was one of the retinue of Duke Bretislaw Achilles, who brought (1039) the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> from <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> to Prague. The ambitious Bretislaw wished to be independent of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. It was his intention to make use of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sazawa, founded in 1037, with a Greek-Slavonic liturgy, as a national church; he appointed St. Procopius the first <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of this <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. A part of his plan was that Bishop Severus, as the lawful successor of St. Methodius, should receive the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a>. As, however, the Polish Church complained of the <a href="14564b.htm">robbery</a> of the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a>, the duke and <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> became involved in an investigation and they were condemned to found a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> as penance. Bretislaw established the collegiate chapter of Altbunzlau in 1096 and two years later founded Raigern, the first <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. Raigern was united with Brewnow. The next duke, Spitihnew, founded (1058) the collegiate <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Stephen at <a href="09141a.htm">Leitmeritz</a>. The Slavonic <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, who were replaced by Latin <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, were transferred to the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Vesprim, Vyehrad, <a href="04558b.htm">Csan&aacute;d</a>, and <a href="01677a.htm">Arad</a>. <a href="11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> granted the duke the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of "the <a href="10404a.htm">mitre</a>" (a cloak) for an annual payment of one hundred marks; this <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> was regarded as a sign of royal dignity. Spitihnew's brothers, Wratislaw II, who succeeded him and Jaromir (Gebhard), who was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Prague, were men very different in character. In 1063 the duke gave his consent to the establishment of the <a href="11247a.htm">Diocese of Olm&uuml;tz</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Prague received compensation for what he lost in <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> and fiefs, and a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> named John, belonging to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Brewnow, was appointed first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>. The new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> had much to suffer from Jaromir, who attacked and ill-treated him in his episcopal residence. <a href="01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> sent to Prague the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> Rudolphus, who held there a synodal diet at which, however, Jaromir did not appear. Jaromir was declared to be deposed; <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> summoned the contending <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> synod of 1074, Jaromir expressed his regret for his ill-usage of John but was unwilling to yield the fief of Podvin. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> now wrote to Wratislaw that if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> he should drive Jaromir away by force.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the struggle over Investitures Wratislaw II and Jaromir supported <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>. After the death of Bishop John, Jaromir secured the union of <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a> with Prague (1085-91), as his brother had received the title of king from <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> and consequently was entirely on the king's side. Wratislaw soon deserted the emperor and gave Olm&uuml;tz to his court <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> Wecel (Andreas I), who was made <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Jaromir died at <a href="06721b.htm">Gran</a>, where he was preparing to fight his rival. After Wecel's death <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> invested the canon Andreas at <a href="09611b.htm">Mantua</a> with the ring and <a href="04515c.htm">crozier</a>, but he was not <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> until two years later. At <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> (1138) Bishop Henry of <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, called Zdik after his native town, entered the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensian Order</a> in the church of the Holy Sepulchre at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. On his return, he persuaded the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Prague, John I, to bring <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> from Steinhof near Cologne and establish them at Strahow. Bitter contention arose between Zdik and his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> when the princes of <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a> rebelled against Wladislaw II, Duke of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. Zdik adhered to the duke, and was, therefore, <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee to Prague; after giving warnings in vain he placed the rebels and the land under bann and <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>, which were later removed by the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> Guido. He deposed <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who had <a href="04207a.htm">concubines</a>. Ordinations were only permitted on definite conditions. Wladislaw supported the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> so vigorously that it was said of him that he had enforced <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> chastity throughout <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. Wladislaw also granted Podvin in perpetuity to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and bestowed on him the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to have a mint. Lucius II invited Zdik to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On the way he was attacked and robbed near Boscowicz, and escaped to Leitomischl. In 1143, Bishop Otto settled <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> from Waldsassen at Sedlek. When the <a href="04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a> was preached Bishop Henry of <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a> was the subdelegate of <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> for <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Moravia. Henry himself went to <a href="12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, but soon returned unsuccessful. In 1156, the <a href="07477a.htm">Order of St. John of Jerusalem</a> was introduced in the hospice of St. Mary near the Prague bridge. <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick I Barbarossa</a> in 1158 made Wladislaw a king in return for his aid against <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. The <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to crown the king was assigned to the Bishops of Prague and <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>. The <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> king and Bishop Daniel I supported Frederick in his bitter struggle with <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. The king and <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> were <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and when in 1167 the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> died the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Prague refused to recite the Office for the Dead. It was during the quarrel between Duke Premysl Ottokar I and Bishop Henry Bretislaw that Kacim, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> at Prague in 1193 but forgot the <a href="07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>. Two years later his successor, Engelbert, performed this part of the rite, but the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> Peter suspended the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> and in 1197 the entire <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> had to be repeated. At the renewed <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> insisted positively upon the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity. The candidates rebelled at this and Peter had to leave the church. Not long after, the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> succeeded in making a synod pass his demands, and the prosperity of the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Church rapidly increased. About this time St. Hrozata founded the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Abbey of Tepl, which he entered.</p>

<p>Premysl Ottokar I made <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> a hereditary kingdom, and independent of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; hence the Bishops of Prague and Olm&uuml;tz no longer received investiture from the emperor but from the King of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was to elect the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Ottokar wished to make Prague an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> with Olm&uuml;tz as its suffragan. <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, however, had all the less reason to be gracious to the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> king as Ottokar had just changed his political adherence from <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> to Philip of Swabia, against the wishes of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The first king who received <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> by inheritance desired to annul the immunity of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and take the church <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> for himself, while Bishop Andreas wished to enforce the decrees of the fourth Synod of Laberno. The king would not permit this. Andreas placed <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> under an <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>, the king cut off all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> revenues. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> commanded that Robert of <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, who, in spite of the <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>, had celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> at Prague, should be punished. With the aid of a <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> a fairly satisfactory agreement was reached (Concord of Skacenze, 1220). One of Ottokar's daughters, <a href="01213a.htm">St. Agnes</a>, corresponded with <a href="04004a.htm">St. Clare of Assisi</a>, and founded the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Clare, called later St. Agnes, in 1234 at Prague; as <em>soror major</em> Agnes was the head of it. She also aided the foundation of the Order of the <a href="08671a.htm">Knights of the Cross</a> of the Red Star at Prague. While on his journey to <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> <a href="07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a> brought <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> to Prague, who established themselves in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Clement. Wenceslaus granted to the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. James in the Altstadt, Prague. <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> nobles who went to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> became acquainted there with the <a href="14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a>. They introduced them into <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and the order flourished to such extent that in 1240 <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> became a national <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> and Prague had two commanderies, the Temple and St. Laurence. Church life flourished in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> at this era; the country seemed "to breathe nothing but <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>". King Wenceslaus remained a firm adherent of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> even after his deposition by the Council of Lyons. An <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> was pronounced over <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Bishop Nicholas of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> was suspended. Mass was only celebrated in the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and there behind closed doors without the ringing of bells. For some time, the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> had been fighting against the natives of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In 1225 Premysl Ottokar II assumed the cross; he wished to gain the favour of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. The name of the city of K&ouml;nigsberg preserves the memory of the king, who was called not only the Golden but also the Iron. About this time (1256) the first <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> appeared in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; the <a href="06089c.htm">Flagellants</a> came from <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> (see <a href="06089c.htm">FLAGELLANTS</a>). In gratitude for the successful issue of his struggle with B&eacute;la IV (battle of Kressenbrunn) Premysl Ottokar II in 1263 founded the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Goldenkron, so named because of a <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Crown of Thorns set in gold that had been given by St. Louis. Ottokar's viceroy in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Peter of Rosenberg, founded the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Hohenfurt in expiation of his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and for the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of his ancestors. Bishop John III of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> attended the Council of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1276, which had been summoned by the king. The council's nineteen canons treat of the behaviour of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, of the penal power of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and the relations between <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> were to be distinguished by pointed hats, and on <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> they were not to appear in public. Bishop Bruno of <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a> had brought to Ottokar from the Council of Lyons a letter written by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> calling upon him to support the election of Rudolph of Hapsburg as Emperor of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. When Ottokar recommenced, he was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; consequently it was not until eighteen years after he had been killed in battle that he was buried in <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> ground in the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Prague. During this time, it is said, there were not less than twenty-one thousand <a href="02389c.htm">Beghards</a> in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The country was also disturbed by off-shoots of the <a href="15527b.htm">Waldensians</a> who called themselves "Apostolic Brethren", and "Brethren of the Holy Spirit". They even wished to have wives and <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> in common and sought to live underground. They claimed that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> did not trouble Himself about what happened under the earth and so have been called <em>Grubenheimer</em>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Bishop John IV of Prague had taken in preparing the decrees concerning the dispute between the Mendicant Orders and the <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, which were drawn up at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. After his return, he desired to execute these decrees. The Mendicants were only to preach in their own churches and not there during the service at the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church; they were not in any way to encroach upon the pastoral work, and must have episcopal authority to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a>. The Mendicants appealed to their exemption and made loud complaint that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> denied the validity of confessions heard by them. The <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of Prague announced that they would publish the decisions of the Council of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in their churches. The Mendicants also made their preparations. Bishop John established the Court of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> as the council had desired. When in the course of a year, however, this court delivered to the State fourteen <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> who were burned at the stake, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> sent the Inquisitors away and opened their <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a>. Complaint having been made against him, he had to go to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and after an investigation of eleven years he finally returned home. After the suppression of the <a href="14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a>, their lands were given by King John of Luxemburg to other orders of <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>, and he substituted <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> founded by him. He also established the first <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Maria Garten am Smichow, and at Raudnitz a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>. The increasing prosperity of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> reached its most flourishing period during the reign of Charles IV. The emperor had been <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at the French court; his teacher and friend Peter de Rosi&egrave;res was now <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>. It was, therefore, not difficult for Charles to obtain from him in 1344 a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> raising Prague to an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, with the suffragan Dioceses of <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a> and of the newly founded Leitomischl. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was to anoint and crown the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> kings; thus he was the <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The first <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was St. Ernst of Pardubitz, the advisor of Charles IV in his great undertakings. Charles brought Matthias of <a href="01752c.htm">Arras</a> from <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to Prague so that, with the aid of Peter Parler of Gm&uuml;nd (in Suabia), he might build the beautiful Cathedral of St. Vitus, the <a href="14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of which had been laid by the emperor's father. It is yet unfinished. The emperor even included his crown among the treasures with which he thought to enrich the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; from that time it adorned the head of St. Wenceslaus. The crown jewels were kept in the Castle of Karlstein built by Arras. The <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Castle Karlstein was built in the shape of a cross; its walls were inlaid with <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> garnets on a gold ground, so that the lights of the altar were reflected many hundred times. At Emaus Charles founded an <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> for <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, who were to use the <a href="06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> Liturgy in celebrating <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>. The foundation in which Charles was most interested was the <a href="12342a.htm">University of Prague</a>, established in 1348, the oldest German <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was to be its chancellor (<em>Protector studiorum et Cancellarius</em>). In 1349 Archbishop Ernst held the celebrated provincial synod that defined the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <em>Correctores Cleri</em> were provided who were to supervise the carrying out of the <em>Statuta Ernesti</em> and to supply what was lacking.</p>

<p>Now began a religious movement that plunged <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and the surrounding countries into <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, seriously retarded the growth of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and left the See of Prague vacant for one hundred and forty years (1421-1561). For details of this period, see <a href="07585a.htm">HUS AND HUSSITES</a>; <a href="04288a.htm">COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE</a>: <em>The Repression of Heresy</em>. These hundred years of religious unrest had prepared a fruitful soil for the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Matthias preached <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> doctrines openly on the public roads; Thomas M&uuml;nzer and Gallus Cahera preached them in Prague. King Ferdinand, who had taken up his residence on the Hradschin, checked the growth of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, but the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> over the Hungarian throne and the struggle with the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> impeded his efforts. The Utraquist Consistory of Prague obtained in Mistopol an administrator who was even inclined to <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. During the Smalkaldic <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> the <a href="02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a> united with the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. After the battle of M&uuml;hlberg (1547), the religious reformers, driven out of the cities of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, went to <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, which were added by the <a href="02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a> as a third province to <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Moravia. The greatest aid received by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> came from the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1556, <a href="11756c.htm">Peter Canisius</a> brought the first twelve <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to St. Clement's at Prague; their college there, called Clementinum, ranked with the Carolinum. In 1561, Prague again received an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="03020a.htm">Anton Brus</a> of M&uuml;glitz in <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. At the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> sought to gain the cup for the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, which <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> granted in 1567 for the countries ruled by Ferdinand. As, however, the result expected from this concession did not appear, the Utraquists becoming more largely <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> recalled the permission. Maximilian II was more favourable to <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. In 1567 he annulled the <em>Compacta</em> for the benefit of the Utraquists. Not only the Utraquistic <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but also all Utraquists (<a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>) were to be tolerated. At the Diet of Prague they demanded the introduction of the Augsburg Confession. The "Bohemian Confession" was drawn up in twenty-five articles; it maintained <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> teachings, but was indefinite on the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Eucharist. The administrator of the consistory was to ordain their <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> also, while fifteen defenders were to be added to the consistory. Thus the imperial cities which had been Utraquistic rapidly became <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>. At Prague three <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were soon formed. When Rudolph II shut himself up in the castle on the Hradschin the archdukes of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> selected Matthias as the head of the Hapsburg dynasty. The <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> estates, taking advantage of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> quarrel of the Hapsburgs, elected a directory and raised an army. They remained indeed loyal to Rudolph, but forced from him in 1609 the royal charter (<em>Majest&auml;tsbrief</em>), which confirmed the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Confession, opened the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> to the evangelical estates, granted them the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to elect defensors, and also permitted the three secular estates of lords, <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>, and imperial cities to build <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. Rudolph finally abdicated and in 1611 Cardinal Dietrichstein of <a href="11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a> <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> Matthias King of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> (1611-9). Contrary to the regulations of the royal charter granted by Rudolph, subjects of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Prague built a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church at Klostergrab and subjects of the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Braunau one at Braunau. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> commanded these to be closed, and when the Emperor Matthias sanctioned this order the result was the Third Defenestration of Prague, with which the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> began. A government of thirty directors was formed, and the head of the Protestant Union and of the German <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, Frederick V, Elector of the Palatinate, was elected King of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The Cathedral of Prague was arranged for <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> services; altars were torn down, pictures and <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> destroyed. The court preacher Scultetus drew up an independent liturgy for <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>.</p>

<p>A sovereign has seldom begun his reign under greater difficulties than Ferdinand II (1619-37). The insurgents under Thurn were at the gates of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; within the city the non-Catholic estates made common cause with the besiegers. Ferdinand, however, never yielded. After the battle of the White Mountain (1620) he took more severe measures against the disturbers; they were driven out of the country, the royal charter that had been the source of so much disorder was annulled, and a system of government introduced in 1627 that among other things made the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> the first estate. It granted the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> seats and votes in the diet (the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bench) and the title of <em>Primas regni</em> to the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Only the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was to be permitted. An imperial commission of reform ("dragonnades", "saviours") was to traverse the country purging it of preachers, <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> schoolmasters and books. Thirty-six thousand <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> were welcomed in neighbouring countries, but with all this the country was not made thoroughly <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Many conformed only externally and the varying phases of the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>, for which in the end religion was merely the excuse, constantly favoured <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. In the Peace of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648), however, Ferdinand III did not allow himself to be dictated to. During the period when princes were absolute rulers, events protected the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> against fresh attacks. Pastoral care, instruction, and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration were improved. The Montscratines, <a href="13588a.htm">Piarists</a>, <a href="14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, and <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> were introduced into the country, the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> was founded, and the new Dioceses of <a href="09141a.htm">Leitmeritz</a> (1655) and K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz (1665) were erected. The old <a href="12342a.htm">University of Prague</a> and the Clementinum, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a>, were united into the Caroline-Ferdinand University. The tax of fifteen kreuzers on salt, either mined in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> or imported, was applied to Church purposes, the St. Wenceslaus fund was used to distribute good books, and the Emeritus fund was employed to aid poor <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. For two years from 1712 the churches even in Prague were closed on account of the plague. In 1729 the <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="08467a.htm">St. John Nepomucene</a> was celebrated with great festivities. The power of the sovereign over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was introduced by <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers at first only assumed this position as regards their <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> subjects. In the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, however, they began to exercise this power also as regards their <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects. As the maintenance of religion (the <a href="04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>) was their work and they obtained the chief patronage of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, a State Church was the natural consequence. Even in the reign of <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> edicts were issued concerning <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. No one could take the <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> of an order until fully twenty-four (1770); monastic <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a> were to be suppressed (1771). As the basis of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> instruction were to be used: Sagan's Catechism (1772), Riegger's "Institutiones jurisprudenti&aelig; ecclesiastic&aelig;", and Rautenstrauch's "Synopsis juris ecclesiastici". Trumpets and drums could no longer be used in the churches; in the lessons of the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a> for the feast of <a href="06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a> the places concerning the power of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to depose kings were to be omitted. Parish <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were expressly forbidden to speak abusively of the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the country. Within ten years <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> issued sixty-two hundred <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> orders of the court, and ordinances. Even what was good showed marks of haste; <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and ordinances contradicted one another. When in 1781 the patent of toleration was issued quite a number who had been <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in secret now appeared as such openly. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In c&oelig;na Domini' and <a href="15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> were to be suppressed. It was forbidden to study <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Roman dignities and titles could only be assumed after obtaining permission of the ruler. A general <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> was established at Prague, where both <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and candidates for the orders were to be <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a>. Even the number of Masses to be held in a church and the number of candles that could be used at such services were prescribed by law; the <a href="09286a.htm">litany</a> of the Trinity was forbidden "on account of various additions's. Many <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed, the remaining ones were regulated by the State, and fell into decay. One good measure of the emperor was, that he formed a fund for the maintenance of religion from the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the suppressed <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and used it to increase the number of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In this way <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> founded eighty-one <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and three hundred and fourteen dependent churches in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. He also established the <a href="03034b.htm">Diocese of Budweis</a>.</p>

<p>Joseph's brother Leopold II soon changed conditions. The general <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were abolished, there was no further <a href="10453a.htm">suppression of monasteries</a>, and books for <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> instruction were submitted to the censorship of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Francis II was a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> ruler, who took a serious view of his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> in regard to <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> and religious <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, but for nearly a generation the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> claimed all the strength and energy of the Government. In the meantime both <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> grew more and more accustomed to the Josephine reforms of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Were any <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> concessions made the Josephinists raised a cry over the unjustifiable demands of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the unheard of concessions of the Government. One of the results of the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> was the demand of the Government for the silver plate in 1806, 1809 etc., when all the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> silver not absolutely <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> went to the mint. In return, the churches received from the Government an acknowledgment of the <a href="04663b.htm">indebtedness</a>. During this period the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="02643c.htm">Bernhard Bolzano</a>, a <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writer and professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="12342a.htm">University of Prague</a>, wrote: "Lehrbuch der Religionswissenschaft" (4 vols.); "Wissenschaftslehre"; "Logic" (4 vols.); "Athanasia oder die Gr&uuml;nde f&uuml;r die Unsterblichkeit der Seele"; "Erbauungsreden an die akademische Jugend" (4 vols.); "Ueber die Perfektibilit&auml;t des Katholizismus". The authorities were suspicious of him on account of his teachings, but his <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Prince von Salm, protected him. In 1820 he was removed from his professorship and died in 1848. In 1848 Alois, Freiherr von Schrenk became Prince <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Prague. On 15 March, the emperor announced his intention of granting a constitution. Schrenk may have thought that "freedom is a great good for those who <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> how to use it". On 22 March he issued a censure, as some <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, forgetting their sacred calling, turned the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> into a political platform. The freedom gained should rather be the signal for greater activity. His address at the <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> festival, posted on the streets in Czech and German, sought to allay the hostility to the Jewish population. A meeting of thirty-five <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, members of orders, <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, professors, and <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, called together without asking the consent of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by F. Nahlowsky, principal of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for Wends, Upper Lusatia, was held at the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> on 18 and 22 May. In his address Nahlowsky expressed his opinion concerning the unsuitability of the unessential system of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>; the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> should be thoroughly reformed. The proceedings of this assembly even appeared in print. Naturally both the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and Bishop Hille of <a href="09141a.htm">Leitmeritz</a>, of which diocese Nahlowsky was a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, expressed "their deep sorrow". Late in August the pamphlet issued by the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> episcopate appeared. The contents discussed the two questions: What is the position of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> towards the State in general and what are the special <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, liturgy, and administration. The strain he had undergone shattered the health of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and he died in March, 1849, at the age of forty-seven. His successor was <a href="13595a.htm">Cardinal Schwarzenberg</a>. The present prince archbishop is Leo Cardinal von Skrbensky.</p>
