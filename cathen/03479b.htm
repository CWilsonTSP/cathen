<p>(PIETRO DI MURRONE.)</p>

<p>Born 1215, in the <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> province of Moline; elected at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a> 5 July, 1294; <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, 29 August; abdicated at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 13 Dec., 1294; died in the castle of Fumone, 19 May, 1296. He was of <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> parentage, became a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> at the age of seventeen, and was eventually <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of solitude led him first into the wilderness of Monte Morone in the Abruzzi, whence his surname, and later into the wilder recesses of Mt. Majella. He took for his model the Baptist. His hair-cloth was roughened with knots; a chain of iron encompassed his emaciated frame; he <a href="05789c.htm">fasted</a> every day except Sunday; each year he kept four <a href="09152a.htm">Lents</a>, passing three of them on bread and water; the entire day and a great part of the night he <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and labour. As generally happens in the case of saintly <a href="01462b.htm">anchorites</a>, Peter's desire for solitude was not destined to be gratified. Many kindred spirits gathered about him eager to imitate his rule of life, and before his death there were thirty- six <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, numbering 600 religious, bearing his <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> name (Celestini). The order was approved, as a branch of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, by <a href="15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>, in 1264. This congregation of (Benedictine) <a href="16020a.htm">Celestines</a> must not be confounded with other (Franciscan) <a href="16020a.htm">Celestines</a>, extreme Spirituals whom <a href="03477c.htm">Pope Celestine</a> permitted (1294) to live as <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> according to the Rule of St. Francis, but were pendent of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> superiors. In gratitude they called themselves after the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (<em>Pauperes eremit&aelig; Domini Celestine</em>), but were dissolved and dispersed (1302) by <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, whose legitimacy the Spirituals contested [Heimbucher, Orden und Kongregationen (2nd ed. Paderborn, 1907); I, 280; II, 360]. In 1284, Pietro, weary of the cares of government, appointed a certain Robert as his vicar and plunged again into the depths of the wilderness. It would be well if some <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholar would devote some time to a thorough investigation of his relations to the extreme spiritual party of that age; for though it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> did not approve of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> tenets held by the leaders, it is equally <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that the fanatics, during his life and after his death, made copious use of his name.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In July, 1294, his <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises were suddenly interrupted by a scene unparalleled in <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. Three eminent dignitaries, accompanied by an immense multitude of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>, ascended the mountain, announced that Pietro had been chosen <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by unanimous vote of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> and humbly begged him to accept the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>. Two years and three months had elapsed since the death of <a href="11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> (4 Apr., 1292) without much prospect that the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a> would unite upon a candidate. Of the twelve <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> who composed the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> six were Romans, four <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a> and two French. The factious spirit of <a href="07056c.htm">Guelph and Ghibelline</a>, which was then epidemic in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, divided the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>, as well as the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, into two hostile parties of the Orsini and the Colonna, neither of which could outvote the other. A personal visit to <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, in the spring of 1294, of Charles II of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, who needed the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority in order to regain <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, only exasperated the affair, hot words being exchanged between the Angevin monarch and Cardinal Gaetani, at that time the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> leader of the Colonna, later, as <a href="02662a.htm">Pope Boniface VIII</a>, their bitter enemy. When the situation seemed hopeless, Cardinal Latino Orsini admonished the fathers that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> had revealed to a saintly <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> that if the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> did not perform their <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> within four months, He would visit the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> with severe chastisement. All <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> that he referred to Pietro di Murrone. The proposition was seized upon by the exhausted <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> and the election was made unanimous. Pietro heard of his elevation with tears; but, after a brief <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, obeyed what seemed the clear voice of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, commanding him to sacrifice his personal inclination on the altar of the public welfare. Flight was impossible, even if he contemplated it; for no sooner did the news of this extraordinary event spread abroad than multitudes (numbered at 200,000) flocked about him. His elevation was particularly welcome to the Spirituals, who saw in it the realization of current prophecies that the reign of the Holy Spirit ruling through the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> was at hand; and they proclaimed him the first legitimate <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> since Constantine's donation of wealth and worldly power to "the first rich father" (Inferno, Canto XIX). King Charles of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, hearing of the election of his subject, hastened with his son Charles Martel, titular King of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, ostensibly to present his homage to the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, in reality to take the simple old man into honourable custody. Had Charles known how to preserve moderation in exploiting his good luck, this windfall might have brought him incalculable benefits; as it was, he ruined everything by excessive <a href="02148b.htm">greed</a>.</p>

<p>In reply to the request of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, that he should come to <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a> to be <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a>, Pietro, at the instigation of Charles, summoned the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> to meet him at <a href="01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, a frontier town of the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. Reluctantly they came, and one by one, Gaetani being the last to appear. Seated on an <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> ass, the rope held by two monarchs, the new pontiff proceeded to <a href="01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, and, although only three of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> had arrived, the king ordered him to be <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a>, a <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> which had to be repeated in traditional form some days later, the only instance of a double <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>. Cardinal Latino was so grief-stricken at the course which affairs were evidently taking that he fell sick and died. Pietro took the name of Celestine V. Urged by the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to cross over into the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, Celestine, again at the behest of the king, ordered the entire <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> to repair to <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>. It is wonderful how many serious mistakes the simple old man crowded into five short months. We have no full register of them, because his official acts were annulled by his successor. On the 18th of September he created twelve new <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, seven of whom were French, and the rest, with one possible exception, <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitans</a>, thus paving the road to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and the Great Schism. Ten days later he embittered the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> by renewing the rigorous law of <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, regulating the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>, which <a href="01159a.htm">Adrian V</a> had suspended. He is said to have appointed a young son of Charles to the important See of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, but no trace of such appointment appears in <a href="06376a.htm">Gams</a> or Eubel. At <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> on his way to <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, he strove to force the Celestine hermit-rule on the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>; they humoured him while he was with them. At <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a> he created the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, without observing any of the traditional forms. Meanwhile he scattered privileges and offices with a lavish hand. Refusing no one, he was found to have granted the same place or <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> to three or four rival suitors; he also granted favours in blank. In consequence, the affairs of the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> fell into extreme disorder. Arrived in <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, he took up his abode in a single apartment of the Castel Nuovo, and on the approach of <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a> had a little cell built on the model of his beloved hut in the Abruzzi. But he was ill at ease. Affairs of State took up time that ought to be devoted to exercises of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. He feared that his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> was in danger. The thought of abdication seems to have occurred simultaneously to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and to his discontented <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, whom he rarely consulted.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>That the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> originated with Cardinal Gaetani the latter vigorously denied, and maintained that he originally opposed it. But the serious canonical <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> arose: Can a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> resign? As he has no superior on earth, who is authorized to accept his resignation? The solution of the question was reserved to the trained canonist, Cardinal Gaetani, who, basing his conclusion on common sense and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> right to self-preservation, decided affirmatively.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice how curtly, when he became <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, he dispatches the delicate subject on which the validity of his claim to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> depended. In the "Liber Sextus" I, vii, 1, he issued the following <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>: "Whereas some curious <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, arguing on things of no great expediency, and rashly seeking, against the teaching of the Apostle, to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> more than it is meet to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>, have seemed, with little forethought, to raise an anxious <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>, whether the <a href="12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>, especially when he recognizes himself incapable of ruling the Universal Church and of bearing the burden of the Supreme Pontificate, can validly renounce the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and its burden and <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>: Pope Celestine V, Our predecessor, whilst still presiding over the government of the aforesaid Church, wishing to cut off all the matter for hesitation on the subject, having deliberated with his brethren, the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, of whom We were one, with the concordant counsel and assent of Us and of them all, by Apostolic authority established and decreed, that the <a href="12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> may freely resign. We, therefore, lest it should happen that in course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> this enactment should fall into oblivion, and the aforesaid <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> should revive the discussion, have placed it among other constitutions <em>ad perpetuam rei memoriam</em> by the advice of our brethren."</p>

<p>When the report spread that Celestine contemplated resigning, the excitement in <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> was intense. King Charles, whose arbitrary course had brought things to this crisis, organized a determined opposition. A huge procession of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> surrounded the castle, and with tears and <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> implored the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to continue his rule. Celestine, whose mind was not yet clear on the subject, returned an evasive answer, whereupon the multitude chanted the <a href="14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> and withdrew. A week later (13 December) Celestine's resolution was irrevocably fixed; summoning the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> on that day, he read the constitution mentioned by <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a> in the "Liber Sextus", announced his resignation, and proclaimed the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> free to proceed to a new election. After the lapse of the nine days enjoined by the legislation of <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> entered the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>, and the next day Benedetto Gaetani was proclaimed Pope as <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. After revoking many of the provisions made by Celestine, <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a> brought his predecessor, now in the dress of a <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a>, with him on the road to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was forced to retain him in custody, lest an inimical use should be made of the simple old man. Celestine yearned for his cell in the Abruzzi, managed to effect his escape at San Germano, and to the great <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> of his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> reappeared among them at Majella. <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a> ordered his arrest; but Celestine evaded his pursuers for several months by wandering through the woods and mountains. Finally, he attempted to cross the Adriatic to Greece; but, driven back by a tempest, and captured at the foot of Mt. Gargano, he was delivered into the hands of <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a>, who confined him closely in a narrow room in the tower of the castle of Fumone near <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a> (Analecta Bollandiana, 1897, XVI, 429-30). Here, after nine months passed in <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, closely watched but attended by two of his own religious, though rudely treated by the guards, he ended his extraordinary career in his eighty-first year. That <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a> treated him harshly, and finally cruelly <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> him, is a <a href="03190c.htm">calumny</a>. Some years after his <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> by <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a> in 1313, his remains were transferred from <a href="06042b.htm">Ferentino</a> to the church of his order at <a href="01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, where they are still the object of great veneration. His <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 19 May.</p>
