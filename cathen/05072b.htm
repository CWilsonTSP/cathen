<p>(<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>docere</em>, to teach)</p>

<p>The title of an authorized teacher. In this general sense the term occurs in the O.T.; the "doctors" are mentioned with the "princes and ancients" (<a href="../bible/deu029.htm#vrs10">Deuteronomy 29:10</a>; <a href="../bible/deu031.htm#vrs28">31:28</a>), and Azarias prophesies (<a href="../bible/2ch015.htm#vrs3">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>) that "many days shall pass in <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>, without the <a href="06608a.htm">true God</a>, and without a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> a teacher, and without the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>" (absque sacerdote doctore, et absque lege). It was the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of these doctors to expound the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, and this they performed at the time of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was found in the Temple "in the midst of the doctors" (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs46">Luke 2:46</a>). Another meeting of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> with the "doctors of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>" is recorded in <a href="../bible/luk005.htm">Luke 5:17</a>. The later Jewish teachers also received the title (<em>doctor gemaricus, doctor mischnicus</em> &#151; see Talmud). Under the New Law the doctors are those who have received a special gift or <em>charisma</em> (see <a href="03588e.htm">CHARISMATA</a>) such as the "prophets and doctors" of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at Antioch (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs1">Acts 13:1</a>), and of whom <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says that "God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a>, thirdly doctors (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs28">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs11">Ephesians 4:11</a>). <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> speaks of himself as a doctor of the <a href="06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs7">1 Timothy 2:7</a>), and <em>Doctor gentium</em> is one of the titles given him in the liturgy. In the early Church, teachers in the <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were known as <em>doctores audientium</em> (Cyprian, Ep. xxix, ed. Hartel); and finally, in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, some of the most illustrious <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> were designated as "Doctors of the Church".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The use of <em>Doctor</em> as an academic title dates from the founding of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>. Before these were regularly organized, any teacher who gathered about him a number of students was a doctor, <em>dominus</em>, or <em>magister</em>. During the first half of the twelfth century, the title <em>Doctor</em> acquired a more special significance, though it still implied personal excellence rather than official position. The "Four Doctors" who succeeded <a href="08168a.htm">Irnerius</a> at Bologna were the distinguished jurists, Martinus (died before 1166), Bulgarus (died 1166), Hugo (died 1168), and Jacobus (died 1178). But when the doctors formed a <em>collegium</em> they prescribed conditions on which other <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> might become members of the teaching body, and thus laid the foundation of the system of academic degrees. The doctorate was first granted in <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> (<em>doctores legum</em>), later in canon law (<em>doctores decretorum</em>), and, during the thirteenth century, in medicine, grammar, <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a>, and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The doctorate in music was conferred at Oxford and Cambridge in the fifteenth century. For graduates in arts and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <em>magister</em> was more generally employed than <em>doctor</em>, but for a long time these titles were synonymous. The <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, adopting the usage of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at first designated teachers of law as doctors, and professors of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> as masters; but in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> the former title was given to all the superior faculties, and the latter was reserved for grammar and arts. In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <em>doctor</em> and <em>magister</em> were interchangeable (Kaufmann, "Geschichte" etc., II, 268 sqq.), and though the mastership is no longer conferred as a separate degree, a trace of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> practice is still found in the diploma which styles its recipient "Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Arts".</p>

<p>Bologna at first conferred only the doctorate, but <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> very soon introduced the preparatory degrees of baccalaureate and licentiate. Later, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, the licentiate was granted in the Italian <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> also at the first examination (<em>privata</em>); but this merely implied permission to proceed to the second, more formal, examination (<em>publica</em>) in which the <em>licentia docendi</em> was given. At <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the licentiate meant a real authorization to teach, besides being a pre-requisite for admission to the final examination (<em>inceptio</em>) at which the doctorate was conferred. There was a corresponding difference in the length of the course for the degree. Bologna required six years of study for the doctorate in canon law, and seven or eight for the doctorate in <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>; the student might begin his course at the age of fourteen and become a doctor at twenty or twenty-one. At <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> drawn up in 1215 by the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">Legate</a> Robert de Cour&ccedil;on provided that no one should lecture in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> as a master unless he was thirty-five years of age, had studied for eight years, and taken a five-years' course in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. According to <a href="04719a.htm">Denifle</a> (Universit&auml;ten, 100-102), the eight years meant three years in arts and five years in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. (Cf. Rashdall, "Universities", I, 462 sqq.) At Oxford, candidates who had already taken the M. A. degree were required to study <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> seven years more for the licentiate. In medicine, M. A. candidates had a six-years' course for the doctorate. For the subjects required in these courses see <a href="15188a.htm">UNIVERSITY</a>. (Cf. Rasbdall, op. cit., II, 452 sq.)</p>

<p>In regard to examinations there seems to have been considerable leniency: at times they were reduced to mere formalities, at other times they were dispensed with. The degree was awarded by the chancellor on the advice of the regent masters of the faculty as to the candidate's fitness. The <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of inception was conducted by a regent; it consisted in the tradition of the book and ring, the imposition of the <a href="02577a.htm">biretta</a>, and the <a href="08663a.htm">kiss</a> of fellowship. At <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, however, the degree in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> was conferred by the chancellor himself, who placed the <a href="02577a.htm">biretta</a> upon the candidate's head with the words, "Incipiatis in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. <a href="01407b.htm">Amen</a>." Then followed a disputation (<em>aulica</em>) in which the chancellor, the masters, and one of the bachelors took part. It was customary also to hold, on the evening before inception, an elaborate disputation known as vesperi&oelig; (see, for details, <a href="03637a.htm">"Chartularium"</a>, II, App., p. 693).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Among the various doctorates, that in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> ranked first. It was no uncommon thing for those who had received the degree in the other faculties to take additional courses for the S. T. D. In the German <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, for instance, licentiates in law or medicine might become bachelors in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> after five years of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> study; they would then be <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to pursue the course prescribed for the other candidates. Conversely, <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> were sometimes permitted to follow courses in <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> and medicine. This privilege was granted to Bologna by <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (10 March, 1310) for a period of ten years but it applied only to <a href="11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> other than <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, religious, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> elect. It was renewed twice by <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1317 and 1330); but when the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> (1343-44) petitioned for an indefinite extension of the privilege, <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> refused. <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>, however, renewed it (30 June, 1360) for ten years (<a href="04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, op. cit., 209).</p>

<p>The chief significance of the doctorate lay in the fact that it authorized the recipient to teach everywhere without undergoing further examination &#151; <em>jus ubique docendi</em>. This prerogative developed gradually out of the <em>licentia docendi</em> which the degree itself implied, i.e. the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to teach in the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> which conferred the doctorate. But as the older <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, Bologna, Paris, and Oxford, grew in importance and attracted students from all parts, the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> naturally spread that their graduates had the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to teach everywhere. Subsequently, this authorization was expressly granted to newly founded <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>: by <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1233), and by <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> to Salamanca (1255). It was long, however, before the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> came to a mutual recognition of their degrees. <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> held tenaciously to its <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>; Oxford was more liberal, but would not permit a <a href="11480c.htm">Parisian</a> doctor to teach merely on the strength of his degree. The doctors themselves were not always anxious to exercise their prerogative; the teaching devolved in large measure upon the bachelors, and the masters were classified as regents (those who taught) and as nonregents, who were content with the prestige implied by their degree or were eager for other occupations.</p>

<p>The essential meaning of the doctorate as fixed by the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> is preserved in modern academic usage; the degree implies a qualification to teach. It has, however, undergone various modifications which are due partly to the development of the <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> and partly to changes in <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> theory and practice. The degree, Doctor of Laws, is often conferred as an honorary title. The doctorate in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or divinity, has been retained by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions as a degree to be given either after a course of study and an examination or as a distinction (<em>honoris causa</em>); while the tendency among non-Catholic <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> is to confer it only as an honorary degree. Of late the doctorate in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> has attained great importance, and its value has been enhanced as the result of stricter requirements. For this and for the other doctorates, research is now generally considered the principal qualification, and in consequence the candidate's work is becoming more specialized.</p>

<p>The influence of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in regard to the doctorate, especially in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, has been exerted in various ways, e.g. by authorizing <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> to confer the degree, by prescribing through <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a> the conditions for obtaining it, and by correcting abuses, notably laxity of requirements, which crept in from time to time. The historical details will be found in the article <a href="15188a.htm">UNIVERSITY</a>. Legislation concerning the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> side of the subject may be summarized as follows: &#151;</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>The power of creating doctors belongs to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; but he may, and often does, delegate it to <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and other institutions of learning. Charters granted by <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a> are valid; but to obtain canonical recognition, doctorates in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and canon law must be conferred in virtue of pontifical authorization.</li><li>The candidate for the degree must be a <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> and must subscribe to the profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> formulated by <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>. As a rule, only <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> receive the doctorate in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and canon law. It is not, however, <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the recipient should be in Sacred orders. Laymen as well as <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are allowed to appear as advocates before the Roman tribunals (Rota, Signatura) and they are required to have the doctorate at least in Canon law (Const. "Sapienti consilio", 29 June, 1908).</li><li>The doctoral <a href="02577a.htm">biretta</a>, or four-cornered cap, may be worn on academic occasions, but not in choir (Cong. of Rites, "In Venusina", 1844, and reply to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santiago de Chile, 6 Sept., 1895); the ring may be worn at all times except at Mass and other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions (Cong. of Rites, 12 Feb., 1892).</li><li>The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXII, c. ii, "de Ref.") decreed that a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be either doctor or licentiate in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> or in canon law; if a religious, he should have proper testimonials from his superiors. It enacted the same requirement for the <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. xii, "de Ref."). Regarding the <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> and, the <em>p&oelig;nitentiarius</em>, it prescribed that they should either have the degree or be otherwise well qualified. The Congregation of Studies recently decided (7 March, 1908) that the penitentiary and <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, if not already doctors, must receive the degree within a year. The Const. "Sapienti consilia" (29 June, 1908) prescribes the doctorate in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and Canon law for the officials of the <a href="13205c.htm">Rota</a> and Signatura. It has been a matter of controversy whether the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to be a doctor and whether the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> concerning the <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> is still in force. For the divergent opinions, see Card. Gennari, "Questioni Canoniche" (Rome, 1908), pp. 372, 292. The whole tenor of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation has been in favour of requirements which secure scientific qualifications in those who are appointed to official positions in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. </li></ol></div>
