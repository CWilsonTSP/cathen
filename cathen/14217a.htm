<p>(d'Espinosa, Despinoza).</p>

<p>Born at <a href="01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, 24 Nov., 1632; died at <a href="07108a.htm">The Hague</a>, 21 Feb., 1677. He belonged to a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Jewish merchants of moderate means, and was originally called Baruch, a name that he later translated into its Latin equivalent Benedict. His father's name was Michael, his mother, Michael's second wife, was called Hana Debora. In 1641 Michael married a third wife who was named Hester de Espinosa. The <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> probably had some connexion with the little town of Espino in Spanish Galicia, and with the celebrated Marrano <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> there called Espinosa. (The Marranos were <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> compelled to conform outwardly to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.) Baruch attracted attention in the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for Portuguese <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> at <a href="01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a> by his talents and application to study. He made rapid progress in Hebrew and the study of the Talmud, and his teachers, especially Rabbi Saul Levi Morteira, had the greatest hopes of his future. It was intended that he should become a rabbi. The subtle methods of the teachers of the Talmud undoubtedly trained his <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> and led it particularly to reasoning by analogy. The moral teaching of the Haggada had a great and permanent influence upon his code of living. However, the difficulties in regard to the Scriptures, which he <a href="04674a.htm">deduced</a> from what he read, made a stronger impression upon him than their solutions. Thus he was a troublesome and critical pupil, although at the same time a modest one. He read and despised the Cabalists; yet traces of their influence are recognizable in his philosophy; mention should here be particularly made of the book called "Zohar" and of Herrera's work "Porta c&aelig;li". He studied industriously the Jewish writers on the philosophy of religion, especially <a href="09540b.htm">Maimonides</a>, Gersonides, Chasdai Kreskas, and Ibn Esra, and later adopted much from them. The writings of the Arabian <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Al Farabi and of his commentator Ismail show striking similarities, even in the smallest details, with the later system of Spinoza. There are also clear evidences of connexion between the strange work of Ibn Tofail, the story of "Hai Ibn Joktan", and the conceptions of Spinoza.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>About 1651 Spinoza, unable to see his way clearly, seems for a short time to have abandoned metaphysical studies, and to have fought a hard battle with his passions. Even at this time he was looked upon with suspicion by <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. He now devoted himself to the natural philosophy of <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a>. Coming back in his way to <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, he completely overcame the scepticism, and, resuming his first studies, began to lay the foundation of his new system. The philosophy of <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a> aided him in recasting the notions which he had previously acquired. After the death of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> in 1654, Spinoza was almost completely cast off by his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and, having no means, taught in the private Humanistic <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the ex-Jesuit and <a href="06258b.htm">freethinker</a> Franz van den Enden. Here he perfected himself in Latin and continued his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> investigations by the study of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> (in a somewhat superficial manner), the philosophy of the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> and that of some modern writers, especially of Hobbes. His later <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> shows extraordinary similarities with the teachings of Marcus Marci and of Glisson.</p>

<p>Spinoza now frequented almost exclusively the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, i.e. of the <a href="06258b.htm">free-thinking</a> sort, and especially of <a href="10190b.htm">Mennonites</a>. His lifelong friendships, as known from his letters, date in part from this period. In 1656 he was formally expelled from the Jewish community and soon afterwards from <a href="01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>. A somewhat legendary attack upon his life is said to have been made about this time. He never became a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. He now began to dictate in Latin some of the principles of his philosophy to a company of pupils at Ouderkerk near Amsterdam. A <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> translation of this dictation exists in two <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which were discovered in 1853 and 1861 by Friedrich M&uuml;ller, a <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> bookseller. The translation as found in these <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> had been largely revised, had notes that were traceable, however, to Spinoza himself, and had been somewhat unskillfully handled by an editor. Since the discovery the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> have been published a number of times both in the original text and in translations. The characteristics of the later system of the "Ethics" are evident in this "Korte Verhandeling van God, de Mensch, en deszelvs Welstand". But neither the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the one and only Divine substance, nor the higher unity of "extension" and "thought" in the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> and the finite, nor the <a href="08050b.htm">instinct</a> of self-preservation, is clearly expressed in it. Spinoza, <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to seek some other means of support, became a very skilful grinder of lenses; his work commanded good prices. About 1660 he retired to the village of Rijnsburg near Leyden. The little house in which he lived still stands, and has been bought by admirers of the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; it contains a fine <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>. Here Spinoza devoted himself to a revision of the "Korte Verhandeling" which was never completed. The result of these labours was an important unfinished treatise "De intellectus emendatione", with preparations for his great work, the "Ethics", and the development of the "geometrical method". While at Rijnsburg he was greatly stimulated in his work by the reports of the lectures of the professors of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of Leyden (among whom should be included Geulincx), which were brought to him by students of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. While at this village he also became acquainted with the celebrated Stensen, and had here a pupil named Casearius, whom he instructed in the <a href="04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> philosophy. In 1663 Spinoza published a book under his own name called "Renati des Cartes principiorum philosophi&aelig; Pars I et II, more geometrico demonstrat&aelig;", and a supplement to this under the title, "Cogitata metaphysica". The work does not give Spinoza's own philosophy, but glimpses of his views may be found in it.</p>

<p>While at Rijnsburg Spinoza also taught by correspondence some young friends at <a href="01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a> who had moved to Voorburg, near The Hague. His acquaintance with scholars and statesmen increased. He was witty, was esteemed as a great Biblical critic and mathematician, and had the reputation of possessing a fine political sense. Jan de Witt and van Beuningen held him in high regard. Huygens interested himself in Spinoza's lenses. Great expectations were expressed of his philosophy by Heinrich Oldenburg of <a href="02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, who had visited Spinoza at Rijnsburg, and now, in connexion with Robert Boyle, was active in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> as the secretary of the Royal Society, and by the learned Ludwig Meyer. While living at Voorburg Spinoza worked hard on a lengthy treatise to which he later gave the title of "Tractatus theologico-politicus". He drew largely for this work from the Arabian and Jewish philosophy of religion and from the old rabbinical <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. But his main sources were early, little-known Jewish <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> and obscure <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers of his own time, especially Peyr&#232;re's "Systema theologicum ex Pr&aelig;adamitarum hypothesi" (1655). Spinoza's political views were largely inspired by Jan de Witt and his friends; the same opinions are to be found in the writings of other <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> political writers of the same period, e.g. <a href="07502a.htm">van den Hove</a>. Spinoza, however, in publishing his treatise, had special aims in view. It was intended to establish and enlarge the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political principles of Jan de Witt and at the same time to lead the way to the publication of his own philosophy. According to Spinoza the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are not without <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> and are not inspired in the strict sense. They do not teach us with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> as to the <a href="06612a.htm">nature of God</a> and His characteristics, but only concerning obedience to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. Consequently the text of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> can never come into conflict with philosophy and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>. But, according to Spinoza, the limitations of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and law are also clearly defined. As it is only in the State that <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and law, <a href="08010c.htm">injustice</a> and transgression are conceivable, the individual, in order to be able to live according to reason, must surrender his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> to the community. Then, too, he must obey the government in everything, even against his reason and conviction, unless a command contradicts universal feeling, as the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> of <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>. Freedom of thinking and speaking, however, cannot be forbidden by the State; if it has the power to do this, the right, indeed, cannot be denied it, but the prohibition would be disadvantageous to it, because its own existence would be endangered by such tyranny. No man can ever act according to his convictions, if a law of the State stands in the way. Thus Spinoza upholds only a partial freedom of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>. On the other hand the government has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to supervise the external practice of religion. It is easy to understand that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> councils and <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> took energetic measures against this work, which appeared anonymously in 1670. Up to 1676 at least thirty-seven decisions or edicts against the work had appeared.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From 1670 Spinoza lived at <a href="07108a.htm">The Hague</a>, at first in the Veerkade, then not far from this spot in the Paviljoensgracht, near the monument erected in 1880. Both houses are still in existence, but the latter, in which Spinoza died, has lately been completely rebuilt. The <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> laboured with <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> on his great work; in order to be independent and undisturbed in elaborating his system of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> he declined a call to a professorship at <a href="07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a>. His plan to publish his system of ethics in 1675 failed, owing to the opposition of his enemies. Originally Spinoza seems to have had the intention to found a kind of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> world-religion. He believed that the basic <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of his view of the world were to be found among the old Hebrews, in Christ, and in <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. In his opinion this philosophy, without the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, sufficed for the truly wise. In order to understand his conception of the original <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> it must be remembered that his acquaintance from the beginning had been among latitudinarian <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who emphasized the moral life, not <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, that, with many of his <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> friends, he regarded the Antitrinitarians as the most genuine <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that he found traces of his philosophy in the writings of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> mystics, and finally that among the first writings which had introduced him to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had been Hobbes's books "De cive" and "Leviathan". Towards the end of his life Spinoza had bitter disappointments, which, however, seldom disturbed his stoical composure. He lived tranquilly at <a href="07108a.htm">The Hague</a> in the midst of his work, his correspondence, and his friends. He began an exceedingly interesting political treatise in which he did not change his earlier views but rather carried them further. He also wrote a short treatise on the rainbow, and a Hebrew grammar, and, as it seems, translated the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. He was a victim to the disease from which his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> suffered, consumption, and this was aggravated by his work in grinding lenses. He died peacefully, in the presence of a physician who was a friend. Even the other people in the house did not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> he was dying. The little he left was, as it were, a mirror of his life. Spinoza was a very frugal and unselfish man. He declined all money and pensions that he did not absolutely require. His way of living could not be simpler; it was only for books that he spent relatively large sums. The virtues which he most highly prized and consistently practised were control of the feelings, equability of spirit, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of country, loyalty and industry, moderation and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. In <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> he was animated and witty; he enjoyed being alone, and yet was kindly disposed towards his fellow men. Union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, as he conceived of the Deity, i.e. as a thinking and <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>, necessarily existing, immanent cause of all existence, and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for this Being were to him the highest of all things. He was immovably convinced that his was the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> philosophy, could scarcely understand any view that deviated from his own, was hard and <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> in the judgments of other thinkers, was not easily approached with objections, and was incapable of appreciating with historical objectivity other views of the world.</p>

<p>In 1677 his literary remains were published under the title "B. D. S. Opera posthuma". In this publication were included his system of ethics, the unfinished political tractate, the treatise "De emendatione intellectus", letters to and from him, and lastly his compendium of Hebrew grammar. The <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> translation of the same year has great critical value. The tractate on the rainbow was first published anonymously in <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> at <a href="07108a.htm">The Hague</a> in 1687. The problems added for the calculus of probabilities are not by Spinoza. The <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> seems to have destroyed his translation of the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>; the Spanish apology which he drew up when expelled form the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a> has not, so far, been found.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe in a short article the Spinozistic system as a whole. For it is just the rigidly unified, minute construction of that system and the labyrinth of its thought processes that are of importance for the history of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> as an original creation. On the other hand, the elements, bases, and individual results are neither new nor original. Spinoza's view of the world is so constructed that the final results can be reached with equal <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a> from its <a href="05506a.htm">epistemological</a> and <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> assumptions, and from its <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> and metaphysical axioms. The view of Spinozism held by the present writer, which frequently varies from the views formerly held, can merely be indicated in what follows.</p>

<p>According to Spinoza there are no universal notions. Only that is thinkable which actually exists or will exist at some time. Further, only the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> is thinkable. Existence and necessity, however, cannot be <a href="04674a.htm">deduced</a> from the nature of finite things; we must therefore conceive of a Being (<a href="06608a.htm">God</a>) necessarily existing and necessarily acting, from which all else follows of necessity. This Being is not the cause but the first principle in the manner of mathematical entities; the things come from it by mathematical sequence, for only in this way, says the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, can the immutability of the first principle be maintained, only thus is a relation of the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> to the finite thinkable; and only in this way is the unity of nature preserved, without fusing the substance of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> with that of finite things. Yet the axiom "God=Nature" is valid because the things necessarily following from the Being of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> belong in some way to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Only the Being of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is independent; Spinoza calls this Being alone substance. All things (<em>modi</em>) must be founded in the <a href="06612a.htm">attributes of God</a>. This is one approach to Spinozism.</p>

<p>Another is the following: Spinoza observed in nature, on the one side, only systems of motion and rest which were derived from one another in an endless series of causes and effects; on the other side, running exactly parallel to these, but not influenced by them, a series of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. These systems of motion and <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> cannot be understood of themselves alone, but only with the aid of the notions of extension and thought, and these two notions contain in themselves the characteristic of <a href="08004a.htm">infinity</a>. Thus we are brought to a necessarily existing Being on whom all other beings must depend in their existence and nature. The facts of experience, as <em>conditio sine qua non,</em> lead us to the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that the change which we observe can only be explained by an <a href="08050b.htm">instinct</a> of self-preservation existing in all things, which constitutes their individual nature. This <a href="08050b.htm">instinct</a>, then, is the relative factor in the scientific construction of ethics and politics. The <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a>, which corresponds to it and establishes it, consists of the immanently working, countless attributes of the universal substance. This is the second approach to Spinozism.</p>

<p>We now come to a third: Scepticism is completely overcome only when the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is nothing else than the objective side of the process of movement which is identical with it under another point of view. Only then does the succession of things fully coincide with the succession of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Thus <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> are the same. The fact that there are ill-defined and <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> can, accordingly, only be explained in that these <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, so far as they do not prove themselves to be arbitrary combinations and fictions, are merely part-knowledge. Such part-knowledge, however, signifies that the one with such <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is in some sense part of an absolute intelligence. Therefore the part-extension identical with and corresponding with the part-knowledge is only a part of an <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> and indivisible extension. Consequently, in the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> also, extension and thought are, absolutely considered, identical; as relative things they are different. Applied to ethics this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> signifies that <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> have meaning only from the point of view of an incomplete part-knowledge; aplied to politics it sets up for the individual life the axiom right is might, and ascribes to the State the creation of right.</p>

<p>Lastly, ethics as a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which is really Spinoza's starting-point, leads to the same result. His main question was, how is perfect <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> possible? Now he could only conceive of perfect peace and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> on the supposition that all earthly happenings proceed as the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequence of the nature of the absolutely <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> Being; whomever recognizes this and rests lovingly in this <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> enjoys perfect peace. The aim of life is to attain this <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <em>cognitio subspecie &aelig;ternitatis</em>. From this opinion, however, it follows necessarily that the individual acts of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> proceed in some manner from <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> own thought (the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> therefore is no substance), that the nature of the individual <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is an individual <a href="08050b.htm">instinct</a> towards perfection (<em>conatus in suo esse perseverandi</em>&mdash;in order to preserve the continuity of all self-consciousness), that <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> proceeds from a lack of adequate <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that the material is only another side of the spiritual, because otherwise Spinoza would have had to suppose a second source of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> besides imperfect <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>These statements show also the way in which Spinoza can be refuted. It must be shown that <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> unchangeableness does not involve the necessity of all Divine action; it must be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that the dependence of the finite upon the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> does not demand a counter-relation in the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and that there is a <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysic</a> world of pure possibility and universal conceptions. Further, it must be shown that an objectively <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is possible, even though the order of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> does not run strictly parallel to the order of things, and though the two orders are not identical. The positive contradictions of this identity in the finite must be revealed, and it must be shown that in the Spinozistic <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> the continuity of self-consciousness, notwithstanding the <a href="08050b.htm">instinct</a> of self-preservation, is destroyed, and that the part-knowledge of Spinoza, with the system of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> built upon it, involves an impenetrable mystery and therefore is untenable as a <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> view of the world. Some friends and later admirers of Spinoza thought they could combine his philosophy with <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. A hopeless attempt in this direction is made in the introduction to the "Opera posthuma" written by Ludwig Meyer. Jarrig Jellis, Spinoza's friend, also exerted himself to bring Spinozism and <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> together. More ingenious and profound but also exceedingly sophisticated is the treatise issued anonymously in 1684 by Abraham Cuffeler, "Specimen artis ratiocinandi naturalis et artificialis ad pantosophi&aelig; principia manuducens". A number of writers leave one in <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to whether they did not use <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> merely as a cloak. Others, e.g. Bredenburg, and Wittich in his "Anti-Spinoza", adopted only individual principles of Spinozism. When in the second half of the eighteenth century the reputation of Spinoza was again revived both in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> simultaneously, the effort was once more made to reconcile Spinozism and <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Mention might here be made of Heydenreich, <a href="07251c.htm">Herder</a>, and Sabatier de Castres.</p>

<p>That in the present time Spinoza has again become very modern is traceable to nine reasons: his criticism of the Scriptures, his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="06258b.htm">free-thought</a>, his theory of the State as the source of right, his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> founded on necessity, his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> dissociated from positive religion, his axiom <em>Deus sive Natura</em> and the justification of this axiom, his conception of the identity of thought and movement in the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a>, his distinction of absolute and relative <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, finally his realism in the theory of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to which many modern <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are returning.</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bibliography prepared by VAN DER LINDE extends only to 1871. It has been partially supplemented by GRUNWALD, <em>Spinoza in Deutschland</em> (Berlin, 1897), by WEG, <em>Katalog 29</em> (Leipzig, 1893), which contained the collection of works on Spinoza that had been sold for America, and by the Katalog "Spinoza", No. 598 (Frankfort, 1912). The relatively best but in no way complete edition of his works is that of VAN VLOTEN AND LAND (2nd ed., The Hague, 1895). Of this publication the "Ethics" alone has appeared in a third edition (1905). English translations of Spinoza, omitting the defective one of WILLIS, are: FULLERTON, <em>Ethics</em> (New York, 1894); HALE WHITE and HUTCHINSON STERLING (3rd ed., London, 1899); this edition includes also the <em>De intellectus emendatione</em>; ELWES has edited the chief works (London, 1883-84), but with the letters freely abridged; GILLINGHAM ROBINSON, <em>Korte Verhandeling</em> (Chicago, 1909), defective, see below Wolf. An excellent translation into Dutch of all the works of Spinoza is that of MEYER (Amsterdam, 1897-1905); the best French translation is that of APPUHN (Paris, 1907-09), the correspondence and the theologico-political and the political treatises have yet to be published. Among the German translations should be mentioned the one made for the Philosophical Library by B&#196;NSCH, BUCHENAU, and GEBHARDT. An excellent facsimile edition of all the letters was issued by MEIJER in numbered copies at The Hague. A facsimile of the notes in handwriting to the theologico-polital treatise was published by ALTKIRCH in the journal <em>Ost und West</em> (1901).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;FREUDENTHAL, <em>Die Lebensgeschichte Spinoza in Quellenschriften, Urkunden und nichtamtlichen Nachrichten</em> (Leipzig, 1899), and <em>Spinoza I, Das Leben Spinoza</em> (Stuttgart, 1904). A quantity of new material is in MEINSMA, <em>Spinoza en zijn Kring</em> (The Hague, 1896). The youth and development of Spinoza is described in detail by DUNIN-BORKOWSKI, <em>Der junge De Spinoza, Leben u. Werdegang im Licht der Weltphilosophie</em> (M&#252;nster, 1910).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other biographies which also contain exposition of the ethical system are: POLLOCK, <em>Spinoza, His Life and Philosophy</em> (2nd ed., London, 1899); WILLIS, <em>B. de Spinoza, His Life, Correspondence and Ethics</em> (2nd ed., London, 1870); KUNO FISCHER, <em>Spinozas Leben, Werke und Lehre</em> (5th ed., Heidelberg, 1900); COUCHOUD, <em>Beno&#238;t de Spinoza</em> (Paris, 1902); BRUNSCHVICG, <em>Spinoza</em> (2nd ed., Paris, 1906). WOLF has lately issued an English translation of the <em>Korte Verhandeling,</em> with a life of Spinoza (London, 1910).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are innumerable presentations of Spinoza's theories; among those of earlier times the works of BOULAINVILLIERS, JACOB, the two SIGWARTS, TRENDELENBURG, and BOEHMER are very readable. Later works are: MARTINEAU, <em>A Study of Spinoza</em> (2nd ed., London, 1899); CAIRD, <em>Spinoza</em> (cheap ed., London, 1903); JOACHIM, <em>A Study of the Ethics of Spinoza</em> (Oxford, 1901); DIFF, <em>Spinoza's Political and Ethical Philosophy</em> (Glasgow, 1903); PICTON, <em>Spinoza, a Handbook to the Ethics</em> (London, 1907); CAMERER, <em>Die Lehre Spinozas</em> (1877); <em>Spinoza und Schliermacher</em> (Stuttgart, 1903); WENDELBAND in his history of modern philosophy. Very important for Spinoza's teaching is BRUNNER, <em>Die Lehre von den Geistigen und vom Volke,</em> I, pt. II (Berlin, 1908).<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of other important monographs there can only be mentioned: FULLERTON, <em>On Spinozistic Immortality</em> (Philadelphia, 1899); DELBOS, <em>Le probl&#232;me moral dans la philosophie de Spinoza</em> (Paris, 1893); WORMS, <em>La morale de Spinoza</em> (Paris, 1891); RIVAUD, <em>Les notions d'essence et d'existence dans la philos. de Spinoza</em> (Paris, 1906); L&#201;ON, <em>Les &#233;l&#233;ments Cart&#233;siens de la doctrine Spinoziste</em> (Paris, 1907); FREUDENTHAL, <em>Spinoza und die Scholastik</em> (Leipzig, 1887), 83, 138, one of the philosophical essays dedicated to W.
