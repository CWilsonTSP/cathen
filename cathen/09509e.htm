<p>On the second day of March, 1500, a fleet of thirteen ships, commanded by <a href="03128a.htm">Pedro Alvarez Cabral</a>, sailed from <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> to explore the Indian Ocean. On 10 August, one vessel of this fleet, commanded by Diego Dias, having been parted from the rest by stress of weather, came in sight of a point of land on the east coast of a large island. To this island the name of St. Lawrence was given, the day of its discovery being the <a href="06021b.htm">feast day</a> of that <a href="09089a.htm">martyr</a>; it is now the island of Madagascar, situated to the south-east of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, between 11 degrees 57 minutes 30 seconds and 25 degrees 38 minutes 55 seconds S. latittude, and between 43 degrees 10 minutes and 50 degrees 25 minutes East longitude. Many small islands of less importance are adjacent to it in the Indian Ocean and the Mozambique Channel, the principal being St. Mary, Mayotte, and Nossi-Be.</p>

<p>The island of Madagascar is, on the whole, very thinly populated, the population averaging little more than thirteen to the square mile; but this population is unevenly distributed, dense in the central regions and sparse in other parts. The principal ethnological divisions are the Hova, the Betsileo, the Sakalava, the Betsimisaraka, the Sihamaka, thee Antaimoro, the Antanosy. Since the French conquest of the island these various peoples, or tribes, have been distributed in provinces, circuits, and districts, all under the administration of a governor-general who resides at the capital, Tananarivo. Divers opinions have been put forward by the learned as to the origin of the peoples of Madagascar. M. Alfred Grandidier, who is an acknowledged authority in such matters, thinks, and the greater number of anthropologists think with him, that this population is of the black Indonesian race, and is therefore one of the chief groups of the Malayo-Polynesian countries. Malagasy (the chief language) seems to be related to the Malayo-Polynesian languages, is, like them, agglutinative, and has a grammar apparently based on general principles analogous to theirs. It is very rich on the material and physical side, and poor in the expression of abstract <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The religion of the Malagasies appears to be fundamentally a kind of mixed <a href="10499a.htm">Monotheism</a>, under the form of a <a href="06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> which finds expression in numerous <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices of which these people are very tenacious. Even those who have received <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> instruction and <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> retain a tendency to be guided, in the various circumstances of their lives, rather by these <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a> prescriptions than by the dictates of reason and <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. They admit the existence of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, but without, apparently, forming any very exact notion of it; in their conception, it is not so much a spirit made in the image of the Creator as a double of the man, only more subtile than the visible corporeal man. The Malagasy is naturally prone to lying, cupidity, and sexual immorality, which is for him so far from being a detestable vice that <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> are the first to introduce their children to debauchery. This immorality and the lack of stability and fidelity in marriage are the great obstacles to the development of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> in Madagascar.</p>

<p>The first <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to bring the Gospel of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to Madagascar after the discovery of the island, came with the Portuguese. Old documents mention religious who, about the year 1540, accompanied a colony of emigrants to the south-eastern part of the island, where they were all massacred together during the celebration of a feast. Then again, about 1585, Frey Jo&atilde;o de S. Thome, a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, appears to have been poisoned on the coast of the island. In the seventeenth century two <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> came from <a href="06602a.htm">Goa</a> with Ramaka, the young son of the King of Anosy. This youth had been taken away, in 1615, by a Portuguese ship, to <a href="06602a.htm">Goa</a>, where the viceroy had entrusted him to the care of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; he had been instructed and <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Ramaka's father permitted these two <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to preach <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in his dominions. But soon, when they were beginning to wield some power for good, the king, instigated by his <em>ombiasy</em> (sorcerers) forbade his subjects to either give or sell anything whatsoever to the fathers. One of the two died, but the other succeeded in returning to <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>. Some years after this, the <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, sent by <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, essayed to conquer Madagascar for the Faith. The Societe de l'Orient had then recently taken possession, in the name of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, of a tract of territory on the south-eastern littoral, and had named its principal establishment Fort-Dauphin. The first superior of this <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> mission was M. Nacquart; he left <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> with the Sieur de Flacourt, who represented the Societe de l'Orient, and one of his associates, M. Gondree. Arriving at Fort-Dauphin in December, 1648, M. Nacquart devoted himself most <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a>, amid difficulties of every kind, to the evangelization of the natives, until he was carried off by a fever, 29 May, 1650. M. Gondree had died the year before. During these fourteen months of apostolate seventy-seven <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> had received <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. It was not until four years later that MM. Mounier and Bourdaise came to continue the missionary work which had been initiated at such cost; but they too, succumbed to the severity of their task. A reinforcement of three missionaries sent to their assistance never reached them; one died at sea, the other two on the island of St. Mary, where they had landed. Nevertheless, <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> was not discouraged.</p>

<p>In 1663 M. Almeras, the successor of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> in the government of the Congregation of St. Lazare, obtained the appointment of M. Etienne as <a href="12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a> and sent him to Fort-Dauphin with two of his brethren and some workmen. On <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a> M. Etienne <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> fifteen little children and four adults. But it was not long before he, too, fell a victim to his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. On 7 March, 1665, four new missionaries set out, and on 7 January, 1667, they were followed by five <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and four <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, with two Recollet fathers. But in 1671, the Compagnie des Indes, which had succeeded to the Societe de l'Orient, having resolved to quit Madagascar, M. Jolly, M. Almeras' successor, recalled his missionaries. Only two out of thirty-seven who had been sent to the island, were able to return to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, in June 1676; all the rest had died in harness. From the forced abandonment of the Madagascar mission in 1674 until the middle of the nineteenth century, there were only a few isolated attempts, at long intervals, to resume the evangelization of the great African Island: we may mention those of M. Noinville de Glefier, of the Missions Etrangeres of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and of the <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> Monet and Durocher. The last-named even sent some natives to the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the view of training them for the apostolate in their own country.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1832 MM. de Solages and Dalmond laid the first foundations of the new Madagascar Mission. But by this time some <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="10237b.htm">Methodists</a>, supported by the Government of their country, had already succeeded in establishing themselves in the centre of the island. The Rev. Mr. Jones had obtained authorization from the Court of Imerina to open a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Tananarivo, the capital. Other <a href="01498a.htm">English Protestant</a> missionaries followed him, and by 1830 they had thirty-two <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in Imerina, with four thousand pupils. When, moreover, it was learned at Tananarivo that the new <a href="12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, M. de Solages, a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, was on his way to the capital, everything was done to arrest his progress, and he died of misery and grief at Andovoranto. M. Dalmond took up the work begun by M. de Solages. After preaching the Gospel in the small island off the coast until about 1843, he returned to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in order to recruit a large missionary force. The aid which he so much needed he obtained from Father Roothan, the general of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who authorized him to take six fathers or brothers from the Lyons province. Two <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from the Holy Ghost Seminary went with them. After a fruitless attempt at Saint-Augustin, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a> set themselves to evangelize the adjacent islands of St. Mary, Nosi-Be, and Mayote. Assisted by the <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny, they also made earnest efforts towards the instruction and <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the Malagasy boys and girls in the island of Reunion (or Bourbon). They did not, however, by any means lose sight of the great island, and again endeavoured to establish themselves on its littoral, but were once more compelled to abandon their <a href="06147a.htm">brave</a> enterprise.</p>

<p>It was only in 1855 that Pere Finaz, disguised, and under an assumed name, was able to penetrate as far as the capital. "At last", he exclaimed in the <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> of his heart, "I am at Tananarivo, of which I take possession in the name of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>." Waiting for the time when he should be able to freely announce the Gospel to the Hova, he used all his efforts to prolong his stay at the capital without arousing suspicion, making himself useful and agreeable to the queen and the great personages of the realm. He sent up a balloon before the awe-stricken populace assembled in the holy place of Mahamasina; he contrived theatrical performances on a stage constructed and set by himself; he made them a telegraphic apparatus, a miniature railroad, and other things wonderful in their eyes. Meanwhile, Fathers Jouen and Weber, under assumed names, joined Father Finaz at Tananarivo, coming as assistants to a surgeon, Dr. Milhet-Fontarabie, who had been summoned from Reunion by the Queen of Madagascar, Ranavalona I, to perform a rhinoplastic operation on one of her favourites. But this state of affairs was not to last long; Ranavalona soon grew suspicious and ordered the expulsion of the few <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a> who resided at Tananarivo. The fathers, however, had managed, during their brief stay at the capital, to conciliate the favour of the heir presumptive, Ranavalona's son. And so it was that, in 1861, when this same prince, on the death of his mother, succeeded to the throne as Radama II, Fathers Jouen and Weber could return to Tananarivo, bringing with them a small contingent of <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a> and <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny, and without being <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a>, this time, to dissemble their object in coming.</p>

<p>Radama II gave full authorization for the teaching of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in his dominions; and this much having been conceded to the French <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries, similar concessions had to be made to the <a href="01498a.htm">English Protestants</a> of the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> Missionary Society. What with the large subventions furnished by this organization to its emissaries, and the clever manoeuvres of some of them-particularly of Mr. Ellis-after the tragic death of Radama II, the English missionaries acquired considerable influence with the new queen, Rasoherina, and her chief adviser, Rainilaiarivony, to the detriment of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries. The latter, moreover, were few in number-six fathers and five <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> at Tananarivo, with two small <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and one, under the <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny, for girls; and at Tamatave, three fathers, one <a href="09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, and two sisters. Nevertheless, in spite of all difficulties, the number of <a href="10742a.htm">neophytes</a> increased and, especially after the arrival of the <a href="08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> in 1866, the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> took on fresh vigour. Already four <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were in operation within the capital city, and the missionaries thought of extending their efforts outside. Father Finaz opened the missionary station at Antanetibe on 12 September, 1868; by the end of 1869, thirty-eight groups of <a href="10742a.htm">neophytes</a> had been formed, twenty-two <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> built, and twenty-five <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> opened. Betsileo was occupied in 1871, then Ampositra and Vakinankaratra. A propaganda periodical, "Resaka", was founded. A leper-house was built to receive about one hundred patients. The sisters gave care and remedies to the large numbers who daily applied at their dispensary. A fine large <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of cut stone was erected in the centre of Tananarivo. When the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the Hova broke out in 1883, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission numbered 44 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 19 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 8 <a href="08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, 20 <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny (besides 3 native <a href="12319b.htm">postulants</a> and 3 <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>), 346 native male, and 181 native <a href="15687b.htm">female</a>, teachers, 20,000 pupils, a <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> amounting to 80,000, 152 churches and 120 <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> completed, and 11 churches and 43 <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> in course of construction. In the year ending July, 1882, there were 1161 <a href="02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of adults, 1882 infant <a href="02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, 55,406 confessions, 580 first communions, 45,466 ordinary communions, 860 confirmations, and 190 marriages. Sir Gore Jones, a British Admiral, whose testimony cannot be suspected of favourable bias, declared in 1883, in a report to his Government after a visit to the island made by its orders, that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries, "working silently in Madagascar", were planting in that land "a tree far superior to all others".</p>

<p>On 17 May, 1883, Admiral Pierre took possession of Majunga in the name of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and on 11 June of Tamatave. A formal order of the queen expelled all the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries and all French citizens. "Do not resist the queen's word", was the answer of the more responsible among the native <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> when the fathers consulted them as to the course to be pursued. "To do so would be to compromise our future and, perhaps, to bring upon us more serious misfortunes. If you submit now, you will the more easily return later on." They left the centre of the island-at the same time leaving the native <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to their own resources-and went down to the coast. For two years, more or les, while hostilities lasted, the Malagasy <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, left without <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, were able to maintain their religion-thanks to the devotion and energy of Victoire Rasoamanarivo, a lady related to the prime minister, of the native Brother Raphael of the Congregation of the Christian Schools, and of some members of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union. This organization, consisting of young Malagasies, shows a truly wonderful <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> in their efforts to make up for the absence of the fathers. Both in the city <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and at the country stations, they made themselves ubiquitous, instructing and encouraging the <a href="10742a.htm">neophytes</a>. At Tananarivo they sang the choral parts of high Mass every <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a>, just as if the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> had been at the altar; and the native Government, compelled to admire their fidelity, permitted this exercise of devotion. On the first <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after the departure of the fathers, when the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> attempting to enter the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> were warned away, Rasoamanarivo said to the guards at the door: "If you must have blood, begin by shedding mine; but fear shall not keep us from assembling for <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>."</p>
