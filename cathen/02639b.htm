<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF BOLOGNA</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Bologna is the principal city in the province of the same name, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and contains about 150,000 inhabitants. It was founded by the Etruscans, who called it Felsina. Later it fell into the hands of the Boii, a Gallic tribe, and from that time took the name of Bononia, whence the present form. The regions round about having been laid waste by the continual <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, in 189 B.C. the Romans established a colony thee, which was enlarged and beautified by <a href="02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. After Byzantium had broken the power of the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Bologna belonged to the Exarchate of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (536). By the donation of Pepin Bologna was made part of the <a href="14257a.htm">patrimony of the Holy See</a>, but during the disturbances of the ninth century was wrested from the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. At the beginning of the ninth century it was laid waste during the incursions of the Hungarians. <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a> did much to restore the city to its former condition giving it the privilege of enacting its own <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and making it directly dependent on the imperial authority. Bologna was then governed by consuls. During the struggles between the empire and the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, the city took the part of the latter and was enable to assert its independence, which was definitely recognized by Henry V in 1122. Bologna was among the first to join the Lombard League. From 1153 it was ruled by podestas, who were for most part foreigners. From the accession of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, Bologna was rent into the two factions of <a href="07056c.htm">Guelphs and Ghibellines</a>, the former being in the majority. On 26 May, 1249, the inhabitants of Bologna in the battle of Fossalto conquered the troops of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> under the leadership of King Enzo (Ezzelino); Enzo himself was taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and neither the threats nor the promises of Frederick availed to secure his liberty. He remained in captivity until his death, eleven years later, although for the rest he was always treated with the greatest consideration.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1276, in order more thoroughly to safeguard their communal liberty, the inhabitants of Bologna placed themselves under the protection of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and <a href="11056a.htm">Pope Nicholas III</a> sent them as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> his nephew, <a href="11325b.htm">Berotoldo Orsini</a>, whom he also commissioned to reconcile the opposing factions. In the fourteenth century the preponderance of power was in the hands of the Pepoli <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, but later passed to the Visconti of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who alternated with the <a href="02483a.htm">Bentivoglio family</a> in holding the reins of power. At intervals the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> attempted to make their authority recognized, or else the city spontaneously recognized their sovereignty (1327-34; 1340-47; 1360-76, through the efforts of Cardinal Albornoz; 1377-1401; 1403-11, during the pontificate of <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>; 1412-16; 1420-28, under Cardinal Condulmer). In the beginning of the fifteenth century there were frequent popular uprisings against the nobility. From 1443 to 1506 three of the <a href="02483a.htm">Bentivoglio family</a> succeeded each other as masters of Bologna. In 1506 <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a> incorporated Romagna into the <a href="14257a.htm">papal states</a>, Bologna included; the city, however, retained a great degree of communal autonomy. The <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority was vested in a legate te, who in the beginning was generally a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, later, however, only a <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1796 Bologna was occupied by the French and made a part of the Cisalpine Republic, and afterwards of the Italian Kingdom. In 1814 it was seized by the Austrians, who in 1815 restored it to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. From the time of its restoration, Bologna was the scene of a series of deep-seated agitations and revolts against the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> rule. These uprisings were repressed by Austrian troops. Finally, in 1859 Romagna, together with the Marches and Umbria, was annexed to the <a href="08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>.</p>

<h2>Christianity in Bologna</h2>

<p>The only sources for the history of the beginnings of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Bologna are legendary accounts, according to which St. Apollinaris, disciple of St. Peter and first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, was the first to preach the Gospel in Bologna. The first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is said to have been St. Zama, who is supposed to have been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Pope St. Dionysius (270). However, it may be maintained with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> that <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and likewise the episcopate, in Bologna dates back to a more remote period. During the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, Bologna was the scene of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of <a href="15486b.htm">Sts. Vitalis and Agricola</a>, whose bodies were <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> in a Jewish cemetery and only discovered in the time of <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, in 392, as related by him in a letter (Ep.lv), the authenticity of which, however, is questioned. The fact is referred to perhaps, by Paulinus in his life of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, when he speaks of Ambrose taking to Florence some <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of these <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. It was possibly the same <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> that the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="12449b.htm">St. Proculus</a> occurred. The episcopal See of Bologna was first subject to the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and later, probably after <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> had fallen into the hands of the Lombards, it recognized the authority of the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. In 1106 it was placed immediately under the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Finally, in 1582 <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> raised the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bologna to the dignity of a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, assigning him as suffragans the Sees of <a href="07692a.htm">Imola</a>, <a href="03545b.htm">Cervia</a>, <a href="10413a.htm">Modena</a>, <a href="12717a.htm">Reggio</a>, <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a>, <a href="12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> and Crema; today, however, only Imola and <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a> are suffragan to Bologna.</p>

<p>Among the Bishops of Bologna worthy of note are Sts. Faustinianus, Basil and Eusebius, in the fourth century. About 400 there is record of St. Felix, succeeded about 430 by <a href="11782a.htm">St. Petronius</a>, who is extolled for having restored the church of Bologna, and who later became patron of the city. His <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved in the church of San Stefano. A number of the Bishops of Bologna were later raised to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> chair, as, for instance, John X, Cosimo Migliorati, who assumed the name of <a href="08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>; Tomaso Parentuccelli, later <a href="11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>; Giuliano della Rovere, who became <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a>; Alessandro Ludovisi, or <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>; and Prospero Lambertini, or <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>. The last two mentioned were born in Bologna. Other celebrated <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Cardinal Filippo Caraffa (1378-89); Cardinal Antonio Correr (1407-12); Blessed Nicol&oacute;, <a href="01258b.htm">Cardinal Albergati</a> (1417-34); <a href="03223a.htm">Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio</a>, known for the many embassies on which he was sent to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, in connection with the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and the marriage of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> (1523-25). After Bologna became an <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, almost all the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> were <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, among whom may be mentioned: Gabriele Paleoti (1591-97), who left the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as it exists today, built the episcopal palace, and endeavoured to put the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reforms into execution in Bologna; Vincenzo Malvessi (1754-75), to whom the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> owed much; Carlo Opizzoni (1802-55); Michele Viale Prel&acirc; (1855-60); Lucido Maria Parocchi (1877-82). Bologna was also the birthplace of the following <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, in addition to the two already mentioned: Honorius II (Lamberto Scannabecchi), Lucius II (Gherardo Caccianemici dell' Orso), <a href="01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> (Pietro Filargo), <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> (Ugo Buoncompagni), and <a href="08020a.htm">Innocent IX</a> (Giannantonio Facchinetti).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Churches</h2>

<p>Chief among the sacred edifices of Bologna is the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to St. Peter and erected by the commune in 910 to replace the ancient <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which stood outside the city walls. Destroyed by fire in 1130, it was but rebuilt in 1165 in its present form it dates from 1605, according to plans drawn by the Magenta, a <a href="02302a.htm">Barnabite</a>. The fa&ccedil;ade however, was designed by Alf. Torreggiani, who also added the first two <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> to the church. The majority of the <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> are by famous masters, as, for instance, Ventura da Bologna, Ercole Graziani, Francesco Tadolini, Onofrio Zanotti, del Bagnacavallo (Bartolommeo Ramenghi), <a href="03374c.htm">Ludovico Caracci</a>, and others. There is also a <a href="04558a.htm">lower church</a> with five altars. Worthy of note is a crucifix of <a href="03473a.htm">cedar</a> wood <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the time of the old <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The church of San Petronio, dedicated to the patron of the city, was built by order of the Secento, at public expense, in 1390. A competition was announced for the plans, and among all the designs the preference was given those of Antonio Vincenzi, while the supervision of the work of erection was entrusted to Andrea Manfredi da Faenza. However, the original drawings, providing for an octagonal <a href="05100b.htm">dome</a> 500 feet high, were not adhered to. The fa&ccedil;ade still remains incomplete, only the lower part being covered with <a href="13641b.htm">sculptures</a> in marble. The ornamentation of the larger door is the work of Pietro della Fonte; many of the figures compare favourably with the works of an age in which the art was more highly developed. In the architrave is the Madonna and Child. The two <a href="10724a.htm">naves</a> are adorned with <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of Sts. Petronius and Ambrose. The carving of the doors was done by Sigismondo Bargelloso, aided by Andrea Magnani and Gabriele di Zeccaria. The two side doors are also adorned with magnificent carvings, the work of other artists. It is a three naved church, the twenty-three <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> being adorned with the masterpieces of distinguished artists of different ages. Worthy of note is the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> by <a href="13453c.htm">Sansovino</a>. A sun-dial is to be found there, likewise two clocks, among the first to be made in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> with pendulums. In Bologna is also the church of Corpus Domini, founded by St. Catherine de' Vigri, commonly known as <a href="03446a.htm">St. Catherine of Bologna</a>, and adjoining it the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>. In one of the <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> is preserved the mummified body of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, together with many objects used by her during life. There is also a beautiful <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Dominic, close by the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in which the death of St. Dominic occurred. The <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> is in itself a veritable museum of works of art by the great masters. The casket was carved by <a href="11047b.htm">Nicol&ograve; Pisano</a>, and one of the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> was done by <a href="03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> in his youth. The choir is beautifully inlaid with tinted wood, the work of Fra Damiano da Bergamo, a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="09093a.htm">lay brother</a>. The church is cruciform, and in one <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the cross is the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of King Ezzelino; in another that of <a href="12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>.</p>

<p>Among the many other churches, all rich in monuments, mention will be made only of San Stefano, made up of a group of <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> once used by ancient <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who dwelt there before the time of St. Benedict. The site later passed into the hands of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> who erected there a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> which in 1447 was reduced to the rank of an <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> to be held <em><a href="07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>. In 1493 the <a href="16020a.htm">Celestines</a> took possession, and remained there until 1797. A tablet found there proves that this was once the site of a <a href="14495a.htm">temple</a> of Isis. Among the different <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> should be mentioned Calvary, or of the Holy Sepulchre; it is octagonal in form, and contains replica in marble of the Holy Sepulchre in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; here was probably situated the <a href="02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the ancient <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was not far distant. The <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> of San Giacomo Maggiore, built in 1267; San Giovanni in Monte, said to have been erected by <a href="11782a.htm">St. Petronius</a> and renovated in 1221 and 1824; San Isaiah the most ancient; Santa Maria di Galliera; Santa Maria dei Servi; San Martino; San Paolo; and San Francesco, still incomplete &mdash; all rich in monuments of artistic and historic interest. Outside Bologna is situated the celebrated Certosa, built in 1334 and in 1802 converted into a community burying-ground. The church attached to the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> is dedicated to <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. On the Monte della Guardia is the shrine of the Madonna di San Luca, which is connected with the Saragossa Gate by a portico with 635 arches 11,483 feet (2.17 miles), in length, constructed between 1661 and 1739. The shrine takes its name from a <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a> of the Madonna attributed to <a href="09420a.htm">St. Luke</a>, which was brought here in 1160 by Euthymius, a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of Constantinople. The present church dates from 1731.</p>

<p>With respect to profane architecture, the first thing to be remarked are the porticoes in which nearly all the roads terminate. Noteworthy also are the towers, particularly that of the Asinelli, 320 feet in height, erected between 1105 and 1109, and nearby, that of the Garisendi, built in 1110, the inclination of which, it seems, was due to a subsidence of the earth, in the fourteenth century, which carried away the uppermost part of the tower; it is 154 feet in height, and has an inclination of 7.77 feet. First among the palaces is that of the Podest&acirc;, a structure dating back to 1801, where the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> for the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> was held in 1410; next in importance are the communal palace, the civic museum, and the Archiginnasio, or ancient <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>.</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of Bologna contains 389 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 1172 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and <a href="11271a.htm">oratories</a>, 837 <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 119 regular, 311 seminarians, 48 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 521 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 10 <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, 21 for girls, and a population of 565,489.</p>
