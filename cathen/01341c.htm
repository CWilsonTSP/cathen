<p>The German Imperial Territory so known, and divided for State purposes into three civil districts. Lower and Upper Alsace and Lorraine include the two <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Metz, which are <a href="05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.</p>

<p><a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> penetrated this region at an early period, partly owing to the presence of the Roman Legions, whose <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to guard the boundaries of the Empire against the attacks of the German hordes, partly through Roman merchants who traded with the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> on the right bank of the Rhine. The first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> of whose name we are historically certain is <a href="01380b.htm">St. Amandus</a> (commemorated 26 October), who was present at the Councils of <a href="13473a.htm">Sardica</a> (343) and of Cologne (346). The Lombard, <a href="11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a>, a contemporary of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, names <a href="04012c.htm">St. Clement I</a>, one of St. Peter's immediate successors at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>. Prior to the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the northern part of Alsace belonged to the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Speier, certain villages in the west to that of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, most of Upper Alsace to Basel, and the neighbourhood of Belfort to the Archdiocese of <a href="02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. The <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a> embraced the rest of Alsace, but extended to the right bank of the Rhine, including outside of Alsace the deaneries of Lahr or Ettenheim, Offenburg and Ottersweier. The <a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a> included districts now belonging to German and French Lorraine, to the Grand Duchies of Luxembourg and <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, to the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Palatinate, and to Lower Alsace. After the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> the provisions of the Concordat assigned the whole district between the Queich and Lake Biehler, with the Departments of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and the greater part of Mont Terrible (Pruntrut) to the <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a>, and those of Moselle, Forets, and Ardennes to the <a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>. During the nineteenth century great changes were brought about in the boundaries of both <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> by agreement arrived at between the civil and <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. The civil districts of Upper and Lower Alsace have belonged to the <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a> since 1874, and that of <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> to Metz.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Population</h2>

<p>The census of 1 December, 1900, distributes the population as follows:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><em><a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a></em>: 821,612 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 304,204 <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; 3,192 Dissidents; 25,414 <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>; 319 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of unknown religion; 1,154,741 total</li><li><em><a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a></em>: 488,838 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 67,874 <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; 1,224 Dissidents; 6,850 <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>; 43 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of unknown religion; 564,829 total </li></ul></div>

<p>These figures, however, do not include the 34,367 soldiers in the <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a>; and the 44,491 in the <a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, who are under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Army Bishop in <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>.</p>

<h2>Cathedral chapters</h2>

<p>There is a Cathedral chapter in each of these two <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, which consists in Strasburg of nine, and in Metz of eight actual irremovable canons (<em>canonici titulares</em>), whose appointment must be confirmed by the State. Several <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, moreover, nominated by the Bishops of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a> and Strasburg alone, belong to the chapters as <em>canonici honoris caus&acirc;</em>, as well as certain <em>canonici honorarii</em> living in the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, thirty-eight in Strasburg at the present time, and twenty-one in <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>. Four <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, also, not belonging to the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but who have been of service to it, have been made honorary canons by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>.</p>

<h2>Diocesan administration</h2>

<p>In the administration of the respective <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are assisted by three vicars-general in that of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and by two in that of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a> (who can only be appointed with the consent of the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>), and by seven secretaries in the former diocese and three in the latter.</p>

<h2>Parishes</h2>

<p>The <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Alsace-Lorraine, since the Concordat of 1901, have been divided into two classes: regular <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, whose incumbents must receive the approval of the Government, and are irremovable, and subordinate <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, whose incumbents are appointed by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> only, and may be removed by him. The regular <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, again, fall into two classes, according to their respective importance and revenues. In the <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a> there are thirty-eight <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the first, and thirty-four of the second class. In Metz there are sixteen of the first and thirty-nine of the second class. There are 617 subordinate <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a>, and 518 in the <a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>. In many <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are assisted by <a href="04570a.htm">curates</a>, who, almost without exception, live in the presbytery, the cost being paid to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> by the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>. The <a href="04570a.htm">curates</a> themselves are paid either by the State as are 221 in the <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a> and 118 in the <a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, or by towns and church-corporations (<em>Kirchenfabriken</em>), 73 in the former diocese, and 31 in the latter. Six holders of curacies in <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and three in Metz have houses of their own, and enjoy all the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, with the title of resident vicars. On 1 January, 1906, there were in the <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a>, besides the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, the <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11457b.htm">Paphos</a> (former Coadjutor of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>), the present Coadjutor (<a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05527a.htm">Erythrae</a>), 1,245 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, all but eleven of whom were born in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; in the <a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, besides the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 869 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 793 of whom were born in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and 76 elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Stipends</h2>

<p>The State pays the Bishops of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Metz $4,000 (16,000 marks) each; the Coadjutor of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> $2,000 (8,000 marks); the vicars-general $900 (3,600); and the canons $700 (2,800 marks). As the Coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, however, merely holds the office of <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> as subsidiary to his other functions, he receives only $500 (2,000 marks) in that capacity. The president of the Directory of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Augsburg Confession is paid $1,600 (6,400 marks) as stipend, and $400 (1,600 marks) for his expenses as representative; a <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> member $240 (960 marks); and each of the lay members $400 (1,600 marks). The Chief Rabbi in Strasburg receives $1,000 (4,000 marks) as salary, and $300 (1,200) for expenses as representative; each of the other chief rabbis $1,000 (4,000 marks). The state pays <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> on the following scale (see classification of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> given above):</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><em>To the age of 35</em>: $312 for sub-parishes</li><li><em>From 35 to 50</em>: $336 for sub-parishes</li><li><em>To the age of 50</em>: $500 for Class I <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; $425 for Class II <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a></li><li><em>From 50 to 60</em>: $525 for Class I <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; $450 for Class II <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; $362 for sub-parishes</li><li><em>From 60 to 70</em>: $550 for Class I <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; $475 for Class II <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; $400 for sub-parishes</li><li><em>Over 70</em>: $575 for Class I <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; $500 for Class II <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; $425 for sub-parishes </li></ul></div>

<p>Curates paid by the State receive $150 (600 marks). The State pays, besides, $4,650 (18,600 marks) for expenses of maintenance of the episcopal secretaries in <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Metz; $1,650 (6,600 marks) in each <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> for the music and choir of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; $500 (2,000 marks) for the expenses of confirmation and visitation journeys; $750 (3,000 marks) to the Coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> for living expenses; $19,750 (79,000 marks) as pensions for retirement and for maintenance of a retired coadjutor; $15,000 (60,000 marks) as extra assistance to <a href="04049b.htm">clergymen</a> and their relatives; $6,625 (26,500 marks) as pay for students in the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Metz; $4,500 (18,000 marks) as pay for students in the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> as well as assistance to home mission-schools; $31,250 (125,000 marks) in aid of church and presbytery-building, the furnishing and adorning of churches, and the like material outlay for the support of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. The Government pays $659,093 (2,636,370 marks) yearly as a regular contribution to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship, $218,742 (874,969 marks) to the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and $43,793 (175,170 marks) to the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p>The civil district of Lower Alsace pays the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> $1,000 (4,000 marks) and each <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and canon of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> $300 (1,200 marks) as additional salary.</p>

<h2>Church taxes</h2>

<p>At the session of the Provincial Diet in 1901 the proposal was made on behalf of the Government that the increasing needs of the various <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> recognized by the State should be met by means of the assessments, or church taxes, imposed by the State. Only the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church authorities, however, have so far acted on this recommendation, so that only the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> taxpayers are liable to these special taxes. They amounted (in 1906) to $47,218 (188,870 marks 48 pf.), and are applied to the increase of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> pastoral stipends and pensions, and the support of <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a>.</p>

<h2>Religious houses</h2>

<p>Prior to the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> there were about 100 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Alsace, in addition to the canons regular of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>, three houses of canonesses and nine collegiate churches.

<h2>Clerical seminaries</h2>

<p>The Episcopal Seminary, together with the Episcopal <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, consisting of faculties of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law, with power to confer academic degrees, were closed at the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. When, however, <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, by Article XI of the Concordat, granted each <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> permission to establish a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Bishop Laurine, who was made <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> in 1802, immediately proceeded to open a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city in the following year (1803), in which young <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> were <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> during the course of the nineteenth century. On the 5th of December, 1902, Cardinal Rampolla, Secretary of State, and the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> envoy to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, Freiherr von Rotenhahn, came to an agreement concerning the erection of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at the Kaiser-Wilhelm <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, which was accordingly opened in October, 1903, and in which the following subjects are taught: Preparatory instruction in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, dogmatics, <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, <a href="01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, <a href="07365a.htm">church history</a>, Old and <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, canon law, pastoral theology, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> archeology. The professors are chosen by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and confirmed in their appointment by the Emperor; they are <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make a profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> according to the forms and rules of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the presence of the Dean, before entering on their <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>. The rules which govern the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a> and at <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> apply to the Strasburg faculty and its members, in their relations with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. If the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> submit evidence that a professor is unfit to continue his functions as teacher either because of lack of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> or because of conduct unbecoming a <a href="04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, the State immediately provides a successor, and takes measures to terminate the offender's connection with the faculty. Alongside of this <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty the Episcopal Seminary continues to exist and gives the young students a <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> training and <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in all branches pertaining to the exercise of the <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> office. The <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, at the present time, is managed by a superior, a director, and three professors. The cost of maintenance for the faculty falls exclusively on the State; the seven ordinary and one extraordinary, professors who lecture before it, received in 1906, $11,875 (47,500 marks) among them, and $725 (2,900 marks) as extras. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a> are trained in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a> by professors of the Bishop's <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a>.</p>

<h2>Episcopal gymnasia</h2>

<p>Bishop Raess having refused to acknowledge the State supervision of the Preparatory Seminaries at <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (Lower Alsace) and Zillisheim (Upper Alsace), which, up to then, had been wholly subject to the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities, the two institutions were respectively closed, by Ober-President M&ouml;ller, on the 24th of June and the 17th of July, 1874. They have since been reopened (the one at Zillisheim on the 20th of April, 1880; the one at <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> on the 5th of April, 1883), and are now known as "episcopal gymnasia." Both institutions follow the curriculum of the higher government <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> under the supervision of the highest <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> council of Alsace-Lorraine. The teachers are appointed by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, subject to the approval of the council of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and must have passed an examination <em>pro facultate docendi</em> before the State commission. Both have the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to grant the certificates required to be admitted to the one-year military service as volunteers, to such of their students as have successfully completed their "lower second" class, that is to say, a six-years' high school course. In both <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> the final examinations of the students of the graduating class are conducted by the class-instructors under the supervision of the State <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> commission. They enjoy, there- fore the same <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> as the State gymnasia. The <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> are maintained by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> from fees amounting to $20 (80 marks) yearly from scholars in the preparatory classes (without Latin); and $30 (120 marks) for those of the gymnasium classes, as also from <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> received during <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, in virtue of extraordinary powers, grants an individual <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from abstinence during <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> and on all the fast days during the year, except <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, "on the express condition that all who avail themselves of it shall make a special offering on behalf of <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutions." These <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> amounted to $12,863 (51,453 marks) for the year 1902-3; and $13,455 (53,818 marks) for the year 1903-4. During the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> year 1904-5 thirty-nine teachers lectured at the Episcopal Gymnasium in <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and twenty-one at Zillisheim, to 565 and 271 scholars respectively. The Episcopal Gymnasium in the <a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, at Montigny, enjoys all the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of a State gymnasium, which are not possessed by the higher episcopal <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Bitsch or by the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Arnulf at <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>.</p>

<h2>Collections among the faithful</h2>

<p>Six church collections have been made <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>: on the Sunday after the Epiphany, for the African missions; on <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, for the <a href="05230a.htm">Christians of the East</a>; at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost, for the <a href="11774a.htm">Peter's Pence</a>; on the feast of the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church, for the abolition of alternate, or common, use of church edifices by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics; on the Sunday after the feast of <a href="11207b.htm">St. Odilia</a>, for the blind asylum at Still. In addition to these, collections are made for the work of the Childhood of Jesus (the ransom of <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> children); for the spread of the Faith; for home missions (<a href="13398b.htm">Society of St. Francis de Sales</a>); and for the assistance of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> students. Moreover, since State pensions for retired <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are not sufficient, the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a> have established a supplementary fund which amounted in 1902 to $4,096 (16,384 marks; in 1903, to $6079 (24,315 marks) to $4,667 (18,667 marks) in 1904, and to $5,271 (21,085 marks) in 1905.</p>

<h2>Elementary education</h2>

<p>An ordinance, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 18 April, 1871, and issued by Count von Bismarck-Bohlen, Governor-General of Alsace, obliges every child, on reaching the age of six, to attend either a public or a private <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, unless equivalent provision shall be made in the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> itself. School attendance continues to be <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> until the final examination, which, for boys, takes place at the age of fourteen, for girls at thirteen. The <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of 12 February placed all lower and higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> under the supervision and control of the State authorities. "In all <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>," so runs the ordinance of the Imperial Statthalter (Governor), <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 16 November, 1887 "religion, morality, respect for the State and the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> shall be inculcated by means of teaching and <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>." The normal curriculum of elementary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> comprises religion, German, arithmetic, geometry, drawing, history, geography, natural history, natural <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, singing, carpentry, and feminine handicrafts. The following are charged with the local supervision of each elementary <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>: the burgomaster, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>, the delegate of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a> and, in <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of more than 2,000 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, one or more residents appointed thereto by the President of the district. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> are especially charged with the supervision of the religious instruction given by the teachers in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>; they have, besides, the right of entering the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> at all times. The greater number of public elementary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> are denominational. Most of the masters are <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>; most of the mistresses, sisters of some teaching order. These communities, whose members teach in public, State, and municipal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, also maintain private elementary, intermediate, and higher girls' <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</p>

<h2>Art monuments</h2>

<p>Alsace-Lorraine is rich in important art monuments, the two principal being the world-famous minster of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>. The first was begun in 1015, and finished in July, 1439, and whereas the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Cologne presents an example of one style Gothic work, the minster at <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> bears traces of many styles. The <a href="04558a.htm">crypt</a> is early Romanesque, the choir and part of the <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a> late Romanesque, the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> and southern portion show the highest triumph of <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>. It is 110 metres (361 feet) long, and 47 metres (154 feet) wide; the tower is 142 metres (466 feet) high. The Gothic <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a> was begun under Bishop Conrad von Scharfenberg (1212-20), but was not <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> until 1546. In the eighteenth century an <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="15387a.htm">porch</a> was built at the west end, but was replaced at the beginning of the twentieth century by one corresponding to the style of the building itself. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is 122 metres (400 feet) long, 30 metres (98.4 feet) wide in the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a>, and 47 metres (154 feet) at the <a href="15018a.htm">transepts</a>. The two towers are unfinished. The oldest church in Strasburg is the Romanesque <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Stephen, said to have been built in the twelfth century; the oldest in Alsace, St Peter's collegiate church at Avolsheim, which dates to the eleventh.</p>

<h2>Institutions of charity</h2>

<p>In October, 1899, a charity organization was founded at <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, in connection with the Charity Society for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> (headquarters at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> im Breisgau). It has central offices at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Nancy, and is connected with the <em>Oeuvre Internationale de la protection de la jeune fille</em> of <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. This organization is the centre of all the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> benevolent <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> and institutions of Alsace-Lorraine. Its object is to make inquiries into actual and prospective causes of destitution, and to take special steps for their amelioration, to impart information relating to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and to <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> and undertakings, and to disseminate the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> principles of <a href="03592a.htm">Christian charity</a> by means of lectures and pamphlets. The sphere of these charitable <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> includes: &mdash;(1) Cr&ecirc;ches for infants, with protection and care of <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> children of both sexes during play hours.

It exists in all the <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Colmar and Muelhausen and in <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, where, between 1894 and 1897, it brought about 152 marriages between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 48 between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and 12 between <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

This <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> is connected with the International <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Society for the Protection of Girls; its object is to assist with advice and help unprotected, grown-up girls, house servants, factory girls, shop girls, teachers, and others, those, especially, who are away from home, and to shield them from dangers to <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>. Thirty-six visits were made to such girls during 1905, 561 letters received, and 765 written; 1,101 domestic servants were lodged in <a href="01686a.htm">St. Arbogast's</a> Home, 86 free, for 919 days, and 57 at a reduced price for 1,012 days. &mdash;(15) Young ladies' <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, twenty-four in number.

These provide assistance for the poorer members in case of sickness, and defray the burial fees in cases of death. &mdash;(17) Societies with social objects in eleven places.

There were as many as 600 members in 1906 in the Women's Union, the second year after its foundation. &mdash;(21) The aim of the youths' and men's <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, some of which were founded 200 years ago, but most of which were established within the last twenty years, is not merely to protect and strengthen the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of their members, but to assist them in their material interests. The first is attained by means of common worship and general communion; the second, in the case of young men, by means of social intercourse, lectures, the use of <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a>, athletics, music, and shooting contests, instruction in German, French, arithmetic, drawing, bookkeeping, and short hand; dramatic performances, savings and insurance funds, assistance to the sick and those doing military service, and finding situations; for older men by social intercourse, lectures, savings, loans, insurance for sickness and death funds, employment agencies, legal protection, and co-operative <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>. According to the latest returns published, there were 40 such youths' <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, in 1904, with 15,300, and 32 older men's <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> with 18,346 members. These do not include the three <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "Casinos" in <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, or those in Hazenau, Colmar, and Schlettstadt, or the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> students' <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> at the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. These last are Franconia, Merovingia, Staufia (Catholic Students' Union of the S.K.V.); Badenia, Rappolstein (Catholic Students' Association of S.C.V.); Erwinia (Catholic Students' Association of the S.C.V.); Unitas, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Science Students' Union, the Academic Society of St. Boniface, the Academic Marian Congregation and the Academic Conference of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>.</p>

<p>The following <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, which are gradually becoming firmly established in Alsace-Lorraine, should also be mentioned: the Society of the Supporters of the Centrum (Zentrumsverein), the Peoples' Union for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the Branch Unions for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schoolmasters and mistresses.
