<h2>Geography</h2>

<p>The province of Quebec occupies mainly the two slopes of the vast basin formed by the St. Lawrence River whose course runs chiefly between the Laurentian and Alleghany ranges. Its boundaries are: to the north, the district of <a href="15127a.htm">Ungava</a>; to the northeast, Labrador; to the east, the Gulf of St. Lawrence; to the southeast, New Brunswick, and the States of Maine and <a href="10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>; to the south, the States of Vermont and New York, and the Counties of Glengarry and Prescott in <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a>; to the west, the province of <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a>. Quebec is comprised between the 45th and 54th degrees of latitude north, and the 57th and 79th degrees of longitude west of Greenwich. Its area measures 354,873 square miles; about equal to that of the United Kingdom, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> united. No country in the world of the same extent possesses so many and so abundant waterways, chief of which are the St. Lawrence, discharging the Great Lakes, and navigable to its very source, and its principal tributaries: the Ottawa, the <a href="10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> and the Saguenay, each of which surpasses in navigableness the largest rivers of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Innumerable cascades falling from the Laurentian heights represent boundless mechanical forces; the forest resources of Quebec are still immense, and its asbestos mines the richest in the world. The principal cities are:</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Quebec, the capital, founded in 1608, population, according to the last census (1901), 68,840; <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> founded 1642, population, exclusive of lately annexed municipalities, 267,730; <a href="14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, founded 1634, population, 9981; Sherbrooke, 11,765; Hull, 13,993; Valleyfield, 11,055. Quebec, the capital, long enjoyed a political, military, and commercial superiority over all <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Although since surpassed in material prosperity, it still appeals to the scholar and student, teeming as it is with historical interest, while to the tourist it offers a view of magnificence and picturesqueness perhaps unique in the world. Here landed the discoverers of the country and the founders of the nation; hither came the bare-footed Recollect, the black-robed <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> and the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> Sisters; here the noble and saintly Laval ruled the infant Church of New France; from hence the Faith radiated throughout North America. Here was born Joliet, the discoverer of the Mississippi; here the viceroys held court; here flourished, from the very outset, many of the dearest devotions of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Laval's first <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated in 1666 to the Immaculate Conception; the cult of the Holy Family was approved in 1665, a fact lauded by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his Letter "Neminem fugit" (14 June, 1892); the first celebration of the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a> took place in the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> (1700); Traditions of courtesy as well as of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> were created that have left their impress on the people's character. Almost the entire population of the province of Quebec, i.e. about five-sixths, consists of French-Canadians; the remainder comprises chiefly the descendants of English, <a href="13613a.htm">Scotch</a>, and <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants. About 12,000 Indians and half-breeds of the <a href="08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, <a href="07565a.htm">Huron</a>, <a href="10283b.htm">Micmac</a>, Abenaki, and Montagnais tribes occupy reservations in different sections of the province. With one or two exceptions, these aborigines are instructed by missionaries in their respective tongues, which they have faithfully preserved in spite of their environment.</p>

<h2>Present conditions</h2>

<p>Although there is no state religion, and freedom of worship is sanctioned by law, the immense majority of the population being <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and practice, the relations between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> are, as a rule, harmonious. The <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> are habitually treated with due consideration and respect, in recognition not only of their sacred character, but also of the efficient part they have ever taken in the moral as well as the social well-being of the country. Public order, <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in every degree, agriculture, colonization, and even industry, all owe a <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> to the influence of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, which the political authorities are prone to recognize. In all public religious demonstrations, such as the procession of <a href="04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, the dignitaries of the State occupy a prominent rank. The province of Quebec comprises three <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a>: Quebec, <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and Ottawa. That of Quebec counts four suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: <a href="14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, <a href="13058a.htm">Rimouski</a>, <a href="03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a>, <a href="11069a.htm">Nicolet</a>, and one <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate apostolic</a>, the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> are: <a href="07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a>, <a href="13756d.htm">Sherbrooke</a>, <a href="15261a.htm">Valleyfield</a>, and <a href="08496b.htm">Joliette</a>. The <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Ottawa, partly situated in <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, comprises the <a href="11611a.htm">Diocese of Pembroke</a> and the Vicariate Apostolic of Temiscamingue. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the province, according to the last government census (1901), was 1,449,716, out of a total of 1,648,898. Later statistics (ecclesiastical), including 1910, show an increase for the two ecclesiastical provinces of Quebec and <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and exclusive of that portion of the civil province depending on the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Ottawa, of 163,611, giving a total <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population for 1910 of 1,613,327, Quebec and suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> having a total of 731,609, and <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, with its suffragans, of 789,502. This increase in a province where race-suicide is unknown and <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> proverbially numerous, in spite of a notable infantile death-rate, should be far greater, were it not for the continuous flow of emigration to the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and to the western provinces of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, with a comparatively small immigration from <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. This emigration of <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, according to authentic statistics, amounted to 10,000 for the single year of 1909. (For history, see <a href="03227a.htm">CANADA</a>.)</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3>Correction</h3>

<p>All penitentiaries and <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a> are provided with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> subsidized by the State, and feast-days of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, as well as Sunday, are observed. Reformatories for youth are managed at the public expense by the Brothers of Charity for older boys, by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd for girls, and by the Sisters of Charity for younger children of both sexes, the Government contributing in the last two cases a per capita sum for a limited number of juveniles. The two largest sanitaria in the province are managed, by government contract, by the Sisters of Providence and of Charity, in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and Quebec, respectively. Homes for idiots, enjoying government subsidies, are likewise in the care of religious. According to the latest criminal statistics (1908), the province of Quebec, with a ratio of 13.91 per 10,000 of population, comes fourth in order of excellence, after the three maritime provinces, where there has been no immigration within the last decade; and third for number of convictions according to population, being one for each 96 inhabitants, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick alone surpassing Quebec.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>The public-school system in the province of Quebec, without being ideal, is, in a notable measure, respectful of the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This desirable condition results mainly from the constitution of the Council of Public Instruction, composed, ex officio, of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the province representing the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of an equal number of <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The latter are nominated exclusively by the lieutenant governor in council. The council is presided over by a superintendent of public instruction who represents the State; there is no minister of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and politics are thereby partly excluded from the administration. Several principals of normal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and lay professors have lately been added to the council. The council has the power to distribute a limited portion of the public moneys for primary and classical <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, to propose certain nominees to normal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and to the board of examiners for teaching licences, to approve or reject all text-books. But its powers are more advisory than legislative, nearly all its deliberations being subject to government sanction. A committee similarly organized attends to the <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> interests of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minority. The most striking feature of the Quebec <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> law is the absolute liberty enjoyed by each of the two chief <a href="13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> of controlling its own <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> agreeably to the wishes of <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>. In municipalities where they form the majority, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> cannot interfere with the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and vice versa. In this respect, of all the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the dominion, that of Quebec may justly be considered as the fairest and most conducive to religious harmony; never was a majority so liberal towards a minority. The <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> grants are even proportionally larger to the latter (the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minority) than to the former. It has been rightly proclaimed that nowhere has the separate <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> law been more generously and conscientiously applied, and that, to the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of French <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Quebec, there has never been any occasion to invoke government interference for the protection of the minority. This fair treatment extends likewise to the language. The French-speaking province of Quebec amply provides for the requirements of the English-speaking minorities, as regards <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in their mother tongue. Moreover, a course of English, in many cases quite efficient, is given in every French <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the intermediate and higher grades. It must be noted that there is only one <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> law for the province, under which all <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, are organized. To interest the people more deeply in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and give greater unity and strength to the system, the legislature has grafted it on the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> organization. Each <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> is thus incorporated three times:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>for church affairs;</li><li>for municipal affairs;</li><li>for <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> affairs.</li></ul></div>

<p>The <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is eligible as <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> commissioner, and has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to visit the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> with the exclusive choice of textbooks relating to religion. In <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> where there is a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minority, the minority has a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to a dissentient separate <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, controlled by special trustees. Lay inspectors, nominated by the governor in council, visit all <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> under control of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> commissioners; <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> inspectors, chosen by the respective <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, are authorized to visit even <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> receiving a partial grant from the Government. Normal or training <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, based on the principle of denominationalism, were definitively created in 1857, two for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, one in Quebec for both sexes, the Laval, and one in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, the Jacques-Cartier, for male teachers, and one for <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, the McGill. Recently, normal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> teachers only have been established in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, <a href="13058a.htm">Rimouski</a>, <a href="03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a>, <a href="07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a>, Hull, <a href="13756d.htm">Sherbrooke</a>, <a href="15261a.htm">Valleyfield</a>, <a href="11069a.htm">Nicolet</a>, and Joliette, under the management of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, and grafted on pre-existing <a href="13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>. In each of the ten <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> normal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of the province, the principal is a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> nominated by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> committee. Another late improvement is the establishment of special <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of domestic economy under the management of sisters. (For legislation relating to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, see <a href="03227a.htm">CANADA</a>.)</p>

<p>The latest report of the superintendent of public <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> for the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> year 1909-10 gives the following general statistics for the province of Quebec: <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, 6760; teachers, 14,000; pupils, 394,945; average attendance, 308,982; average per cent, 78.23. The same report shows an increase above the figures of the year previous of 7552 in the number of pupils. There has also been a considerable increase in the expenditure, due to grants for technical <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and to the newly organized normal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The total government outlay for 1909-10 was $6,210,530, showing an increase above that of 1907-08 of $1,744,993. The contrast between the amount spent and the number of <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, teachers, and pupils, instead of signifying an inferior quality of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, testifies to the economy wrought by the employment of teaching <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 5805 of whose members (out of a total of 14,000 teachers) are employed in the public <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. (For statistics regarding <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, classical colleges, and the several teaching orders, see <a href="03227a.htm">CANADA</a>.)</p>

<p>The accompanying table of comparative <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> statistics for the entire dominion was published officially by the Department of the Interior in 1908. (Those marked with an asterisk are estimated.)</p>

<p>Of the two oldest provinces of the dominion, <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a> and Quebec, the latter stands first as regards the number of <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, of teachers, and of average attendance, being inferior only in the number of pupils (irrespective of the ratio to each population), and in expenditure. About one-eleventh of the number of pupils in the province of Quebec are non-Catholics. The following table, based on the preceding statistics, shows the relative standing of each province of the dominion, according to the percentage of average attendance for 1908:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><em>Alberta</em>: 17,311 average attendance (44.26%)</li><li><em>British Columbia</em>: 23,558 average attendance (70.71%)</li><li><em>Manitoba</em>: 37,279 average attendance (55.52%)</li><li><em>New Brunswick</em>: 38,584 average attendance (56.42%)</li><li><em>Nova Scotia</em>: 58,343 average attendance (57.35%)</li><li><em>Ontario</em>: 284,988 average attendance (59.55%)</li><li><em>Prince Edward Island</em>: 11,646 average attendance (64.65%)</li><li><em>Quebec</em>: 285,418 average attendance (76.36%)</li><li><em>Saskatchewan</em>: 19,841 average attendance (52.73%)  </li></ul></div>
