<h1>Election of the Popes</h1>

<p><em>For current procedures regarding the election of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, see Pope John Paul II's 1996 <a href="01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a></em> <a href="../library/docs_jp02ud.htm"> UNIVERSI DOMINICI GREGIS</a>. <em>See also</em> <a href="11456a.htm">PAPAL ELECTIONS</a> and <a href="04192a.htm">CONCLAVE</a>.</p>

<p>The supreme headship of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is, we have seen, annexed to the office of <a href="12260a.htm">Roman bishop</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> becomes chief <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> because he is <a href="12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>: he does not become <a href="12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> because he has been chosen to be head of the <a href="03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus, an election to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> is, properly speaking, primarily an election to the local <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to elect their <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has ever belonged to the members of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. They possess the prerogative of giving to the universal Church her chief <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>; they do not receive their <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in virtue of his election by the universal Church. This is not to say that the election should be by popular vote of the Romans. In <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs it is always for the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> to guide the decisions of the flock. The choice of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> belongs to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>: it may be confined to the leading members of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It is so in the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> at present. The electoral <a href="03333b.htm#x">college of cardinals</a> exercise their office because they are the chief of the Roman <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Should the <a href="03333b.htm#x">college of cardinals</a> ever become extinct, the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of choosing a supreme <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> would fall, not on the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled in council, but upon the remaining Roman <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. At the time of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, thinking it possible that in the event of his death the council might lay some claim to the right, insisted on this point in a consistorial allocution.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It is thus plain that a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> cannot nominate his successor. History tells us of one <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> &#151; <a href="02427d.htm">Benedict II</a> (530) &#151; who meditated adopting this course. But he recognized that it would be a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> step, and burnt the document which he had drawn up for the purpose. On the other hand the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> canon law (10 D. 79) supposes that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> may make provision for the needs of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by suggesting to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> some one whom he regards as fitted for the office: and we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> secured in this way the election of <a href="15410a.htm">Victor III</a>. Such a step, however, does not in any way fetter the action of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> can, further, legislate regarding the mode in which the subsequent election shall be carried out, determining the composition of the electoral college, and the conditions requisite for a definitive choice. The method at present followed is the result of a series of enactments on this subject.</p>

<p>A brief historical review will show how the principle of election by the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> has been maintained through all the vicissitudes of papal elections. <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> tells us in regard to the election of <a href="04375c.htm">Pope St. Cornelius</a> (251) that the comprovincial <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the people all took part in it: "He was made <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and of His <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, by the testimony of nearly all the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, by the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of aged <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> [<em>sacerdotum</em>], and of good men"(Ep. Iv ad Anton., n. 8). And a precisely similar ground is alleged by the Roman <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in their letter to <a href="07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> regarding the validity of the election of <a href="02658a.htm">Boniface I</a> (A.D. 418; P.L., XX, 750). Previous to the fall of the Western Empire interference by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a> seems to have been inconsiderable. Constantius, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, endeavoured to set up an <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="06030a.htm">Felix II</a> (355), but the act was universally regarded as <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a>. Honorius on the occasion of the contested election of 418 decreed that, when the election was dubious, neither party should hold the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, but that a new election should take place. This method was applied at the elections of <a href="04258a.htm">Conon</a> (686) and <a href="13728b.htm">Sergius I</a> (687). The law is found in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> code (c. 8, d. LXXIX), though Gratian declares it void of force as having emanated from civil and not <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority (d. XCVI, proem.; d. XCVII, proem.). After the barbarian conquest of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> were less carefully observed. Basilius, the prefect of Odoacer, claimed the right of supervising the election of 483 in the name of his master, alleging that <a href="14002a.htm">Pope Simplicius</a> had himself requested him to do so (Hard., II, 977). The disturbances which occurred at the disputed election of Symmachus (498) led that <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to hold a council and to <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> the severest penalties on all who should be guilty of canvassing or bribery in order to attain the pontificate. It was moreover decided that the majority of votes should decide the election. <a href="14576a.htm">Theodoric the Ostrogoth</a>, who at this period ruled <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, became in his later years a persecutor of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He even went so far as to appoint <a href="06031a.htm">Felix III (IV)</a> in 526 as the successor of <a href="08421a.htm">Pope John I</a>, whose death was due to the incarceration to which the king had condemned him. <a href="06031a.htm">Felix</a>, however, was personally worthy of the office, and the appointment was confirmed by a subsequent election. The precedent of interference set by <a href="14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> was fruitful of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. After the destruction of the Gothic monarchy (537), the Byzantine emperors went even farther than the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="11347d.htm">Ostrogoth</a> in encroaching on <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. <a href="15427b.htm">Vigilius</a> (540) and <a href="11602a.htm">Pelagius I</a> (553) were forced on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at imperial dictation. In the case of the latter there seems to have been no election: his title was validated solely through his recognition as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> by <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. The formalities of election at this time were as follows (<a href="09215c.htm">Lib. Diurnus Rom. Pont.</a>, 2, in P.L., CV, 27). After the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> death, the <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, the <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and the <a href="12426a.htm">primicerius</a> of the notaries sent an official notification to the <a href="05676b.htm">exarch</a> at <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. On the third day after the decease the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was elected, being invariably chosen from among the <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> (cf. op. cit., 2, titt. 2, 3 5), and an embassy was despatched to Constantinople to request the official confirmation of the election. Not until this had been received did the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> take place. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> acquired greater freedom after the Lombard invasion of 568 had destroyed the prestige of Byzantine power in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. <a href="11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> (,578) and <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> (590) were the spontaneous choice of the electors. And in 684, owing to the long delays involved in the journey to Constantinople, Constantine IV (Pogonatus) acceded to <a href="02427d.htm">Benedict II's</a> request that in future it should not be <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to wait for confirmation, but that a mere notification of the election would suffice. The 1088 of the exarchate and the <a href="07620a.htm">iconoclastic heresy</a> of the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> court completed the severance between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Eastern Empire, and <a href="15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a> (741) dispensed altogether with the customary notice to Constantinople.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 769 a council was held under <a href="14289a.htm">Stephen III</a> to rectify the confusion caused by the intrusion of the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> Constantine. This usurper was a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> hurriedly raised to <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders to render his <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the pontificate possible. To make a repetition of the <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> impossible it was decreed that only members of the sacred college were eligible for election. The part of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> was, moreover, reduced to a mere right of acclamation. Under <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and Louis the Pious the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> retained her freedom. Lothair, however, claimed more ample <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> for the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>. In 824 he exacted an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> from the Romans that none should be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> without the permission and the presence of his ambassadors. This was, in fact, done at most of the elections during the ninth century, and in 898 the riots which ensued upon the death of <a href="14289c.htm">Pope Stephen V</a> led <a href="08425a.htm">John IX</a> to give <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sanction to this system of imperial control. In a council held at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in that year he decreed that the election should be made by <a href="03333b.htm#b">bishops (cardinal)</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, regard being had to the wishes of the people, but that no <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> should take place except in the presence of the imperial <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> (Mansi XVIII, 225).</p>

<p>The due formalities at least of election appear to have been observed through the wild disorders which followed the collapse of the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Empire: and the same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> as regards the times of <a href="11354a.htm">Otto the Great</a> and his <a href="11355a.htm">son</a>. Under the restored empire, however, the electors enjoyed no freedom of choice. <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a> even compelled the Romans to swear that they would never elect or ordain a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> without his or his son's consent (963; cf. <a href="09313a.htm">Liutprand</a>, "Hist. Ott.", viii). In 1046 the <a href="13506d.htm">scandals</a> of the preceding elections, in which the supreme pontificate had become a prize for rival factions entirely regardless of what means they employed, led <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people to leave the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> to <a href="07228a.htm">Henry III</a>. Three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> were chosen in this manner. But <a href="09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> insisted that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was free in the choice of her <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and, until he was duly elected at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, declined to assume any of the state of his office. The party of reform, of which <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> was the moving spirit, were eager for some measure which should restore an independent choice to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This was carried out by <a href="11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>. In 1059 he held a council in the Lateran and issued the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> "In Nomine". This document is found in two recensions, a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> and an imperial, both of early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>. There is however little <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> recension embodied in the "Decretum Gratiani" (c. 1. d. XXIII) is genuine, and that the other was altered in the interest of the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="07063a.htm">Guibert</a>. The right of election is confined to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, the effective choice being placed in the hands of the <a href="03333b.htm#b">cardinal bishops</a>: <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people have a right of acclamation only. The right of confirmation is granted to the <a href="07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a> and to such of his successors as should personally request and receive the privilege. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> need not necessarily be taken from the number of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, though this should be the case if possible.</p>

<p>This <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> formed the basis of the present legislation on the papal election, though the system underwent considerable development. The first important modification was the Constitution "Licet de Vitanda" [c. vi, X, "De elect." (I, 6)] of <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, the first of the decrees passed by the <a href="09017b.htm">Third Oecumenical Council of the Lateran</a> (1179). To prevent the evils of a disputed election it was established by this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> that no one should be held to be elected until two thirds of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> should have given their votes for him. In this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> no distinction is made between the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03333b.htm#b">cardinal bishops</a> and those of the rest of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. The imperial privilege of confirming the election had already become obsolete owing to the breach between the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Empire under <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> and <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick I</a>. Between the death of <a href="04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> (1268) and the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> (1272) an interregnum of nearly three years intervened. To prevent a repetition of so great a misfortune the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the Council of Lyons (1179) issued the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Ubi periculum" [c. iii, "De elect.", in 60 (I, 6)], by which it was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> that during the election of a pontiff the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> should be secluded from the world under exceedingly stringent regulations, and that the seclusion should continue till they had fulfilled their <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of providing the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> with a supreme <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>. To this electoral session was given the name of the <a href="04192a.htm">Conclave</a>. This system prevails at the present day.</p>
