<p>The rite used by the Jacobite <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrians is in its origin simply the old rite of Antioch in the Syriac language. Into this framework the Jacobites have fitted a great number of other <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a>, so that now their Liturgy has more variant forms than any other. The oldest form of the Antiochene Rite that we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> is in Greek (see <a href="01571a.htm">ANTIOCHENE LITURGY</a>). It was apparently composed in that language. The many Greek terms that remain in the <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a> form show that this is derived from Greek. The version must have been made very early, evidently before the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, before the influence of Constantinople and Byzantine infiltrations had begun. No <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> as soon as <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities arose in the country parts of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> which in the cities (Antioch, <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, etc.) were said in Greek, were, as a matter of course, translated into the peasants' language (Syriac) for their use. The "Peregrinatio Silviae" describes the services at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as being Greek; but the lessons, first read in Greek, are then translated into Syriac <em>propter populum</em>. As long as all Western <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> was one communion, the country <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> followed the rite of the patriarch at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, only changing the language. Modifications adopted at Antioch in Greek were copied in Syriac by those who said their <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the national tongue. This point is important because the Syriac Liturgy (in its fundamental form) already contains all the changes brought to Antioch from <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It is not the older pure Antiochene Rite, but the later Rite of Jerusalem-Antioch. "St. James", <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a> first not for the <a href="01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>, but "for the holy Sion, the mother of all churches" (Brightman, pp. 89-90). The fact that the Jacobites as well as the Orthodox have the Jerusalem-Antiochene Liturgy is the chief <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that this had supplanted the older Antiochene use before the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> of the fifth century.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Our first Syriac documents come from about the end of the fifth century ("Testamentum Domini," ed. by Ignatius Rahmani II, Life of Severus of Antioch, sixth century). They give us valuable information about local forms of the Rite of Antioch-Jerusalem. The Jacobite <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> kept a version of this rite which is obviously a local variant. Its scheme and most of its <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> correspond to those of the Greek St. James; but it has amplifications and omissions, such as we find in all local forms of early rites. It seems too that the Jacobites after the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> made some modifications. We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> this for certain in one point (the Trisagion). The first Jacobite writer on their rite is <a href="08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a> (d. 708), who wrote a letter to a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Thomas comparing the Syrian Liturgy with that of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. This letter is an exceedingly valuable and really critical discussion of the rite. A number of later Jacobite writers followed <a href="08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a>. On the whole this <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> produced the first scientific students of liturgy. Benjamin of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> (period unknown), Lazarus bar Sabhetha of <a href="02202c.htm">Bagdad</a> (ninth century), Moses bar Kephas of Mosul (d. 903), Dionysuis bar Salibhi of <a href="01429c.htm">Amida</a> (d. 1171) wrote valuable commentaries on the Jacobite Rite. In the eighth and ninth centuries a controversy concerning the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> at the Fraction produced much <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> literature. The chronicle of their Patriarch Michael the Great (d. 1199) discusses the question and supplies valuable contemporary documents.</p>

<p>The oldest Jacobite Liturgy extant is the one ascribed (as in its Greek form) to St. James. It is in the dialect of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. The pro-anaphoral part of this is the <em>Ordo communis</em> to which the other later <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> are joined. It is printed in Latin by <a href="12769a.htm">Renaudot</a> (II, 1-44) and in English by Brightman (pp. 69-110). This follows the Greek St. James (see <a href="01571a.htm">ANTIOCHENE LITURGY</a>) with these differences. All the vesting <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and preparation of the offering (<em>Proskomide</em>) are considerably expanded, and the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> differ. This part of the Liturgy is most subject to modification; it began as private <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> only. The <em>Monogenes</em> comes later; the <a href="09286a.htm">litany</a> before the lessons is missing; the <a href="07716a.htm">incensing</a> is expanded into a more elaborate rite. The <em>Trisagion</em> comes after the lessons from the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; it contains the addition: "who wast crucified for us". This is the most famous characteristic of the Jacobite Rite. The clause was added by Peter the Dyer (Fullo), <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (d. 488), was believed to imply Monophysism and caused much controversy during these times, eventually becoming a kind of watchword to the Jacobites (see Zacharias Rhetor, "Hist. eccl.", PG 85, 1165). The <a href="09286a.htm">litany</a> between the lessons is represented by the word <em>Kurillison</em> said thrice. There is no chant at the Great Entrance (a Byzantine addition in the <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>). The long <a href="11217a.htm">Offertory</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> do not occur. The <a href="05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a> and Intercession are much the same as in Greek. The <a href="09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> follows the Fraction. At the Communion-litany the answer is <em>Halleluiah</em> instead of <em>Kyrie eleison</em>.</p>

<p>In this Syriac Liturgy many Greek forms remain: <em>Stomen kalos, Kurillison, Sophia, Proschomen,</em> etc. <a href="12769a.htm">Renaudot</a> gives also a second form of the <em>Ordo communis</em> (II, 12-28) with many variants. To the <em>Ordo communis</em> the Jacobites have added a very great number of alternative <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a>, many of which have not been published. These <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> are ascribed to all manner of people; they were composed at very different periods. One explanation of their attribution to various <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> is that they were originally used on their feasts.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><a href="12769a.htm">Renaudot</a> translated and published thirty-nine of these.

<p>Brightman (pp. lviii-lix) mentions sixty-four Liturgies as known, at least by name. Notes of this bewildering number of <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> will be found after each in <a href="12769a.htm">Renaudot</a>. In most cases all he can say is that he knows nothing of the real author; often the names affixed are otherwise unknown. Many <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> are obviously quite late, inflated with long <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> and rhetorical, expressions, many contain <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, some are insufficient at the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> so as to be invalid. Baumstark (Die Messe im Morgenland, 44-46) thinks the <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of St. Ignatius most important, as containing parts of the old pure Antiochene Rite. He considers that many attributions to later Jacobite authors may be correct, that the Liturgy of <a href="07644a.htm">Ignatius of Antioch</a> (Joseph Ibn Wahib; d. 1304) is the latest. Most of these <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> have now fallen into disuse. The Jacobite celebrant generally uses the shortened form of St. James. There is an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> version (shortened) of the Syriac St. James. The Liturgy is said in Syriac with (since the fifteenth century) many Arabic substitutions in the lessons and proanaphoral <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The Lectionary and Diaconicum have not been published and are badly known. The vestments correspond almost exactly to those of the Orthodox, except that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> wears a latinized <a href="10404a.htm">mitre</a>. The Calendar has few feasts. It follows in its main lines the older of Antioch, observed also by the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, which is the basis of the Byzantine Calendar. Feasts are divided into three classes of dignity. Wednesday and Friday are fast-days. The <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> consists of <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a>, <a href="11087b.htm">Nocturns</a>, <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, and None, or rather of hours that correspond to these among Latins. <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> always belongs to the following day. The great part of this consists of long poems composed for the purpose, like the Byzantine odes. Baptism is performed by immersion; the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> confirms at once with <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> blessed by the patriarch. Confession is not much used; it has fallen into the same decay as in most <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>. Communion is administered under both kinds; the sick are anointed with oil blessed by a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> &#151; the ideal is to have seven <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to administer it. The orders are <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, <a href="09111a.htm">lector</a>, and singer. There are many <a href="16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>, not <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It will be seen, then, that one little Jacobite Church has followed much the same line of development in its rites as its powerful Orthodox neighbour.</p>

<p>The Syrian <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> use the same rite as the Jacobites. But (as is the case with most Eastern Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches) it is better organized with them. There is not much that can be called Romanizing in their books; but they have the advantage of well-arranged, well-edited, and well-printed books. All the great students of the West-Syrian Rite (the Assemani, <a href="12769a.htm">Renaudot</a>, etc.) have been <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Their <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the higher Western standard of scholarship in general are advantages of which the Syrian <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> rather than the Jacobites profit. Of the manifold Syrian <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> use seven only &#151; those of St. James, St.John, St. Peter, <a href="08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>, <a href="14031b.htm">St. Xystus</a>, St. Mathew, and St. Basil. That of <a href="14031b.htm">St. Xystus</a> is attached to the <em>Ordo communis</em> in their official book; that of St. John is said on the chief feasts. The lessons only are in Arabic. It was inevitable that the Syrian Liturgies, coming from <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> sources, should be examined at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> before they are allowed to Syrian <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. But the revisers made very few changes. Out of the mass of <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphoras</a> they chose the oldest and purest, leaving out the long series of later ones that were unorthodox, or even invalid. In the seven kept for Syrian <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> use what alterations have been made chiefly the omission of redundant <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, simplification of confused parts in which the Diaconicum and the Euchologion had become mixed together. The only important correction is the omission of the fatal clause: "Who was crucified for us" in the Trisagion. There is no suspicion of modifying in the direction of the <a href="13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. The other books of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> &#151; the Diaconicum, <a href="02768b.htm">officebook</a>, and ritual &#151; are edited at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, and the Patriarchal press Sharf&eacute;; they are considerably the most accessible, the best-arranged books in which to study this rite.</p>

<p>The West-Syrian Rite has also been used at intervals by sections of the (schismatical) Malabar Church. Namely, as the Malabar <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> at various times made approaches to the Jacobite Patriarch or received <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> from him, so did they at such times use his Liturgy. Most of Malabar has now returned to the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> communion; but there are still Jacobite communities using this rite among them.</p>

<p>The <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite Rite</a> is merely a <a href="09022a.htm">Romanized</a> adaptation of that of the West Syrians.</p>
