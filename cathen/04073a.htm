<p>(CLUNI, CLUGNI, or CLUGNY)</p>

<p>The earliest <a href="12711a.htm">reform</a>, which became practically a distinct order, within the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. It originated at Cluny, a town in Saone-et-Loire, fifteen miles northwest of <a href="09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, where in 910 William the Pious, Duke of Aquitaine, founded an <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> and endowed it with his entire domain. Over it he placed St. Berno, then <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Gigny, under whose guidance a somewhat new and stricter form of <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> life was inaugurated. The reforms introduced at Cluny were in some measure traceable to the influence of <a href="02467a.htm">St. Benedict of Aniane</a>, who had put forward his new <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> at the first great meeting of the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the order held at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a> (Aix-la-Chapelle) in 817, and their development at Cluny resulted in many departures from precedent, chief among which was a highly centralized form of government entirely foreign to <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> tradition. The reform quickly spread beyond the limits of the Abbey of Cluny, partly by the founding of new houses and partly by the incorporation of those already existing, and as all these remained dependent upon the mother-house, the Congregation of Cluny came into being almost automatically. Under St. Berno's successors it attained a very widespread influence, and by the twelfth century Cluny was at the head of an order consisting of some 314 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. These were spread over <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the Empire, <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>. According to the "Bibliotheca Cluniacensis" (Paris, 1614) 825 houses owed allegiance to the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny in the fifteenth century. Some writers have given the number as 2000, but there is little <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this is an exaggeration. It may perhaps include all those many other <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which, though no joining the congregation, adopted either wholly or in part the Cluny constitutions, such as Fleury, Hirschau, <a href="05785d.htm">Farfa</a>, and many others that were subject to their influence.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>During the first 250 years of its existence Cluny was governed by a series of remarkable <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, men who have left their mark upon the history of Western <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and who were prominently concerned with all the great political questions of their day. Among these were Sts. Odo, Mayeul, Odilo, and Hugh, and Peter the Venerable. Under the last named, the ninth <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, who ruled from 1122 to 1156, Cluny reached the zenith of its influence and prosperity, at which time it was second only to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the chief centre of the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. It became a home of learning and a training <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, four of whom, <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII (Hildebrand)</a>, <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, Paschal II, and <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a>, were called from its <a href="04060a.htm">cloisters</a> to rule the Universal Church. In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> the Cluniac houses numbered thirty-five at the time of the dissolution. There were three in <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The earliest foundation was that of the <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of St. Pancras at Lewes (1077), the <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of which usually held the position of <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny for <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Other important English houses were at Castleacre, Montacute, <a href="11107b.htm">Northampton</a>, and Bermondsey.</p>

<p>After the twelfth century the power of Cluny declined somewhat, and in the sixteenth century it suffered much through the civil and religious <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and their consequences. The introduction also of commendatory <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, the first of whom was appointed in 1528, was to some extent responsible for its decline. Amongst the greatest of its titular <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> were <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> and <a href="10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>, who tried to restore it to some of its former greatness, though their efforts did not meet with much success. Claude de Vert, Prior of Saint-Pierre, Abbeville (d. 1708), was another would-be reformer of the congregation, inspired no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> by the example of the <a href="10069b.htm">Maurists</a>.</p>

<p>The abbey-church of Cluny was on a scale commensurate with the greatness of the congregation, and was regarded as one of the wonders of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. It was no less than 555 feet in length, and was the largest church in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> until the erection of St. Peter's at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It consisted of five <a href="10724a.htm">naves</a>, a <a href="10704b.htm">narthex</a>, or ante-church, and several towers. Commenced by <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>, the sixth <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, in 1089, it was finished and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a> in 1131-32, the <a href="10704b.htm">narthex</a> being added in 1220. Together with the conventual buildings it covered an area of twenty-five acres. At the suppression in 1790 it was bought by the town and almost entirely destroyed. At the present day only one tower and part of a <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a> remain, whilst a road traverses the site of the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a>. The community of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which had numbered three hundred in the thirteenth century, dwindled down to one hundred in the seventeenth, and when it was suppressed, in common with all the other <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, its <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> numbered only forty.</p>

<p>The spirit and organization of the congregation was a distinct departure from the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> tradition, though its <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> continued all along to be recognized as members of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. Previous to its inception every <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> had been independent and autonomous, though the observance of the same rule in all constituted a bond of union; but when Cluny began to throw out offshoots and to draw other houses under its influence, each such house, instead of forming a separate <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, was retained in absolute dependence upon the central <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The superiors of such houses, which were usually <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a>, were subject to the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny and were his nominees, not the <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> of their own communities, as is the normal <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> custom. Every profession, even in the most distant <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the congregation, required his sanction, and every <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> had to pass some years at Cluny itself. Such a system cut at the root of the old <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> ideal and resulted in a kind of <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> consisting of one great central <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and a number of dependencies spread over many lands. The <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny or his representative made annual visitations of the dependent houses, and he had for his assistant in the government of so vast an organization a coadjutor with the title Grand-Prior of Cluny. The <a href="01015c.htm">abbot's</a> monarchical status was somewhat curtailed after the twelfth century by the holding of general chapters, but it is evident that he possessed a very real power over the whole congregation, so long as he held in his own hands the appointment of all the dependent <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a>. (For the sources of information as to the rule, government, and conventual observance of the congregation, see bibliography at end of this article.) With regard to the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny conformed to the then prevailing custom, introduced into the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by <a href="02467a.htm">St. Benedict of Aniane</a>, of adding numerous extra devotional exercises, in the shape of psalms (<em>psalmi familiares, speciales, prostrati,</em> and <em>pro tribulatione</em>) and votive offices (<a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, The Dead, All Saints, etc.) to the daily <a href="07500b.htm">canonical hours</a> prescribed by the <a href="02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of Cluny was for many centuries one of the richest and most important in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the storehouse of a vast number of most valuable <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. When the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> was sacked by the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, in 1562, many of these priceless treasures perished and others were dispersed. Of those that were left at Cluny, some were burned by the <a href="13009a.htm">revolutionary</a> mob at the time of the suppression in 1790, and others stored away in the Cluny town hall. These latter, as well as others that passed into private hands, have been gradually recovered by the French Government and are now in the Bibliotheque Nationale at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. There are also in the British Museum, London, about sixty charters which formerly belonged to Cluny. The "Hotelde Cluny" in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, dating from 1334, was formerly the town house of the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>. In 1833 it was made into a public museum, but apart from the name thus derived, it possesses practically nothing connected with the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>.</p>
