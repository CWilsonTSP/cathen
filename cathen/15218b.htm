<p>Maffeo Barberini, born at Florence in April, 1568; elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, 6 August, 1623; died at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 29 July, 1644.</p>

<p>His father Antonio Barberini, a Florentine nobleman, who died when Maffeo was only three years old, his mother, Camilla Barbadoro, brought him to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> at an early age. He lived with his uncle, Francesco Barberini, who was then prothonotary Apostolic, and was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Collegio Romano under the direction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1589 he graduated from <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> as Doctor of Laws, and returning to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he became abbreviator Apostolic and referendary of the Segnatura di Giustizia. In 1592 <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> made him Governor of <a href="05785a.htm">Fano</a>, then prothonotary Apostolic, and in 1601 <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to present his felicitations to <a href="07225a.htm">King Henry IV</a> on the birth of the dauphin, the future King Louis XIII. In 1604 he was appointed <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> and sent as <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he became very influential with <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>. In recognition of his services in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a> created him <a href="03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a>, 11 September, 1606, with the titular Church of S. Pietro in Montorio, which he exchanged for that of S. Onofrio, 5 September, 1610. On 17 October, 1608, he was transferred to the <a href="14232b.htm">See of Spoleto</a>, where he convened a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a>, completed the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and built two other <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, at Spello and Visso. In 1617 <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a> made him <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> of Bologna and prefect of the Segnatura di Giustizia. On 19 July, 1623, fifty-five <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> entered <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> to elect a successor to <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>; on 6 August Cardinal Maffeo Barberini received fifty votes. The new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> took the name of Urban VIII. Being attacked by the fever which was raging in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to postpone his <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> until 29 September. It is related that, before allowing himself to be vested in the pontifical robes, he prostrated himself before the altar, <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> might let him die if his pontificate would not be for the good of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>He began his reign by issuing on the very day of his election the <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Philip Neri, Ignatius Loyola, and Francis Xavier, who had been <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>. Urban himself <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="05391a.htm">Elizabeth of Portugal</a>, 25 May, 1625; and Andrew Corsini, 22 April, 1629. He <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a>:</p>

<p>He reserved the <a href="02364b.htm">beatification</a> of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and in a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 30 October, 1625, forbade the representation with the halo of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> not <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> or <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a>, the placing of lamps, tablets, etc., before their sepulchres, and the printing of their alleged <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> or revelations. In a later <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 September, 1642, he reduced the number of holy days of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to thirty-four, besides <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. Urban introduced many new offices into the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. He composed the whole proper Office of St. Elizabeth and wrote the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, as they are in the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, for the feasts of <a href="09730a.htm">St. Martina</a>, St. Hermenegild, and <a href="05391a.htm">St. Elizabeth of Portugal</a>. A book of poems, written by him before he became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, was published during his pontificate under the title: "Maphei Cardinalis Barberini poemata" (Rome, 1637). In 1629 he appointed a committee for the reform of the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. Their incomplete and often ill-advised corrections were approved by Urban, 19 September, 1631, and embodied in the official edition of the <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> which was issued the following year (see <a href="02768b.htm">BREVIARY</a> &#151; <em>Reforms of the Breviary</em>). In 1627 Urban gave the final shape to the celebrated <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="07717c.htm">"In Coena Domini"</a>. In 1634 he enjoined upon all ruling <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, including <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, to observe the episcopal residence as decreed at the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. During Urban's pontificate occurred the second trial and condemnation of <a href="06342b.htm">Galileo</a> by the <a href="08026a.htm">Roman Inquisition</a>. On 6 March, 1642, he issued the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "In eminenti," condemning the "Augustinus" of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>.</p>

<p>Urban was a great patron of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> foreign missions. He erected various <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and vicariates in <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> countries and encouraged the missionaries by word and financial assistance. He extended the sphere of activity for the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>, and in 1627 founded the Collegium Urbanum, whose object was the training of missionaries for foreign countries. For the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> he had already founded (1625) a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> on Mount Lebanon. In order to increase the number of missionaries in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> he opened these two countries to all missionaries in 1633, although <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> had given the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> the exclusive right to those missions in 1585. In a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 April, 1639, he strictly prohibited slavery of any kind among the Indians of Paraguay, <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, and the entire West Indies. In his efforts to restore <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> Urban had little success. In 1624 he sent Richard Smith as <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> to that country, but the latter's imprudent insistence on exercising full episcopal authority in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a> brought him into public conflict with the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and other missionaries of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The Government issued new hostile measures against the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and in 1631 Smith was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee. Three years later Urban sent <a href="11450b.htm">Gregorio Panzani</a> to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Having gained greater liberty for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, he was succeeded in 1638 by George Conn, an Englishman, who had previously been secretary to Cardinal Francesco Barberini. Forced to return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1639, on account of ill-health, he was replaced by Rossetti. Repeated requests made through him to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> for financial aid in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> brewing between the king and Parliament were refused by Urban except on condition of the king's conversion. The ensuing <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> put an end to all negotiations. (See the letters of Panzani, Conn, and Rossetti to Cardinal Barberini in the Record Office Transcripts.) The <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders found a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoter in Urban. In 1628 he approved the Congregation of Our Saviour, a reformed branch of <a href="03288a.htm">Augustinian canons</a>, founded by Peter Fourier in 1609, and in 1632, the <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> or Priests of the Mission, a secular congregation founded by Vincent of Paul. He also approved the following sisterhoods: Canonesses of the Holy Sepulchre, 1631; Sisters of the Incarnation, 1633; Nuns of Our Lady of <a href="10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, 1634; and Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy, 1642. The <a href="08054a.htm">Jesuitesses</a>, founded by the Englishwoman <a href="15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a> in 1609, he suppressed in 1631 for insubordination.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Urban's greatest fault was his excessive nepotism. Three days after his <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> he created Francesco Barberini, his nephew, <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; in 1627 he made him librarian of the Vatican; and in 1632 vice-chancellor. Francesco did not abuse his power. He built the large Barberini Palace and founded the famous Barberini Library which was acquired and made part of the Vatican Library by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1902. Urban's nephew, Antonio Barberini, the Younger, was created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1627, became <em>camerlengo</em> in 1638, then commander-in-chief of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> troops. He was <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and <a href="15221b.htm">Urbino</a> in 1633; at Bologna, <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and Romagna in 1641. Urban's brother Antonio, who was a <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, received the Diocese of Senigaglia in 1625, was created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1628, and later appointed grand penitentiary and librarian of the Vatican. A third nephew of Urban, Taddeo Barberini, was made Prince of <a href="11421a.htm">Palestrina</a> and Prefect of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It is scarcely credible what immense riches accrued to the Barberini <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> through Urban's nepotism. Finally, tormented with scruples concerning his nepotism, Urban twice appointed a special committee of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> to investigate whether it was lawful for his nephews to retain their possessions, but each time the committee decided in favour of his nephews. Among the members of the second committee were Cardinal Lugo and Father Lupis.</p>

<p>In the government of the Papal territory Urban, as a rule, followed his own judgment; even his nephews had little influence during the first ten years of his pontificate. He <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> by ordering them to give precedence only to <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> heads, and in a <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 10 June, 1630, bestowed upon them the title of "Eminence," their former title having been "Illustrious and Most Reverend." In 1626 he extended the Papal territory by inducing the aged Duke Francesco Maria della Rovere to cede his Duchy of <a href="15221b.htm">Urbino</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Towards the end of his pontificate his nephews involved him in a useless <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with Odoardo Farnese, the Duke of <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a>, with whom they had quarrelled on questions of etiquette during his visit to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1639. In revenge they induced Urban to prohibit the exportation of grain from Castro to the Roman territory, thus depriving Farnese of an income without which he could not pay the interest on his <em>monti</em>, or bonds. The duke's creditors complained to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who took forcible possession of Castro, 13 October, 1641, in order to assure the payment. This <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> ineffective, and on 13 January, 1642, Urban <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Farnese and deprived him of all his fiefs. Backed by <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, <a href="10413a.htm">Modena</a>, and <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, the duke set out towards <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the head of about 3000 horsemen, putting to flight the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> troops. Peace negotiations were concluded near <a href="11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, but not accepted by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. In 1643 hostilities were renewed and continued without decisive success until the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> finally concluded a disgraceful peace on 31 March, 1644. He was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to free the duke from the ban and restore all the places taken by the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> troops.</p>

<p>Urban spent heavy sums on armaments, fortifications, and structures of every kind. At Castelfranco he erected the costly but unfavourably situated Fort Urbano, established an extensive manufactory of arms at <a href="14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, and transformed <a href="03798b.htm">Civitavecchia</a> into a military port. He strongly fortified the Castel of Sant' Angelo, Monte Cavallo, and built various fortifications on the right side of the Tiber in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He erected the beautifully situated <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> villa at Castle Gandolfo, founded the Vatican Seminary, built various churches and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, beautified streets, piazzas, and fountains. The three bees in his escutcheon attract the attention of every observant visitor in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the <a href="13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a> he erected the baldachin over the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a>, the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Countess Matilda, translating her remains from <a href="09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, and his own <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a>, opposite that of <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. For some of these structures he used bronze from the roof of the Pantheon, thus causing the well-known but unwarranted pasquinade: "Quod non fecerunt Barbari, fecerunt Barberini."</p>

<p>The pontificate of Urban extended over one of the most critical periods in the history of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>. Ranke and Gregorovius attribute Urban's actions in this <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> to his intention to humiliate the two Houses of Habsburg (Austria and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>), whose too great power was a constant menace to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; hence, they declare, he favoured <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and did not subsidize Emperor Ferdinand II in his <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against Gustavus Adolphus and the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. An unbiased study of the situation will lead to a different conclusion. Neither as pontiff not as temporal ruler could Urban remain a disinterested onlooker, and he had no other motive than the welfare of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. As the common Father of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> he interposed concerning the Valtellina, a strategically important valley between <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> and the Grisons, which was eagerly coveted by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> as well as <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He refused to join the alliance which <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> had made with <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> against <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1624, and was instrumental in bringing about the Treaty of Monzon, 5 March, 1626, which gave equal <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> upon the Valtellina to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He also refused to enter the league which <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> had concluded with <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> at the beginning of the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of the Mantuan succession in 1629. "It is impossible for me," he writes to Nagni, the French <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, 2 April, 1629, "to put in jeopardy the common fatherhood and, in consequence, to be no longer able to heal and pacify, which is the proper business of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as vicar of Christ" (Nunziatura di Francia, Vat. Lib. Cod. 71, and Nicoletti, III, 1451-58).</p>

<p>Equally <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> are the accusations of Ranke and Gregorovius that Urban opposed the election of Ferdinand's oldest son as King of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and advocated the dismissal of Wallenstein as commander-in-chief of the imperial army through his <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at the Electoral Diet of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1630. The first accusation was already branded as a <a href="03190c.htm">calumny</a> by Cardinal Francesco Barberini in a conference with the imperial ambassador Savelli on 16 March, 1629 (Nunziatura di Germania, Cod. 118, fol. 89); the second is refuted by Urban himself, who on 17 January, 1632, congratulated Wallenstein on his reassumption of the command and sent him the <a href="02602a.htm">Apostolic blessing</a> (Registrum brevium, XXXI, 87). It is, however, <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that Urban did not subsidize the imperial army and the Catholic League as liberally as he could and should have done. Nevertheless, he sent (1632-34) two million francs out of his own means to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> troops in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Urban did not join the League of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Estates, which was planned by the emperor, as the League was directed not only against Gustavus Adolphus, but also against <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; hence it could not be joined by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as the common father of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. He urged Louis XIII and <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> to desist from subsidizing the King of Sweden, but refused to <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> them, as he feared a repetition of what had occurred in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> under <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> and Elizabeth (Nunziatura di Germania, Cod. 127, fol. 266).</p>

<p>The greatest <a href="03190c.htm">calumny</a> that has been spread about Urban is his alleged sympathy with Gustavus Adolphus, whose death he is said to have mourned and for whose <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> he is said to have celebrated a Requiem Mass. What Urban thought of the <a href="14347a.htm">Swedish</a> king and how he mourned his death is manifest from a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>, addressed to Ferdinand on 14 December, 1632, when the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> received the news that Gustavus Adolphus had fallen in battle (16 November, 1632). The <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> is published in the original Latin by Ehses. The following quotation will suffice: "We give eternal thanks to the Lord of vengeance because he rendered retribution to the proud and shook from the neck of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> their most bitter enemy." The Mass which he is said to have celebrated in the German National Church, the Anima, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 11 December, was in reality a Mass of thanksgiving, of which Alaleone, the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> master of ceremonies, says expressly: "This <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated in thanksgiving upon receiving the message of the death of the King of Sweden" (Cod. Vat. 9252, II, 71 sq.). On the next day the "Te Deum" was sung in the Sistine Chapel in presence of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, "ob laetitiam necis regis Sueciae interfecti," after which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> himself chanted the versicles and orations.</p>

<p>It is as yet difficult to pass a correct judgment on Urban from every point of view. His life remains still to be written fairly. His private life was beyond all reproach, and the common welfare of the Church seems to have been the mainspring of his pontifical labours. His one fault was squandering money on his nephews, army, and fortifications, while stinting Ferdinand and the Catholic League in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>.</p>
