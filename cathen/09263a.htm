<p>(LEMOVICENSIS).</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the Departments of Haute Vienne and Creuse in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. After the <a href="04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, the See of Limoges lost twenty-four <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> from the district of Nontron which were annexed to the Diocese of P&eacute;rigueux, and forty-four from the district of Confolens, transferred to the Diocese of Angoul&ecirc;me; but until 1822 it included the entire ancient <a href="15086c.htm">Diocese of Tulle</a>, when the latter was reorganized.</p>

<p><a href="07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> names <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a>, who founded the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Limoges, as one of the seven <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> sent from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to Gaul in the middle of the third century. An anonymous life of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> (Vita primitiva), discovered and published by Abb&eacute; Arbellot, represents him as sent to Gaul by St. Peter. A great deal of controversy has arisen over the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of this biography. The discovery in the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> at Carlsruhe of a <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copy written at <a href="12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> by a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, Regimbertus, who died in 846, indubitably places the original before that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>. From the fact that it is in rhythmical prose, Mgr Bellet thinks it belongs to the seventh century. Pere de Smedt and Mgr Duchesne question this conclusion and maintain that the "Vita primitiva" is much later than <a href="07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>. M. de Lasteyrie gives 800 as the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of its origin. In addition to the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> already cited, the Abbey of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> at the beginning of the eleventh century possessed a circumstantial life of its <a href="11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, according to which, and to the cycle of later legends derived from it, <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> was one of the seventy-two disciples who witnessed the <a href="11527b.htm">Passion</a> and <a href="01767a.htm">Ascension</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, was present on the first Pentecost and at the martydom of St. Stephen. after which he followed St. Peter to Antioch and to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was sent to Gaul by the Prince of the Apostles, who assigned Austriclinium and Alpinian to accompany him. The three were welcomed at <a href="15086c.htm">Tulle</a> and turned away from Ahun. They set out towards Limoges, where, on the site of the present <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> erected a shrine in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Stephen. A <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, Aurelian, wished to throw <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, but was struck dead, then brought to life, <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and later <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>. Aurelian is the patron of the guild of butchers in Limoges. Forty years after the <a href="01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> appeared to Martial, and announced to him the approach of death. The churches of Limoges celebrate this event on 16 June. After labouring for twenty-eight years as a missionary in <a href="06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> died at the age of fifty-nine, surrounded by his converts of Poitou, Berri, Auvergne, and Aquitaine.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The writer of this "Life" pretends to be Aurelian, <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial's</a> disciple and successor in the See of Limoges. Mgr Duchesne thinks it not unlikely that the real authorship of this "apocryphal and lying" work should be attributed to the chronicler Adh&eacute;mar de Chabannes, noted for his fabrications; but M. de Lasteyrie is of opinion that it was written ahout 955, before the birth of Adh&eacute;mar. Be that as it may, this "Vita Aureliana" played an important part at the beginning of the eleventh century, when the Abbot Hugh (1019-1025) brought before several councils the question of the Apostolic date of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial's</a> mission. Before the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period there is no trace of the story that <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> was sent to Gaul by St. Peter. It did not spread until the eleventh century and was revived in the seventeenth by the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Bonaventure de Saint-Amable, in his voluminous "Histoire de <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a>". Mgr Duchesne and M. de Lasteyrie assert that it cannot be maintained against the direct testimony of <a href="07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, who places the origin of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Limoges about the year 250. The most distinguished <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Limoges are: St. Roricius (d. 507), who built the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Augustine at Limoges; St. Roricius II (d. about 553), who built the church of St-Pierre-du-Queyroix and the Basilica of St. Junianus at Limoges; St. Ferr&eacute;ol (d. 597), the friend of St. Yrieix; St. Lupus, or Loup (613-629); St. Sacerdos (Sardon), <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Calabrum, afterwards <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; St. Cessa (740-761), who led the people of Limoges against the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> under <a href="03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>; Cardinal Jean du Bellay (1541-1545). The ecelesiastics who served the <a href="04558a.htm">crypt</a> of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> organized themselves into a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 848, and built a <a href="02781a.htm">church</a> beside that of St.-Pierre-du-S&eacute;pulchre which overhung the <a href="04558a.htm">crypt</a>. This new church, which they called St-Sauveur, was demolished in 1021, and was replaced in 1028 by a larger edifice in Auvergnat style. <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a> came in person to reconsecrate it in 1095. In the thirteenth century the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Benedict arose beside the old church of St-Pierre-du-S&eacute;pulchre. It was also called the church of the Grand Confraternity of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a>. The different organizations which were grouped around it, anticipated and solved many important <a href="14115a.htm">sociological</a> questions.</p>

<p>Limoges, in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, comprised two towns: one called the "City", the other the "Chateau" or "Castle". The government of the "Castle" belonged at first to the Abbots of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> who claimed to have received it from Louis the Pious. Later, the viscounts of Limoges claimed this authority, and constant friction existed until the beginning of the thirteenth century, when, owing to the new communal activity, consuls were appointed, to whose authority the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> were forced to submit (1212). After two intervals during which the English kings imposed their rule, Charles V in 1371 united the "Castle" with the royal demesne, and thus ended the political rule of the Abbey of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a>. Until the end of the old regime, however, the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> exercised direct <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the Combes quarter of the city. In 1534, Abbot Matthieu Jouviond, finding that the monastic spirit had almost totally died out in the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, thought best to change it into a collegiate church, and in 1535 the king and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> gave their consent. It was suppressed in 1791, and early in the nineteenth century even the buildings had disappeared. In the thirteenth century, the Abbey of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a>, possessed the finest <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> (450 volumes) in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> after that of Cluny (570 volumes). Some have been lost, but 200 of them were bought by Louis XV in 1730, and today are one of the most valuable collections in the Bibliotheque Nationale at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Most of these <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, ornamented with beautiful miniatures, were written in the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> itself. M. Emile Molinier and M. Rupin admit a relation between these miniatures of <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> and the earliest Limoges enamels, but M. de Lasteyrie disputes this theory. The <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> settled at Limoges in 1223. According to the chronicle of Pierre Coral, <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Martin of Limoges, <a href="01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> established a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> there in 1226 and departed in the first months of 1227. On the night of <a href="10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, it is said, he was preaching in the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Pierre du Queyroix, when he stopped for a moment and remained silent. At the same instant he appeared in the choir of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and read a lesson. It was doubtless at Ch&acirc;teauneuf in the territory of Limoges that took place the celebrated apparition of the Infant Jesus to St. Anthony.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The diocese specially honours the following: St. Sylvanus, a native of Ahun, martyr; St. Adorator, disciple of <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at Lupersac; St. Victorianus, an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a>; St. Vaast, a native of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> who became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01752c.htm">Arras</a> and <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a> (fifth-sixth century); St. Psal modius, a native of Britain, died a <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> at Eymoutiers; St. Yrieix, d. in 591, chancellor to Theodebert King of Austrasia, and founder of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Attanum (the town of St. Yrieix is named after him); St. Etienne de Muret (1046-1126), who together with Guillaume d'Uriel, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Limoges, founded the famous <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="06725c.htm">Grandmont</a>. Mention must also be made of the following who were natives of Limoges: Bernard Guidonis (1261-1313), born at La Roche d'Abeille, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lodeve and a celebrated canonist; the Aubusson <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, one of whom, Pierre d'Aubusson (1483-1503), was Grand Master of the <a href="07477a.htm">Order of Jerusalem</a>, and one of the defenders of <a href="13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>; Marc Antoine* Muret, called the "Orator of the Popes" (1526-1596). Three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> came from the Diocese of Limoges: Pierre Roger, born at Maulinont, elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1342 as <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, died in 1352; Etienne Albert, or d'Albret, born near Pompadour, elevated to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> in 1352 as <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>, died in 1362; Pierre Roger de Beau-fort, nephew of <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, also born at Maulmont. As <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> he reigned from 1371 till 1378. <a href="06795b.htm">Maurice Bourdin</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12338a.htm">Prague</a>, <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> for a brief space in 1118, under the name of <a href="06795b.htm">Gregory VIII</a>, also belonged to this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. <a href="11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> came to Limoges in 1062 as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, to compel the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> to accept the supremacy of the Order of Cluny.</p>

<p>The Council of Limoges, held in 1031, is noted not only for its decision with regard to <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial's</a> mission, but because, at the instigation of Abbot Odolric, it proclaimed the <a href="15068a.htm">"Truce of God"</a> and threatened with general <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> those <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords who would not swear to maintain it.
