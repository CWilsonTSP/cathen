<p>Situated on the Shannon, about half way between Athlone and Banagher, King's County, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and the most remarkable of the ancient <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of Erin. Its founder was St. Ciaran, surnamed Mac an Tsair, or "Son of the Carpenter", and thus distinguished from his namesake, the <a href="11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of <a href="11342b.htm">Ossory</a>. He chose this rather uninviting region because he thought it a more suitable dwelling-place for disciples of the Cross than the luxuriant plains not far away. Ciaran was born at Fuerty, County Roscommon, in 512, and in his early years was committed to the care of a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> named Justus, who had <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> him, and from whose hands he passed to the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Finnian at <a href="04064a.htm">Clonard</a>. Here he met all those saintly youths who with himself were afterwards known as the "Twelve Apostles of Erin", and he quickly won their esteem. When Finnian had to absent himself from the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, it was to the youthful Ciaran that he deputed his authority to teach and "give out the prayers", and when Ciaran announced his intended departure, Finnian would fain resign to him his <em>cathair</em>, or chair, and keep him in Clonard. But Ciaran felt himself unripe for such responsibility, and he <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a>, moreover, he had work to do elsewhere.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>After leaving Clonard, Ciaran, like most of the contemporary <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, went to Aran to commune with holy Enda. One night the two <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> beheld the same vision, "of a great fruitful tree, beside a stream, in the middle of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and it protected the island of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and its fruit went forth over the sea that surrounded the island, and the birds of the world came to carry off somewhat of its fruit". And when Ciaran spoke of the vision to Enda, the latter said to him:</p>

<blockquote><p>The great tree which thou beholdest is thou thyself, for thou art great in the eyes of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>, and all <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> will be full of thy <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>. This island will be protected under the shadow of thy favour, and multitudes will be satisfied with the grace of thy <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Go then, with <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> word, to a bank of a stream, and there found a church. </p></blockquote>

<p>Ciaran obeyed. On reaching the mainland he first paid a visit to <a href="13713a.htm">St. Senan of Scattery</a> and then proceeded towards the "middle of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>", founding on his way two <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, in one of which, on Inis Ainghin, he spent over three years. Going farther south he came to a lonely waste by the Shannon, and seeking out a beautiful grassy ridge, called Ard Tiprait, or the "Height of the Spring," he said to his companions: "Here then we will stay, for many <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> will go to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> hence, and there will be a visit from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and from men forever on this place". Thus, on 23 January, 544, Ciaran laid the foundation of his <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of Clonmacnoise, and on 9 May following he witnessed its completion. Diarmait, son of Cerball, afterwards High King of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, aided and encouraged the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> in every way, promising him large grants of land as an endowment. Ciaran's government of his <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was of short duration; he was seized by a plague which had already decimated the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and died 9 September, 544.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that a young saint dying before he was thirty-three, should have been the founder of a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> whose fame was to endure for centuries. But Ciaran was a man of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> and labour, trained in all the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> and discipline of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> and full of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and so was a worthy instrument in the hands of Providence for the carrying out of a high design. St. Cummian of <a href="04064b.htm">Clonfert</a> calls him one of the <em>Patres Priores</em> of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church, and <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, the most illustrious <em>alumnus</em> of Clonmacnoise, proclaims him the <em>Gloria Gentis Scotorum</em>. His festival is kept on 9 September, and his shrine is visited by many <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>.</p>

<p>Ciaran left but little mark upon the literary annals of the famous <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> he founded. But in the character which he gave it of a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for a whole nation, and not for a particular tribe or district, is to be found the secret of its success. The masters were chosen simply for their learning and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>; the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> were elected almost in rotation from the different provinces; and the pupils thronged thither from all parts of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, as well as from the remote quarters of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. From the beginning it enjoyed the confidence of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the favour of kings and princes who were <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> to be buried in its shadow. In its sacred clay sleep Diarmait the High King, and his rival Guaire, King of Connaught; Turlough O'Conor, and his hapless son, Roderick, the last King of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and many other royal benefactors, who believed that the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Ciaran would bring to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> all those who were buried there.</p>

<p>But Clonmacnoise was not without its vicissitudes. Towards the close of the seventh century a plague carried off a large number of its students and professors; and in the eighth century the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was burned three times, probably by accident, for the buildings were mainly of wood. During the ninth and tenth centuries it was harassed not only by the Danes, but also, and perhaps mainly, by some of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> chieftains. One of these, Felim MacCriffon, sacked the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> three times, on the last occasion slaughtering the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, we are told, like sheep. Even the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> themselves were infected by the bellicose spirit of the times, which manifested itself not merely in defensive, but some- times even in offensive <a href="15546c.htm">warfare</a>. These were <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> days for Clonmacnoise, but with the blessing of Ciaran, and under the "shadow of his favour", it rose superior to its trials, and all the while was the <a href="01326c.htm">Alma</a> Mater of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and sages.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Under date 794, is recorded the death of <a href="04092a.htm">Colgu the Wise</a>, poet, <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and historian, who is said to have been the teacher of <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> at Clonmacnoise. Another <em>alumnus</em> of vast erudition, whose gravestone may still be seen there, was Suibhne, son of Maclume, who died in 891. He is described as the "wisest and greatest Doctor of the Scots", and the annals of Ulster call him a "most excellent scribe". <a href="06655a.htm">Tighernach</a>, the most accurate and most ancient prose chronicler of the northern nations, belongs to Clonmacnoise, and probably also <a href="04778c.htm">Dicuil</a> (q.v), the world-famed geographer. In this <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> were composed the "Chronicon Scotorum", a valuable chronicle of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> affairs from the earliest times to 1135, and the "Leabhar na h-Uidhre", which, excepting the "Book of Armagh", is the oldest <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> historical transcript now in existence. In the twelfth century Clonmacnoise was a great <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of Celtic art, architecture, <a href="13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, and metal work. To this period and to this <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> we owe the stone crosses of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a> and Cong, the processional cross of Cong, and perhaps the Tara Brooch and the Chalice of <a href="01699c.htm">Ardagh</a>. The ruined towers and crosses and <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> are still to be seen; but there is no trace of the little church of Ciaran which was the nucleus of Clonmacnoise.</p>
