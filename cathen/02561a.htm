<p>According to the strict meaning, the word should signify the marrying of a second after the death of the first wife, in contradistinction to <a href="02564a.htm">polygamy</a>, which is having two simultaneous wives. The present usage in criminal law of applying the term <em>bigamy</em> to that which is more strictly called <a href="02564a.htm">polygamy</a> is, according to Blackstone (Lib. IV, n. 163), a corruption of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of bigamy.</p>

<p>Canonically viewed, bigamy denotes (a) the condition of a man married to two real or interpretative wives in succession, and as a consequence (b) his unfitness to receive, or exercise after reception, <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, minor and <a href="11279a.htm">sacred orders</a>. This unfitness gives rise to an irregularity which is an impediment impedient and not diriment, hence orders conferred in violation of it are valid but illicit. This irregularity is not a punishment, medicinal nor punitive, as there is no <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> nor fault of any kind in a man marrying a second wife after the death of his first, or a third after the death of his second; it is a bar against his receiving or exercising any <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order or dignity.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Origin</h2>

<p>This irregularity is not affixed to bigamy by either the natural or Mosaic law. It has its <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> origin in the apostolic injunction of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>: "It behoveth, therefore, a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be blameless, the husband of one wife" (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs2">1 Timothy 3:2</a>); "Let <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> be the husbands of one wife" (loc. cit., 12) and, ". . . the husband of one wife" (<a href="../bible/tit001.htm#vrs6">Titus 1:6</a>). By these words the Apostle does not enjoin marriage on <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> [Sts. Paul, Titus, and Timothy were <a href="03481a.htm">celibates</a> as were, according to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> ("Monogamy", iv, in "Ante Nicene Fathers", Amer. Edit.) all the Apostles with exception of St. Peter], but he forbids bigamists to be admitted to Sacred orders. Owing to the small number of those who practiced <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> at the coming of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Apostles found it impossible to supply <a href="03481a.htm">celibates</a> for <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> and were forced to admit married men to Sacred orders. Blamelessness of life, however, was required, and since iteration of marriage was considered by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and the people as a strong presumption of incontinency it was decreed that should the bishop-elect (priest- or deacon-elect) be a married man, he must have had only one wife, and further, that after his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> he should live apart from her. <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (H&aelig;r. lxiv, 4) and <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Epist. Contra Vigilantium, 1) assert that such was the general custom of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This practice of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> before or after <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> was universal in all the Churches of the East as well as of the West until about the year A.D. 700 when in the Synod of Trullo concession was made to Greek <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to cohabit with the wives they had married before <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>. They were forbidden, however, to marry again under penalty of absolute deposition from the ministry. In the Pauline injunction no mention is made of <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> or <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> in <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, for the simple reason that those orders were not then instituted. The <a href="03279a.htm">Apostolic Canons</a> (fourth century), which extended the Pauline prohibition to all grades of the sacrament of orders, were not universally observed. Vestiges of a lax discipline on this point are to be met with in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (Council of Orange, c. xxv) and in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Counc. of Toledo, cc. iii and iv). The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on the contrary, strictly followed the Apostolic canons. This is evident from the decrees of the <a href="12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiffs</a> <a href="08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> (401-417), Hilary (461-469), <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> (590-604), <a href="03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> (1191-98), and <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216). <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (1227-41) and <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> (1271-76) further decreed that bigamists should be deprived of every <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> privilege and the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to wear the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> garb and <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a> under penalty of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> finally forbade bigamists to exercise functions attached to <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, even though these functions were, on account of the necessity of the times, allowed to be performed by <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> (Sess. XXIII, c. xvii, de Reform.).</p>

<p>The reason for the existence of this irregularity is twofold: moral and mystical. The moral reason, which was that of the Orientals and some <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, is the presumed incontinency on the part of the bigamist and his consequent unfitness to discharge efficiently the office of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> among a people who looked with great suspicion upon a bigamist and held him in little or no esteem. The mystical reason, which was and is the primary reason of the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a> (it admits the moral reason, but as secondary to the mystical) is the defect in the perfect resemblance of the second marriage to the great type of <a href="09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a> &#151; the mystical union of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This union is the union of one husband (<a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>) with one spouse (the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>) without spot or blemish. Second marriages destroy the unity of one husband with one virgin wife, and cause a dividing of one flesh with two bodies, instead of cementing the union of two bodies in one, according to Genesis, ii, 24, "They shall be two [one husband, one wife] in one flesh". This division of one body with two, instead of union with one body, is the bed-rock of this irregularity. This defect in the perfect resemblance of the second marriage (real or interpretative) to the great type of marriage gives rise to the irregularity, and to the name by which it is known, "ex defectu sacramenti". It is not proper that one who has received a sacrament defective in its resemblance to its exemplar should become a dispenser of <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to others.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Division</h2>

<p>In the first centuries there was only one kind of bigamy called <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, or real, or proper. A second kind, called interpretative or fictitious, was afterwards added. In the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a third kind, called <em>similar</em>, was introduced by the scholastics (<a href="04768b.htm">Devoti</a>, can. univ., II, p. 206). Durandus was the first to use the term <em>similitudinaria</em> (Specul., pars. I, de dispens. Juxta. n. 6). Since then the traditional division has been and is threefold, viz. real, interpretative, and similar. Many canonists of this century and last hold that similar bigamy should not be included under the irregularity <em>ex bigamia</em>. Another division is made, but there is no unanimity concerning it, i.e. bigamy <em>ex defectu sacramenti</em> (by reason of defective sacrament) and bigamy <em>ex delicto</em> (by reason of guilt). D'Annibale (Summul. Theol., Pars. 1, n. 417 and 418, note 11 fourth edit.) holds that similar bigamists and not a few interpretative bigamists are irregular <em>ex delicto</em>, and not <em>ex defectu sacramenti</em>. <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a> (lib. VII, de Irregul., n. 436) and very many others, as well as the <a href="14389a.htm">National Synods</a> of the Syrians (an. 1888, p. 173, edit. 1899) and of the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> (Cairo, an. 1898, p. 142), class all three kinds of bigamists as irregular <em>ex defectu sacramenti.</em> Bigamy in general is the state of a man who has really or interpretatively contracted and consummated two valid or two invalid <a href="09707a.htm">marriages</a>, or one valid and the other invalid, or one real, and the other a spiritual, marriage. Two things are essential to every kind of bigamy: (1) a marriage valid or invalid-adulterous connections or <a href="04207a.htm">concubinage</a> do not enter into the question at all; (2) a carnal <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by which the parties legally married become one flesh, and without which there is neither bigamy nor irregularity.</p>

<p><em>Real bigamy</em> demands two valid and legal and consummated marriages with virgins; therefore, two real wives one after the other. It is indifferent whether or not the marriages took place before or after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or one before and the other after; the second successive marriage imperfectly symbolizes "the great Sacrament of Christ in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#vrs32">Ephesians 5:32</a>), and the irregularity is present (<a href="08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a>, Decret., can. 13, dist. 34). There is, therefore, no real bigamy (a) if either or both marriages are invalid, (b) if either or both have not been consummated, (c) if either or both <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> have not been virgins, (d) if one of the two ceremonies was a valid, consummated marriage, and the other a mere <a href="02537c.htm">betrothal</a> followed by carnal union.</p>

<p><em>Interpretative bigamy</em> is the state of a man who has not as a matter of fact had two legal wives in succession, but whose matrimonial ventures--whether one or two--are accompanied with such circumstances as to warrant the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> by a legal fiction to hold him as a bigamist and irregular. It is to be remembered that the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> which govern fictitious (similar and interpretative) bigamy must be strictly construed, for two reasons: (1) because there is question of an irregularity--something odious; and (2) it is a fiction of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and therefore does not hold unless in those cases expressly mentioned in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> (<a href="05751c.htm">Fagnanus</a>, cap. In Pr&aelig;sen., n. 23, de Probat.). <a href="02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a> wisely remarks (Ad addendum, 15 February, 1753, par. 15), "It is the sole right of the legislator, and beyond the power of any private author or doctor, to draw legal conclusion from a fiction of law. Many, therefore, of the ablest canonists of recent years (v.g. D'Annibale, Gaspari, Icard, Wernz, Lombardi, <a href="16006b.htm">Ballerini</a>-Palmieri), as also the <a href="14389a.htm">national synods</a> of the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> and Syrians, restrict real and interpretative bigamies to the case where a man marries either two valid and legal wives, or a <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a>, or a corrupt <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>, or knows his wife carnally after she has been corrupted by a third party. <br></p>

<p>Interpretative bigamy is threefold:--</p>

<p>(1) When a man contracts and consummates only one, and that a valid marriage, or weds one wife to whom he is united in one flesh, yet the circumstances are such that the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> considers two marriages and two wives. Of this class there are three cases: (a) When a single man marries a <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> already made one flesh with a former husband (Decretal Greg., Lib. I, Tit. xxi, Cap. iii). Here the <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> has had two husbands and has divided her flesh with two instead of being cemented to only one. Her marriage to the second husband is defective in its resemblance to the marriage symbol--union of Christ with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; the second husband is not the only husband of the one wife who herself should have been the wife of only one husband. As the wife in this case has had two real husbands, so, by fiction of law, her husband is considered to have had two interpretative wives. (b) When he marries an unmarried <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>, already by a third party corrupted (Pope Hilary, Synod. Rom. Cap. ii, Dist. XXXIV, c. ix, Decret.). Here again is a division of flesh with two instead of union with one, and hence the defect, and, as a consequence, the irregularity. (c) When he carnally knows his own wife after she has committed <a href="01163a.htm">adultery</a> or has been forcibly oppressed (Decretum, c. xi; c. xii). The husband in this case is not barred from orders unless the <a href="01163a.htm">adultery</a> of the wife whom he as a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> has married was conclusively <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>; nevertheless, in this case, as in cases (a) and (b), <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> on the part of the husband (sc. of the <a href="15617c.htm">widowhood</a> or corruption or <a href="01163a.htm">adultery</a> or rape of his wife) would not except him from bigamy and irregularity, since there is here question of an irregularity <em>ex defectu sacramenti</em> and not <em>ex delicto</em>. The defect is present irrespective of his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>(2) When he marries once, but the marriage is invalid. (a) The one in Sacred orders who marries a widow-marriage invalid on account of diriment impediment of S. Orders-and is carnally joined to her, is an interpretative bigamist and irregular (Cap. VII, Tit. XXI, De. Big.). <a href="08013a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> (loc. cit.) says that although this cleric is not a real bigamist, yet with him, as with a real bigamist, it was not lawful to dispense as the husband of a <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a>, not because of the defect in the sacrament, but on account of the marital intention joined with carnal union. Although not expressed in the above canon, yet it is the common opinion that the cleric in major order who marries a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> corrupted by a third party is a bigamist and irregular. He would not be irregular if We married a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> seduced by himself and known by no other man (Schmalz., Tit. XXI, De Bigam., n. 6). Civil marriage will suffice in this case, even where the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> law is published (S. U. I., December 22, 1880). (b) Invalid by reason of a preexisting marriage bond (<em>ligamen</em>), as, for instance, where the man marries a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> who has been <a href="05054c.htm">divorced</a>, repudiated, or rejected by a former husband, or who has <a href="05054c.htm">divorced</a> or left him. In this case the marriage is defective, the <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> having shared her body with two, and hence he who married her is irregular for the above-mentioned reason (Lib. 1, Tit. XXI, C. I; Dist. XXXIV, Can. xv). (c) If the marriage was invalid by reason of a diriment impediment other than order and <em>ligamen</em>, the more prominent opinion holds that the irregularity is incurred. Fagnanus (Comment., Cap. iv, De Big., n. 45) asserts that the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="13205c.htm">Rota</a>, to whom the case was specially referred by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, decided that a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a> in <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a> who contracted and consummated an invalid marriage with a <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> was an interpretative bigamist and irregular and stood in need of <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, and that Pope Urban, upon the strength of that decision, granted <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. Many of the best canonists of today (e.g. D'Annibale and Gaspari) hold the contrary. The case is not expressed in law, they say, and is a legal fiction which at all times is dangerous and is totally unwarranted if the two cases differ in every respect, as do these--the one being in major, and the other in <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a>; the one in bad <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and the other in <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a>. Yet, after all is said <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>, it still remains <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that the proximate cause of the irregularity in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> cited is identical with that of the second case, to wit, marital intent with carnal consummation.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>(3) When a man marries twice and either or both marriages are invalid, as (a) he who having contracted.<br> and consummated a marriage with a virgin, upon her death received Sacred orders, and afterwards,<br> without any deception on his part, contracts and consummates a sacrilegious and invalid marriage with a virgin or <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a>, becomes an interpretative a virgin and irregular, not because of any defect in the sacrament in the second marriage, which is no marriage and no sacrament, but because of the marital intent followed by consummation by means of which the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> division of his body with two has been effected (<a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, cap. iii, iv, De Big.). Should the cleric feign, rather than honestly intend, the second marriage, in order to accomplish the carnal union, some are of the opinion that he does not incur the irregularity, the marital intent required by the <a href="08013a.htm">Innocentian</a> law not being verified; others more commonly affirm that irregularity is contracted. The reason given by the affirmants is that the <a href="08013a.htm">Innocentian</a> marital intent is not so much the intention to contract a valid marriage, as to externally contract and consummate, an intention that is always presumed to be present in such cases. External marriages are always supposed to be free and <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. Simulation is never presumed, but must, on the contrary, be demonstrated. (b) Should the first marriage before receiving Sacred orders be invalid on account of any diriment impediment (ve.g., <a href="04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> or the like), although the case is not expressly stated in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, the general opinion, with a few exceptions, is that he is an interpretative bigamist and irregular. In answer to their opponents, the affirmants say that the marriage mentioned (Cap. iv, De Big.) may have been invalid, as there is no <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> that it was valid, in which case the argument from one species to another would be legitimate. (c) Should both marriages be invalid, some assert there is no interpretative bigamy or irregularity. Certainly there is no law for it. Others, as St. Alphonsus (Vol. VII, n. 455; Francisco Su&aacute;rez., Disp. XLIX, Sect. II, n. 11) teach as the most common and notable opinion that there is present the marital intent with the carnal consummation which alone suffices to induce the irregularity. Canonists differ in opinion as to the case where two invalid marriages were contracted and consummated in <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a>. The most common and probable opinion is that irregularity is contracted, for the reason that it is not the guilt of the desire, but the intention to contract and consummate the two marriages which is the reason of the irregularity as laid down by <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (Cap. 4, De Big). By almost common consent the irregularity is said to be contracted by the cleric <a href="14779a.htm">tonsured</a> or in <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a> or <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> who, after having contracted and consummated a marriage invalid on account of a known impediment and afterwards, whether his wife be living or dead, contracts and consummates another marriage even with a virgin. There is present in the case a division of flesh and the marital intent <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to produce irregularity.</p>

<p><em>Similar Bigamy</em> is nowhere clearly and expressly stated in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. It owes its existence to the almost universal and constant teaching of canonists and <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> since the time of Durandus. Similar bigamy is twofold: (1) When a religious who has been solemnly professed in a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order approved by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> marries a virgin and carnally knows her as such. (2) When a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a> in Sacred orders, in violation of the <a href="03481a.htm">law of celibacy</a>, contracts and consummates a marriage with a virgin. This form of bigamy presupposes only one carnal marriage and a spiritual marriage, which are interpretatively considered two <a href="09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and each putative husband is considered<br> to have two interpretative wives. The carnal marriages are invalid by reason of the diriment impediment of solemn <a href="12451b.htm">religious profession</a> and of orders respectively; but because of the marital intent followed by carnal consummation, some claim that similar bigamy and irregularity are incurred by reason of the defective signification of the sacrilegious marriage to the symbol of matrimony; some admit that there is no bigamy, but an irregularity arising from the sacrilegious marriage; others again insist that there is an irregularity on account of some kind of a defect in the sacrament, but there is no law declaring it to be bigamous and irregular. Gaspari (De Sacra Ordin., nn. 393 sqq.) and others reject the first opinion altogether and very conclusively show that the canons of <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> and the canons of Gratian upon which the first opinion is grounded are not to the point. Gaspari shows that the decrees (Decretales--Lib. IV, Tit. 6, Cap. i, 2 and 4) of <a href="01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a> do not refer to bigamy or irregularity, but speak of <a href="14345b.htm">suspensions</a> and <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; that the Gratian canons treat of religious men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> who have broken their <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> and are to be removed from their grade, and subjected to the same penances as were at that period imposed upon bigamists. <a href="04012c.htm">Pope Clement</a>, in his <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> (Lib. 4, Tit. Unicus de Cons. et aff. Clem.) also speaks of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and not irregularity. The constitution of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, <a href="01645a.htm">"Apostolicae Sedis"</a> imposes upon similar bigamists <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> reserved to the ordinaries, and nothing more. It is evident, therefore, that the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> affixes no note of irregularity to a so-called similar bigamist. Practically speaking, however, there is little difference, as the so-called similar bigamists are prevented, on account of the censure and the <a href="08001a.htm">infamy</a> of their act, from receiving higher orders or exercising those already received; and should they solemnly exercise the functions of their grade, they would become irregular on account of the violated censure. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> can, when they have put away the <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>, done penance, and led edifying lives, absolve them from the censure and dispense them from any irregularity, if any has been incurred, and promote them to higher orders. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that religious, not in Sacred orders, with simple <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, who contract and consummate marriage with a virgin or with a renegade <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a> who has broken her solemn <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, is neither a bigamist nor irregular. No such case is found in the canon.</p>

<h2>Effects</h2>

<p>Bigamy begets irregularity, the principal effect of which is to entirely exclude from the reception and use and exercise of any <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order and <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> attached to any order. <a href="06798a.htm">Pope Gregory X</a> (Lib. 1, Tit. XII, Cap. Unic. in Sexto) further declared that bigamists should be stripped of every <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> privilege, removed from the protection of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, and subjected to civil, <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, deprived of the canon safeguarding their <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> from personal attack, and forbidden to wear the <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> garb, under penalty of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to be incurred at the moment of their attempted marriage. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> also forbids to bigamists the exercise of any office or function of <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, even of such functions as are usually, by permission, allowed to married <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> on account of scarcity of <a href="03481a.htm">celibate</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> (Sess. XXIII, C. 17, De Reform). Clerics in <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a> whose marriages were invalid are not comprehended under the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> law. Clerics in Sacred orders and religious <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, who, by virtue of the <a href="03481a.htm">law of celibacy</a> and <a href="12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, are spiritually wedded to the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> and religious states respectively, are not comprehended under the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> stripping them of every <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> privilege, and the use of <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> garb, and this out of respect to their sacred character. Clerics on the other hand, in <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a> are not wedded to the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> state; hence they come under the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. Bishops who knowingly an without permission confer Sacred orders on a bigamist are by the Third <a href="01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (Dist . LV, Can. 2) suspended from saying <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> for one year, and by the <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a> law (Lib. 1, Tit. 21, Cap. ii) were deprived of the power of giving to others the orders they had conferred on a bigamist. Since the constitution <a href="01645a.htm">"Apostolicae Sedis"</a>, the only punishment is that which the Holy Father may deem fit to impose upon the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> violating the canons.</p>

<h2>Dispensation</h2>

<p>This irregularity is removed neither by <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> nor religious solemn profession, but by <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and he alone, can dispense with this prohibition to receive orders. He can dispense with a mere ecclesiastical law, such as is the Pauline injunction, although it is of Apostolic origin. <a href="09412b.htm">Pope Lucius III</a>, whilst urging the unlawfulness of granting a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> in face of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> prohibition, did, however, grant it to Nicholas de Tudeschis, a celebrated canonist, better known as Abbas Panormitanus (Glossa, ad verb. <em>Fiat</em>, C. Lector, XVIII, Dist. XXXIV). Dispensations in cases of one who marries two real wives or a <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> are exceedingly difficult to obtain (Lib. I, Tit. 9, De Renunt. Sec. Personae). Worthy of note is the fact that the <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> does not efface the defect in the sacrament, but the unfitness arising therefrom is removed. It is the universal opinion of today, whatever may have been the opinion of canonists in the past, that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> alone can dispense all bigamists, real and interpretative, as regards minor as well as Sacred orders, and the collation and use of the simple, as of great, <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>. The reason is evident: <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> cannot dispense in the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of their superiors, to wit, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or General Council. Some canonists claim that <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, by virtue of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, C. 6, De Ref), can dispense with interpretative bigamy arising from occult guilt. D'Annibale (loc. cit.) on this point well remarks that it is exceedingly difficult for such acts to be private. Sanchez asserts that it is of little moment whether or not the fact is private or <br> public, since the irregularity is not <em>ex delicto</em>, but <em>ex defectu Sacramenti</em>. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, where there is a grave and positive <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the existence of interpretative bigamy and its consequent irregularity, can grant <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. Bishops can dispense with all similar bigamists as above defined after they have left their putative wives, done penance, and led edifying lives, and can admit them to the exercise of all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions (Lib. IV, Tit. VI, Cap. i, Qui Clerici et Vov.; Lib. III, Tit. III, Cap. Sane 4). Regular <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, i.e. generals, <br> <a href="12514b.htm">provincials</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a>, guardians, having quasi-episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, cannot, in virtue of the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> and apart from special privileges, dispense their own subjects with real or <br> interpretative bigamy, even as regards minor as well as major orders. No such power has been given them by <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or general council. By virtue of privilege of <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (Constit. "Rom. Pont. Circumspecta", June 21, 1571, Sec. 3), joined with that of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, Cap. vi, etc.) power to dispense in irregularities on account of occult guilt, given to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, was extended to regular <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>. By virtue of the privilege of <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, regular <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> cannot dispense with real, interpretative, and public similar bigamists (P. Venantius, 0. F. M., Compend. Privil. Regularium, ed. 1906; Piat, Vol. II, p. 577, 2). As a matter of fact, the Sixtine constitution (Reg. Univ. Eccles., August 31, 1474) makes a special exception in the case of bigamy. The general opinion, that they cannot grant <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to their subjects who are real or interpretative bigamists, is evident from the fact that the <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a> law (C. Altercationis in 6&#186;) has reserved that faculty to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; second, <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> law is against such faculty; third, declaration of s. c. c. (3 January, 1589) has so decided; fourth, present practice of granting privileges and faculties to <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders as a rule makes an exception of bigamy, e.g., constit. of <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, 1826, "Plura Intra", directed to the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, withholds the faculty of dispensing with bigamists. If religious <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> do possess the faculty of dispensing in such cases, it must be by virtue of some special privilege of recent date. Bishops of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> subject to the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (these latter only <em>in</em> <em>foro interno</em>) have special faculties (Formula I, II, and IV respectively) to dispense interpretative bigamists; and in cases of paramount importance, on account of great scarcity of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> can dispense also with real bigamists. According to general opinion, the multiplication of marriages does not increase the number of irregularities contracted; so the bigamist and trigamist equally incur only one irregularity. In applications for <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> mention of only two out of the many marriages is sufficient, and that whether they are all real or interpretative or mixed bigamies. In the opinion, however, of those who divide interpretative bigamies into <em>ex defectu sacramenti</em> and <em>ex delicto</em> bigamies, it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in the case where a grave <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is the cause of the irregularity, to name both the irregularity <em>ex delicto</em> (with <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>) and the irregularity <em>ex defectu sacramenti</em> (without <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>).</p>
