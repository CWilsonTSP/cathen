<p>Guillaume de Grimoard, born at Grisac in Languedoc, 1310; died at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 19 December, 1370. Born of a knightly <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, he was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> and <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and became a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> at the little <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of Chirac near his home. A <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1363 informs us that he was <a href="12451b.htm">professed</a> at the great Abbey of St. Victor at <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, where he imbibed his characteristic <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for the Order of St. Benedict; even as <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> he wore its habit. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> at Chirac, and after a further course of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law at the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, Paris, and <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, he received the doctorate in 1342. He was one of the greatest canonists of his day; was professor of canon law at <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, and also taught at <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Paris, and <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; he acted successively as <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the Dioceses of <a href="04053a.htm">Clermont</a> and Uz&egrave;s, was at an unknown <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> (before 1342) affiliated to Cluny, became <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of Notre-Dame du Pr&eacute; (a <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> dependent on St. Germain d'Auxerre), and in 1352 was named <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of that famous house by <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>. With this date begins his diplomatic career. His first mission was to Giovanni Visconti, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and despot of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and this he carried out successfully; in 1354 and 1360 he was employed on the affairs of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; in 1361 he was appointed by <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> to the Abbacy of St. Victor at <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, but in 1362 was once more dispatched to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, this time on an embassy to Joanna of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>. It was while engaged on this business that the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> heard of his election to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> had died on 12 Sept. The choice of one who was not a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was due to jealousies within the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, which made the election of any one of its members almost impossible. Guillaume de Grimoard was chosen for his virtue and learning, and for his skill in practical affairs of government and diplomacy. He arrived at <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> on 28 Oct., entered <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> three days later, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 6 November, taking the name of Urban because, as he said, "all the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> who had borne the name had been <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>". The general satisfaction which this election aroused was voiced by <a href="11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, who wrote to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, "It is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone who has chosen you".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On 20 November King John of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> visited <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; his main purpose was to obtain the hand of Joanna of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, ward of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, for his son Philip, Duke of Touraine. In a letter of 7 November Urban had already approved her project of marriage with King James of Majorca, a king without a kingdom; by so doing the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> safeguarded his own independence at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, which would have been gravely imperilled had the marriage of Joanna, who was also Countess of Provence, united to the Crown of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the country surrounding the little <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> principality. The letter written by Urban to Joanna on 29 Nov., urging the marriage with Philip, was probably meant rather to appease the French king than to persuade the recipient. The <a href="02537c.htm">betrothal</a> of the Queen of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> to James of Majorca was signed on 14 Dec. The enormous ransom of 3,000,000 gold crowns, due to <a href="05321a.htm">Edward III of England</a> from John of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by the treaty of Bretigny, was still in great part unpaid, and John now sought permission to levy a <a href="14741b.htm">tithe</a> on the revenues of the French <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Urban refused this request as well as another for the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of four <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> chosen by the king. John also desired to intervene between the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and Barnab&ograve; Visconti, tyrant of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>. He was again refused, and when Barnab&ograve; failed to appear within the three months allowed by his citation, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him (3 March, 1363). In April of the same year Visconti was defeated before Bologna. Peace was concluded in March, 1364; Barnab&ograve; restored the castles seized by him, while Urban withdrew the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and undertook to pay half a million gold florins.</p>

<p>The <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was a lover of peace, and much of his diplomacy was directed to the pacification of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Both countries were overrun by mercenary bands known as the "Free Companies", and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> made many efforts to secure their dispersal or departure. His <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was disregarded and the companies refused to join the distant King of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in his battles with the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> although the Emperor Charles IV, who came to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in May, 1365, guaranteed the expenses of their journey and offered them the revenues of his kingdom of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> for three years. War now broke out between Pedro the Cruel of Navarre and his brother Henry of Trastamare. Pedro was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for his cruelties and persecutions of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and Bertrand Duguesclin, the victor of Cocherel, led the companies into <a href="10721a.htm">Navarre</a>; yet they visited <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> on their way and wrung blackmail from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> was quickly ended, and Urban returned to his former plan of employing the companies against the Turk. The Count of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> was to have led them to the assistance of the King of <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and the Eastern Empire, but this scheme too was a failure. Urban's efforts were equally fruitless in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where the whole land was overrun with bands led by such famous <em>condottieri</em> as the German Count of Landau and the Englishman Sir John Hawkwood. In 1365, after the failure of a scheme to unite Florence, <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and the Italian communes against them, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> commissioned Albornoz to persuade these companies to join the King of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. In 1366 he solemnly <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> them, forbade their employment, and called on the emperor and all the powers of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> to unite for their extirpation. All was in vain, for though a league of Italian cities was formed in September of that year, it was dissolved about fifteen months later owing to Florentine jealousy of the emperor.</p>

<p>Rome had suffered terribly through the absence of her pontiffs, and it became apparent to Urban that if he remained at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> the work of the warlike Cardinal Albornoz in restoring to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> would be undone. On 14 September, 1366, he informed the emperor of his determination to return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. All men rejoiced at the announcement except the French; the king understood that the departure from <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> would mean a diminution of French influence at the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>. The <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were in despair at the prospect of leaving <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and even threatened to <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. On 30 April, 1367, Urban left <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; on 19 May he sailed from <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and after a long coasting voyage he reached Corneto, where he was met by Albornoz. On 4 June the Romans brought the keys of Sant' Angelo in sign of welcome, and the Gesuati carrying their branches in their hands and headed by their founder, <a href="08458a.htm">Blessed John Colombini</a>, preceded the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Five days later he entered <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, where he dwelt in the citadel. The disturbed state of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> made it impossible for Urban to set out to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> until he had gathered a considerable army, so it was not till 16 Oct. that he entered the city at the head of an imposing cavalcade, under the escort of the Count of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, the Marquess of <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and other princes.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The return of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> appeared to the contemporary world both as a great event and as a religious action. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> now set to work to improve the material and moral condition of his capital. The <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> and <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> palaces were restored and decorated, and the Papal treasure, which had been preserved at <a href="01801a.htm">Assisi</a> since the days of <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, was distributed to the city churches. The unemployed were put to work in the neglected gardens of the Vatican, and corn was distributed in seasons of scarcity; at the same time the discipline of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was restored, and the frequentation of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> encouraged. One of Urban's first acts was to change the Roman constitution, but it may be questioned whether "the sacrifice offered to the Pontiff as the reward of his return was the liberty of the people" (Gregorovius).</p>

<p>On 17 October, 1368, the emperor joined the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. Before leaving <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> he had confirmed all the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and Urban hoped for his help against the Visconti, but Charles allowed himself to be bribed. On 21 Oct. the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor entered <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> together, the latter humbly leading the pontiff's mule. On 1 Nov. Charles acted as <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> at the Mass at which Urban <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> the empress. For more than a century <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor had not appeared thus in amity. A year later the Emperor of the East, John V Palaeologus, came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> seeking assistance against the infidel; he <a href="01044d.htm">abjured</a> the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> and was received by Urban on the steps of <a href="13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. These emperors both of West and East were but shadows of their great predecessors, and their visits, triumphs as they might appear, were but little gain to Urban V. He felt that his position in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was insecure. The death of Albornoz (24 Aug., 1367), who had made his return to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> possible, had been a great loss. The restlessness of the towns was exemplified by the revolt of <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, which had to be crushed by force; any chance storm might undo the work of the great <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>. At heart, too, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had all a <a href="06166a.htm">Frenchman's</a> <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for his country, and his French entourage urged his return to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. In vain were the remonstrances of the envoys of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which had gained "greater quiet and order, an influx of wealth, a revival of importance" from his sojourn; in vain were the admonitions of St. Bridget, who came from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="10529a.htm">Montefiascone</a> to warn him that if he returned to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> he would shortly die. War had broken out again between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and the desire to bring about peace strengthened the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> determination. On 5 Sept., 1370, "sad, suffering and deeply moved", Urban embarked at <a href="03798b.htm">Corneto</a>. In a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 26 June he had told the Romans that his departure was motived by his desire to be useful to the Universal Church and to the country to which he was going. It may be, too, that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> saw that the next <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> would be free at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> but not in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a> joyfully sent a fleet of richly adorned galleys to Corneto; the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> did not long survive his return (24 Sept.) to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. His body was buried in Notre-Dame des Doms at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> but was removed two years later, in accordance with his own wish, to the Abbey Church of St. Victor at <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. <a href="10338a.htm">Miracles</a> multiplied around his <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a>. His <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> was demanded by King Waldemar of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and promised by <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> as early as 1375, but did not take place owing to the disorders of the time. His cultus was approved by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1870.</p>

<p>Urban V was a man whose motives cannot be called in question: his policy aimed at Eurpoean peace; shortly before his death he had given orders that preparations should be made to enable him personally to visit and reconcile <a href="05321a.htm">Edward III</a> and <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. He had shown great <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. On 29 March, 1363, Pierre de Lusignan, King of <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and titular King of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, appeared at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to appeal for assistance against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and on 31 March (<a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>) Urban preached the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusade</a> and gave the cross to the Kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>; the <a href="03691a.htm">chivalrous</a> King John, who was to have been chief commander, died a quasi-prisoner at <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> in 1364, and though the King of <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> captured Alexandria (11 Oct., 1365), he was unable to hold the city. The crusading spirit was dead in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In an age of corruption and <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> Urban stood for purity and disinterestedness in church life: he did much for <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and caused many provincial councils to be held; he refused to bestow place or money on his relatives, and even caused his own father to refund a pension bestowed on him by the French king. His brother, whom he prompted to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, was acknowledged by all to be a man most worthy of the dignity. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> private life was that of a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, and he was always accessible to those who sought his aid.</p>

<p>But Urban was a patriotic <a href="06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, a defect in the universal father of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. He estranged the English king by the help given to his rival, and aroused hostility in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> by the favour shown to men of his own race whom he made his representatives in the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. He was a great patron of learning, founded <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> at Cracow (by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1364) and at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1365), and caused the emperor to create the University of Orange; he revised the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>; and gave great assistance to the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="02160a.htm">Avignon</a> and <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. At Bologna he supported the great college founded by Albornoz and paid the expenses of many poor students whom he sent thither. He also founded a <em>studium</em> at Trets (later removed to Manosque), but his greatest foundations were at <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. His buildings and restorations were considerable, especially at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. He approved the orders of <a href="02785a.htm">Brigittines</a> and Gesuati, and <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> his godfather, <a href="05397a.htm">St. Elz&eacute;ar of Sabran</a>.</p>
