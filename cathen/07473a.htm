<p>(HOE, HOSZ)</p>

<p><a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and Prince-Bishop of <a href="05522a.htm">Ermland</a>; born of German <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> at <a href="04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, 5 May, 1504; died at Capranica, near <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, S August, 1579. He spent his early youth at Cracow and Wilna; and at the age of fifteen, when he was already well versed in German, Polish, and Latin, entered the <a href="04465a.htm">University of Cracow</a>, from which he graduated as Bachelor of Arts in 1520. The <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and talented youth found a patron in Peter Tomicki, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04464c.htm">Cracow</a> and Vice-Chancellor of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, who employed him as private secretary and entrusted to him the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of his nephews. A few years later the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> furnished him with the means to continue his studies at the then famous Universities of Padua and Bologna where, besides perfecting himself in the humanities, he pursued the studies of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. Among his professors at Padua was the famous <a href="07538b.htm">humanist</a>, Lazaro Buonamico; <a href="12201b.htm">Reginald Pole</a> was one of his fellow-students. At Bologna he pursued the humanities under Romulo Amasio, and <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> under Hugo Buoncompagni, the future <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. Among his follow-students here were the future <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> <a href="15069a.htm">Otto Truchsess von Waldburg</a> and Cristoforo Madruzzo. After graduating as doctor of canon and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> at the <a href="02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a> on 8 June, 1534, he returned to Cracow and became secretary in the royal chancery. On the death of Bishop Tomicki (1535) he continued as secretary under the new vice-chancellor, Bishop Choinski of <a href="12166b.htm">Plock</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>About this time begins his intimate friendship with the great neo-Latin poet Dantiscus, then <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04566a.htm">Culm</a>. After the death of Bishop Choinski in 1538, Hosius was appointed royal secretary. In this position he had the entire confidence of King Sigismund, who bestowed various <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> upon him as reward for his faithful services. He already held a provostship at Wielun, and another at Vislica. To these the king added a <a href="03252a.htm">canonry</a> at Frauenburg in 1538, at Cracow in 1540, and at <a href="13436b.htm">Sandomir</a> in 1542. In 1543 Hosius was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and in addition to the above-mentioned <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, received the <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Golombie and Radlow in 1546. King Sigismund died in 1548, but before his death he had instructed his son and successor, Sigismund II, to nominate Hosius for the next vacant <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. When, therefore, in 1549, Bishop Giese of <a href="04566a.htm">Culm</a> was transferred to the <a href="05522a.htm">See of Ermland</a>, the young king nominated Hosius for the <a href="04566a.htm">See of Culm</a>. Hosius had not sought after this dignity and accepted it only with reluctance. The <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> arrived in September, 1549; but before taking possession of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, Hosius was sent by Sigismund on an important mission to the courts of King Ferdinand I at <a href="12338a.htm">Prague</a>, and <a href="03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and <a href="06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. The mission resulted in an offensive and defensive alliance between <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and these two monarchies. Upon his return to <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> he received episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> at Cracow on 23 March, 1550, and immediately took possession of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. On 25 July, 1550, <a href="08564a.htm">Pope Julius III</a> appointed him "Inquisitor h&aelig;retic&aelig; pravitatis" for the neighbouring Diocese of Pomesania, which was rapidly turning <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The enticing doctrines of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> were also making alarming headway in the <a href="04566a.htm">Diocese of Culm</a>, and it was with great difficulty that Hosius succeeded in stemming their progress. His first pastoral letters show his deep concern for the preservation of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> among his flock; and his religious colloquies with some of the reformers at Thorn give testimony of his untiring <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of those who had already left the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> fold. But the field of his activities was soon to be changed. The king nominated him for the more important <a href="05522a.htm">Diocese of Ermland</a> in January, 1551, whereupon the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="05522a.htm">Ermland</a> postulated him on 2 March, 1551, and <a href="08564a.htm">Julius III</a> transferred him to that see on 27 April, 1551. Upon receiving the <a href="03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> he left L&ouml;bau, where he had resided while <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04566a.htm">Culm</a>, and took possession of the <a href="05522a.htm">Diocese of Ermland</a> on 21 July.</p>

<p>As <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05522a.htm">Ermland</a> Hosius devoted all his efforts to the maintenance of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>. His great learning and wide experience, coupled with deep <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, made him the natural leader of the Polish episcopate in its struggle against <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> which was making deep inroads into <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> during the rule of the weak and vacillating King Sigismund II. For the first seven years of his episcopate he served the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause chiefly by his numerous polemical writings in defence of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. He had already in his youth given <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of his literary ability by composing various Latin poems; and as early as 1528 he had published, in the original and with a Latin translation, the short treatise of <a href="08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> in which a parallel is drawn between a king and a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>. In 1535 he had also written a lengthy biography of his deceased patron, Bishop Tomicki. All these writings have been published by Hipler in the first volume of his collection of the letters of Hosius (Cracow, 1879). Shortly after his appointment to the <a href="05522a.htm">See of Ermland</a> he took part in the provincial Synod of Piotrkow, in June, 1551. On this occasion the assembled <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> entrusted him with the drawing up of a Profession of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, to which they all subscribed and which they agreed to publish. Afterwards Hosius expanded these articles into an elaborate exposition of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> "Confessio fidei catholic&aelig; christian&aelig;", part of which was published at Cracow in 1553, the remainder at Mains in 1557. The work is one of the best pieces of polemical literature produced during the period of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. In faultless Latin the author places the whole array of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a> in contrast with the opposing doctrines of the reformers, and proves by means of irresistible arguments, drawn from <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> and patristic literature, that <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> is strictly identical with <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The work became so popular that more than thirty editions of it were printed during the lifetime of the author, and translations were made into German, Polish, English, <a href="13613a.htm">Scotch</a>, French, Italian, <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a>, <a href="10561a.htm">Moravian</a>, Arabic, and <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>. About the same time he completed another work of a similar nature. His friend <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11756c.htm&quot;">Peter Canisius</a> wrote its preface and entitled it: "Ver&aelig;, christian&aelig; catholic&aelig;que doctrin&aelig; solida propugnatio una cum illustri confutatione prolegomenorum, quae primum Jo. Brentius adversus Petrum a Soto theologum scripsit, deinde vero Petrus Paulus Vergerius apud Polonos temere defendenda suscepit" (Cologne, 1558). As its title indicates, it was chiefly a refutation of the Suabian reformer, John Brenz, whose "Confessio Wirtembergica", with a dedication to the King of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, had recently been republished at Cracow by the <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="01624b.htm">apostate</a>, <a href="15353b.htm">Bishop Vergerio</a>. About twelve editions of this work were printed. In the same year two other works of Hosius were published at <a href="04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, viz. "Dialogus de communione s. eucharisti&aelig; sub utraque specie; de conjugio sacerdotum et de sacro in vulgari lingua celebrando", which was immediately translated into German; and "De expresso verbo Dei", in which he reproves the reformers for their abuse of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. It was re-edited in <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, etc., and translated into German and Polish. A year later he published a work of similar nature, which he entitled: "De oppresso verbo Dei". Besides writing these learned treatises in defence of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>, Hosius left nothing undone to gain the co-operation of the king and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> for concerted action against the tide of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The king, however, as well as many of the Polish <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, remained inactive.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The fame of Hosius had meanwhile spread throughout <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> wished to enlist the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> among his advisers during those troublous times of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In May, 1558, he was called to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and at once became one of the most influential members of the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>. During his absence from <a href="05522a.htm">Ermland</a> he left the administration of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the hands of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> died on 18 August, 1559, and his successor, <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, sent Hosius as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to the imperial court of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, with instructions to make arrangements with Emperor Ferdinand I for the reopening of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and, if possible, to bring back to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> the emperor's son, Prince Maximilian of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, who had become an open adherent of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Hosius easily gained the co-operation of the emperor for the council, but the conversion of Maximilian was more difficult. John Sebastian Pfauser, a reformer at the imperial court, had trained the prince in the doctrines of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, and had put him in correspondence with the <a href="01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="15353b.htm">Vergerio</a>, who had engendered in him a deep <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and everything <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. For two months Hosius tried in vain to have a conference with Maximilian. When, finally, in the early part of June (1560) he procured an audience, the prince remained obdurate in his <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but the clear reasoning of Hosius made a deep impression upon him. He began to read the writings of Hosius and willingly listened to him until finally the <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> reasoning and the edifying example of Hosius won him back to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In recognition of these services <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> created Hosius <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on 26 February, 1561. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> had been offered him before but he persistently refused the dignity, and would have refused it again had not the emperor as well as the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> insisted on his accepting it. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, moreover, on 10 March, 1561, appointed him one of the five <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a> who were to preside over the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which was to reopen in April. At the council he was a strenuous defender of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, and used his great influence to bring the council to a successful close.</p>

<p>Immediately after the termination of the council, on 4 December, 1563, he returned to <a href="05522a.htm">Ermland</a>, where <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> had made considerable progress during his absence. In union with the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> <a href="03223a.htm">Commendone</a> he brought about the acceptance of the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> decrees at the royal Diet of Parczow on 7 August, 1564. After making a general visitation of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> he convened a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> at Heilsberg in August, 1565, where the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> decrees were <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> and measures taken concerning a better <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> as well as the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>. During the same year he gave over to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> the direction of the <a href="13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> which he had founded at Braunsberg. These institutions, viz, the <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>, the gymnasium, and the Lyceum Hosianum are still in existence. About this time he also composed two more polemical treatises which were published at Cologne. The first one is entitled: "Judicium et censura de judicio et censura Heidelbergensium Tigurinorumque ministrorum de dogmate contra adorandam Trinitatem in Polonia nuper sparso" (1564). In this work Hosius acknowledges the force of the arguments of the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> against the Trinitarians, but informs them that the same arguments may be used against themselves, and that the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Trinitarians have their ultimate foundation in the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. The second, "De loco et authoritate Romani Pontificis", is an able defence of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. In 1567 he wrote "Palinodi&aelig; Quadrantini" or the recantations of Fabian Quadrantinus, a convert to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> who afterwards became a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. After the death of <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, on 9 December, 1565, some of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> cast their vote for Hosius as his successor, but <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> was the successful candidate. In December, 1566, the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Hosius <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> <em>a latere</em> for <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and in 1569 Sigismund Augustus made him his resident representative at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. With the consent of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the king, Hosius appointed his friend Martin Cromer as his coadjutor, and entrusted him with the administration of <a href="05522a.htm">Ermland</a>, while he himself left for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 20 August, 1569.</p>

<p>During the ten succeeding years he managed the affairs of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> in the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, and was one of the most influential advisers of the saintly <a href="12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a> and his successor, <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, in their movement for a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reform; he also took an active part in the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> efforts to restore <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and especially in <a href="14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. In 1572 <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> made him a member of the new Congregatio Germanica, and a year later appointed him grand penitentiary. Hosius was one of the greatest men of his time. He did more for the preservation of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> than all the other Polish <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> combined. He was withal, a man of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and great liberality towards the poor. Both <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> looked upon him as a saint. <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11756c.htm&quot;">Peter Canisius</a> styles him "the most brilliant writer, the most eminent <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> and the best <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his times" (Hipler, Hosii Epistol&aelig;, I, 422). Editions of his works were published at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1562), Lyons (1564), Antwerp (1566 and 1571), <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1573), and (best edition) Cologne (1584). His German sermons were edited by Hipler: "Die deutschen Predigten und Katechesen der erml&auml;ndischen Bisch&ouml;fe Hosius und Cromer" (Cologne, 1885). The publication of his numerous letters has been begun by Hipler and Zakrzewski, vols. I and II (Cracow, 1879 and 1888). The letters in these two volumes cover a period of 33 years (1525-1558). Other letters are found among those of <a href="11756c.htm">Peter Canisius</a>, edited by Braunsberger (Freiburg, 1897-1905).</p>
