<p>(A<font size=-2>RNAUT, or </font>A<font size=-2>RNAULT</font>.)</p>

<p>A celebrated <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, the history of which is intimately connected with that of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>. Though originally of Auvergne, the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> fixed its seat, about the middle of the sixteenth century, in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where several members distinguished themselves at the Bar. Antoine* Arnauld (1560-1619) was a famous lawyer in the Assembly of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and a Counsellor of State under <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>. His fame rested on a speech (1594) in favour of the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> and against the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and on several political pamphlets. The best known of his writings is entitled "Le franc et v&eacute;ritable discours du Roi sur le r&eacute;tablissement qui lui est d&eacute;mand&eacute; des J&eacute;suites" (1602). By his marriage with Catherine Marion he had twenty children, ten of whom survived him. Six of these were girls, all religious of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>, two of whom are especially famous, Ang&eacute;lique and M&#232;re Agn&#232;s. Three of the four sons achieved eminence: Arnauld d'Andilly, Henri, and Antoine. Following the order of their fame, we shall speak successively of Antoine, Ang&eacute;lique, d'Andilly, and Henri.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section1">Antoine Arnauld</h2>

<p>Surnamed the Great, b. in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1612; d. at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 8 August, 1694; was the twentieth and last child of the Arnauld <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. Bereaved of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> at the age of seven, his youth was spent entirely under the influence of his mother and his sister Ang&eacute;lique, and through them of the <a href="05218a.htm">Abb&eacute; of Saint-Cyran</a>. At their solicitation he gave up the study of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> for which he <a href="02408b.htm">believed</a> he had a decided <a href="15498a.htm">vocation</a>, and devoted himself to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. He read many of the writings of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, but it was through the eyes of <a href="05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a>. In 1635, six years before the publication of Jansen's book, the "Augustinus", he successfully maintained theses on grace, for the <a href="01756c.htm">bachelor's degree</a>. Even so early he made the distinction between the two states of innocence and corrupt <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>; and also spoke of the efficacy of grace in itself. This was a sort of prelude to the book of the <a href="08285a.htm">Bishop of Ypres</a>.</p>

<p>The young bachelor then wished to enter the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, but <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, who <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> of his connection with <a href="05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a>, then a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Vincennes (1638), opposed him, and he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to wait until after the death of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1643. Meanwhile he had been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> (1641), at the age of twenty-nine, and the same year had sustained with brilliant success his theses for the doctorate, in which he showed the influence of <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a> and <a href="05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a>. Soon afterwards he assailed the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the champions of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. <a href="14027c.htm">Father Sirmond</a> was the first object of his attacks (1641), which later turned against the whole <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> in the tract "Th&eacute;ologie morale des J&eacute;suites", a precursor of the Lettres provinciales" (1643).</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards appeared the celebrated treatise "De la fr&eacute;quente Communion". Arnauld's adversary was again a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father de Sesmaisons, who had written a learned refutation of <a href="05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran's</a> work opposing <a href="06278a.htm">frequent Communion</a>. Arnauld's book, written at the suggestion of <a href="05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a>, who even reviewed the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, stirred up a whirlwind. Misled by the ostentatious display of <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> learning, and the affected <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the author for ancient <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> and the primitive purity of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, serious readers allowed themselves to be ensnared. The public, moreover, was flattered by the semblance of being appealed to as a tribunal on the most controverted questions of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, all of which Arnauld had taken into consideration when he wrote the book in French. The treatise found warm partisans in all classes of <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, even among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> themselves. But adversaries were also aroused. Arnauld was attacked, refuted, <a href="04733b.htm">denounced</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He escaped censure, but of the thirty-one propositions condemned in 1690 by <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> three were extracts taken almost word for word from Arnauld's book summarizing his doctrine.</p>

<p>The consequences of this work were most pernicious. According to the testimony of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> there was a noticeable decrease in the frequentation of the <a href="13295a.htm">Sacraments</a>. By exacting a too rigid preparation and a purity of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> and perfection of life unattainable by many <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, Arnauld set up a barrier to <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> that kept many away. He forgot that the reception of the Eucharist is not the reward of <a href="15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but the remedy for infirmities, and under the pretext of <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> he prevented the faithful from approaching the source of all <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the "Augustinus", condemned by <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1641), was a <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a> of controversy. Hubert, a doctor of the faculty of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="04733b.htm">denounced</a> it from the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of Notre-Dame, and was answered by Arnauld in two "Apologies de M. Jansenius", in which he sustained the doctrines of the <a href="08285a.htm">Bishop of Ypres</a>. A little later <a href="04379a.htm">Doctor Cornet</a>, by selecting from the "Augustinus" five propositions, which summarized its <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>, and endeavouring to have them censured, aroused bitter discussion. Arnauld thereupon published his "Consid&eacute;rations sur l'entreprise", which made it appear that it was the doctrine of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> himself that was being condemned. This work was followed by another defence of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>: "Apologie pour les Saints P&#232;res de l'&Eacute;glise, d&eacute;fenseurs de la gr&#226;ce de J&eacute;sus-Christ contre les erreurs qui leur sont impos&eacute;es".</p>

<p>In the meantime the champions of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> had prepared at Saint-Lazare, under the eyes of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, an address to <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>, asking for the condemnation of the five propositions. In the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Cum Occasione" the first four were condemned as <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and the fifth as <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> and rash (1653). The <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> subscribed to the condemnation of these propositions, understood according to <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> interpretation, but denied that this was the interpretation of the "Augustinus". According to them the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, while <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> in passing judgment on a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, ceased to be <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> when there was a question of attributing a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to a given <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> or book. This was the famous distinction between fact and <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, later so dear to both parties.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>About this time Picot&eacute;, a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="13378a.htm">Saint-Sulpice</a>, required of a penitent, the Duc de Liancourt, under penalty of refusing him <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>, that he submit to the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> and withdraw from all intimate connection with the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. Thereupon Arnauld, their leader, gave vent to his indignation in two "letters to a duke and peer" (1655). He maintained that the Duke was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to condemn the five propositions, but that he could refuse to <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> that they were found in the "Augustinus". On the latter point, he said, there was no <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> towards the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> save a respectful silence. These letters drew down upon his head the wrath of the Theological Faculty, which censured the two following propositions taken from the letters: (1) That the five condemned propositions are not in the Augustinus; (2) that grace has ever been lacking to a <a href="08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="09580c.htm">man</a>, on any occasion when he committed <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. One hundred and thirty <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> signed this censure, and Arnauld was excluded forever from the Faculty. Then <a href="11511a.htm">Pascal</a> came to his friend's assistance and wrote, under the pseudonym of Montalte, his "Provincial Letters". The first four took up Arnauld's quarrel and <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>; eleven were devoted to attacks on the <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> code of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; and the last three reviewed the questions of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, and particularly the distinction between <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and fact. But the <a href="01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a>, in 1656, asserted the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> of passing <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> judgment on <a href="05092a.htm">dogmatic facts</a> as well as <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the same year <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> published the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad Sanctam", affirming with all his authority that the five propositions were drawn from the "Augustinus" and were condemned in the sense of their author.</p>

<p>As soon as this <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> was received by the <a href="01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a> (1657) it was published in all <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and a <a href="06141a.htm">formulary</a> of submission prepared for signature. The <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, under the leadership of Arnauld, refused to subscribe. On the intervention of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> they signed the <a href="06141a.htm">formulary</a> with many <a href="10195b.htm">mental reservations</a>, but, claiming that it lacked authority, they attacked it in many writings, either composed or inspired by Arnauld. <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> at the request of the <a href="09371a.htm">king</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> published a new <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> (1664), enjoining subscription under canonical and civil penalties. Four <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among them Henri Arnauld, of Angers, who dared to resist, were condemned by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and a court was appointed by the <a href="09371a.htm">king</a> to pass judgment on their action. <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> died in the interval. Thereupon the four dissenters sent to the <a href="01795a.htm">French Clergy</a> a circular prepared by Arnauld, denying to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, in the name of Gallican liberty, the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> of judging the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the kingdom.</p>

<p>On further consideration, however, they conformed exteriorly to the <a href="06141a.htm">formulary</a>. <a href="04028a.htm">Clement IX</a>, desirous of putting an end to these dissensions, granted them what is known as the "Clementine Peace", extending it to all the leaders of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> in consideration of submission. This submission, however, as the future <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>, was merely external. Arnauld was presented to the <a href="11160a.htm">Nuncio</a>, to <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and the whole court, and was everywhere accorded the reception merited by his talents and learning. At this <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> he composed in connection with <a href="11068b.htm">Nicole</a>, and at the suggestion of <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, the most learned of his controversial works, entitled "La Perp&eacute;tuit&eacute; de la foi de l'&Eacute;glise catholique sur l'Eucharistie". This work, praised by <a href="04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> and <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, who congratulated the author upon it, caused a sensation, and struck a heavy blow at <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. It was soon followed by another "Renversement de la morale de J&eacute;sus-Christ par les calvinistes". Meanwhile Arnauld, who was still a <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> at heart, was diffusing his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, noiselessly, however, in order to preserve peace. People flocked to <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>, and Arnauld was the centre of assemblies which were viewed with suspicion. <a href="05525a.htm">Error</a> was making considerable progress, to the alarm of both religious and royal authorities.</p>

<p>The storm was about to burst, but Arnauld escaped it by retiring to the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> (1679), where he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to remain until his death (1694). During these fifteen years his activity never abated. He was constantly plying his pen, and always in a belligerent spirit. He attacked the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; he attacked the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; he even attacked <a href="09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>. His "Apologie du clerg&eacute; de France et des catholiques d'Angleterre contre le ministre Jurieu" (1681) aroused the wrath of that champion of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, who answered in a monograph entitled "L'Esprit de M. Arnauld". The aged leader of the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> refrained from refuting a writing into which his personality had been dragged, and which was nothing but a mass of coarse insults. He was none the less zealous, however, in his attacks upon <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> in an immense number of treatises. He even attacked William of Orange.</p>

<p>In Arnauld's eyes <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were always to be treated as personal enemies. Every writing that issued from the hand of a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> furnished him an occasion to denounce the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> to the public, and to publish a refutation if he chanced to find in it any <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> contrary to his own. Two volumes appeared in 1669 and 1683 respectively, entitled "Morale pratique des J&eacute;suites, repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e en plusieurs histoires ariv&eacute;es dans toutes les parties du monde". Their author, de Pontch&#226;teau, was a solitary of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>, who was exceedingly hostile to missionary <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Father Le Tellier replied in his "La D&eacute;fense des nouveaux chr&eacute;tiens et des missionnaires de la Chine, du Japon et des Indes" (1687). Arnauld thereupon constituted himself the champion of de Pontch&#226;teau's works and published between 1690 and 1693 five additional books. He was working on the sixth, "La Calomnie", at the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of his death. This work is biased and full of prejudice. He retails without reserve or moderation, and with evident malice, all the differences and quarrels which had arisen among men of <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a>, or between religious communities engaged in the same work, without having the limits of their respective <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> clearly defined. According to Arnauld the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were always in the wrong, and he relates with calm credulity everything that the ill will of their enemies had attributed to them, without concerning himself as to the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of these statements.</p>

<p><a href="09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>, the Oratorian, differed with him on the subject of grace, and expressed his views in his "Trait&eacute; de la Nature et de la Gr&#226;ce". Arnauld attempted to stop its publication, and, failing, he opened a campaign against <a href="09568a.htm">Malebranche</a> (1683). Without attempting to refute the treatise, he took up the opinion that "we see all in <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>", laid down by the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in a preceeding work, "Recherche de la v&eacute;rit&eacute;", and attacked it in "Des vraies et des fausses id&eacute;es". <a href="09568a.htm">Malebranche</a> objected to this shifting of the question, claiming that to bring before the public a purely <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> problem to be refuted and confounded with the weapons of ridicule was unworthy of a great <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>. Arnauld now showed no moderation whatever, even going to the point of attributing to <a href="09568a.htm">Malebranche</a> opinions which he had never held. His "Philosophical and Theological Relations" on the "Trait&eacute; de la Nature et de la Gr&#226;ce" (1685) scored a triumph for the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> party, but it lessened in nowise the prestige of <a href="09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>. The latter had the advantage of moderation, notwithstanding more than one bitter line directed against his antagonist, and he confessed himself "weary of furnishing the world a spectacle, and having the 'Journal des Savants' filled with their respective platitudes". Nevertheless the quarrel ended only with the death of Arnauld.</p>

<p><a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> had not been forgotten, and Arnauld was to the last its <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a>, untiring champion. It is impossible to enumerate all his writings in its defence. The majority were anonymous, so that they might reach <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> more easily. His "New Defense of the Mons New Testament" &mdash; a version which had emanated from <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> &mdash; is the most <a href="15446a.htm">violent</a> of all his works. We may also mention the "Phant&ocirc;me du Jans&eacute;nisme" (1686), from which the author hoped great results for his <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. He proposed in this work "to justify the so-called <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> by showing <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> to be nothing but a phantom, as there is no one in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> who holds any of the five condemned propositions, and it is not forbidden to discuss whether or not these propositions have been taught by <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>".</p>

<p>On this last point Arnauld was always immovable, constantly inventing new subterfuges to prevent himself from seeing the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. Sainte-Beauve was not wrong in writing (Port Royal, bk. III, viii) that "the persistence in knowing better than the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> what they think and define is the favourite thesis of the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, beginning with Arnauld". In 1700 the <a href="01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy of France</a> condemned this proposition: "Jansenism is a phantom", as <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>, <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a>, rash, injurious to the <a href="01795a.htm">French Clergy</a>, to the <a href="12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a>, to the Universal <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>"; as "schismatical and favouring the condemned <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>".</p>

<p>Arnauld died at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, at the age of eighty-two. Nicole, who had accompanied him into exile, had, by revising his writings, kept him for a time within the bounds of moderation, but when Nicole was replaced by <a href="12601c.htm">Father Quesnel</a> of the <a href="11271a.htm">Oratory</a>, Arnauld allowed himself all the extremes of language, and his passion for polemics was given full scope. He died in the arms of <a href="12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, who administered <a href="05716a.htm">Extreme Unction</a> and the <a href="15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, although he had no power to do so. He was <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> privately, and his heart taken to <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>. <a href="02623a.htm">Boileau</a>, <a href="12630b.htm">Racine</a>, and Santeuil composed for him epitaphs which have become famous.</p>

<p>Arnauld's works are classed under five heads: on belles-lettres and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; on grace; controversial works against <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; those against the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; on <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The mass of his writings is enormous, and seldom read to-day. There is no pretence at style. He was a learned man and a subtle <a href="09324a.htm">logician</a>, but he entirely ignored the art of persuading and pleasing, and his <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> teachings mar his best pages. His "Grammaire g&eacute;n&eacute;rale", and "Logique" are the works most easily read.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Jacqueline-Marie-Ang&#201;lique Arnauld</h2>

<p>Sister of the preceeding, b. 1591, d. 6 August, 1661, was the third of the twenty children of Antoine* Arnauld. While still a child she showed great keenness of <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> and wonderful endowments in mind, will, and character. To please her grandfather Marion, the advocate, she consented to become a religious, but only on condition that she be made <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>. At the age of eight (1599) she took the habit of a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> at the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint-Antoine in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. She was soon transferred (1600) to the Abbey of Maubuisson, ruled by Ang&eacute;lique d'Estr&eacute;es, sister of the beautiful Gabrielle d'Estr&eacute;es, mistress of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>. The child was brought up in liberty, luxury, and <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and was left entirely to her own impetuous and fantastic impulses. At Confirmation she took the name Ang&eacute;lique, in compliment to the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, and gave up that of Jacqueline, which she had hitherto borne. A reprehensible <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a> of the Arnaulds obtained from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> abbatial bulls for Ang&eacute;lique, then eleven years of age. She was named coadjutrix to the <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> (1602) and continued to live, as she had lived before, without serious irregularities, but also without <a href="15753a.htm">religious fervour</a>. Her days were taken up with walks, profane reading, and visits outside the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, all of which could not prevent a deadly ennui which nothing could dispel. "Instead of praying", she tells us, "I set myself to read novels and Roman history". She felt drawn by no call. Too proud to retrace her steps, at the age of seventeen she confirmed the promise made at eight and, "bursting with spite", signed a formula her father placed before her, which was to forge on her forever the heavy chain of a vocation imposed on her. A sermon preached by a visiting <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> (1608) was the occasion of her <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a>. She resolved to change her mode of life at once, and to effect a reform in her <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. She began with herself, and determined, despite every obstacle, to follow the rules of her order in all their rigour. She had <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> trouble in encompassing the reform of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>, but she succeeded, and such was the steadfastness of the young <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> that she closed the doors of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> to her own father and brothers despite their indignant protests. This was the "day of the grating" which remained famous in the annals of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. After the reform of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>, M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique undertook to recall to a regular life the abbey of Maubuisson, six leagues from <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where <a href="13506d.htm">scandals</a> were frequent. Ang&eacute;lique d'Estr&eacute;es, the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, led such a life that her sister Gabrielle reproached her as being "the disgrace of our house". It is impossible to tell in a few lines what patience, <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, and gentle, persistent firmness were <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to bring about this reform. M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique was guided and sustained at this time by <a href="06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>. She even thought of abandoning the <a href="04515c.htm">crosier</a> to enter the <a href="15481a.htm">Visitation Order</a>, which the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> had just founded. She was one of those characters, however, who yield before those they consider superiors, but stand firm and immovable in the face of others. The saint understanding her, gently diverted her from this project. The years that followed (1620-30) were the best years for <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>, years of regularity, <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. There were many <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>; the reputation of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> went far and wide. In 1625, thinking ;that the valley of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> was unhealthy for her religious, M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique established them all in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in the Faubourg Saint-Jacques. It was at this time that the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> made the acquaintance of Zamet, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08789c.htm">Langres</a>, who had reformed the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Tard, near <a href="04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, and was thinking of founding an order in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. He considered the fusion of the two <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> an opportunity sent by Providence. He broached it to the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, who agreed to the project, and together they began the erection of a new <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> near the Louvre. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> sumptuous taste, however, contrasted with the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess's</a> spirit of austere poverty. M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique, being self-willed to the point of falling ill when opposed, wished to have it built according to her <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> and to impose her will on those around her. She was replaced as <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, although it was her sister Agn&#232;s who was elected <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Tard. Even when second in rank Ang&eacute;lique gave as much trouble, when the "affair of the Secret Chaplet" caused a diversion. The "Secret Chaplet" was a term used to designate a mystical treatise of twenty pages composed by M&#232;re Agn&#232;s, sister of Ang&eacute;lique, in which the Sacrament of Love was represented as terrible, formidable, and inaccessible. This little book was disturbing, on account of the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> spiritual tendencies it revealed, and it was condemned by the Sorbonne (18 June, 1633). For the first time, <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> was looked on with suspicion, as having clouded the integrity of its <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Nevertheless an anonymous champion had issued a brochure in apology of the "Chaplet", which caused a tremendous <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a>. The author was soon known to be <a href="05218a.htm">Jean du Vergier de Hauranne</a>, Abb&eacute; of Saint-Cyran. M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique had known the Abb&eacute; for ten years, in the character of a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> friend, but she felt no sympathy whatever with his teachings. From 1633, however, she took sides with him, introduced him into her community, and made him the confessor of her religious and the <a href="11264c.htm">oracle</a> of the house. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08789c.htm">Langres</a> tried in vain to displace him, but Ang&eacute;lique entrenched herself deeper in obstinacy. This marks the separation between Tard and <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>; from this time, also, the history of M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique is merged with that of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. <a href="05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a> became master of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>. He took away the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, blinded <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, and subjugated wills. To dispute his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> was regarded as a crime deserving of punishment. About the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> were grouped twelve men of the world, most of them of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Arnauld, who led a life of penance and were called the "Solitaries of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>". Further, M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique had gathered under her <a href="04515c.htm">crosier</a> her five sisters and many of her nieces. It may be said with <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> that the <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> of the seventeenth century was her creation. With <a href="05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a>, it became a centre of alarming <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>. <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> understood this, and caused the arrest (15 May, 1638) of the dangerous Abb&eacute;, and his confinement in the <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> at Vincennes. M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique became more than ever attached to her director, in whom she saw one <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for <a href="08571c.htm">justice'</a> sake. At his death (1643) she found herself without a guide, but her perversion was complete. She retired into an atmosphere of complete and obdurate impassibility, with no thought but to bring about the triumph of the principles held by him whom she had <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a doctor and <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> almost as a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>. During the following years, also, and at the time of the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> issued by <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>, she encouraged by word and by letters the upholders of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. She compared herself to <a href="11582a.htm">St. Paula</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. Far from confining herself within the limits of her <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, she threw herself bodily into the struggle. She propagated her favourite <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>; she continually wrote letters encouraging some and condemning others, among the latter including even <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. Stronger than all the rest in the loftiness of her intelligence and the firmness of her character, M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique was a leader of the party, and a leader who would die sooner than surrender. As a matter of fact, she did expire (6 August, 1661) filled with solicitude for her religious caused by the signing of the Formulary, and her own fear of a "terrible <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>". She left various writings and a collection of letters to be found in the "M&eacute;moires pour servir &#224; l'histoire de Port-Royal" (Utrecht, 1742-44). Her sister Agn&#232;s survived her ten years. We owe to her a work entitled "Image de la religieuse parfaite et imparfaite" (1665). She resisted and suffered much at the time of the Formulary. It was of M&#232;re Agn&#232;s and her religious that De P&eacute;r&eacute;fixe, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, said: "These sisters are as pure as <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, but as proud as <a href="04764a.htm">devils</a>".</p>

<h2 id="section3">Robert Arnauld d'Andilly</h2>

<p>Born 1589, died 27 September, 1674, was the eldest of Antoine* Arnauld's twenty children. On the death of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> in 1619, he became, according to custom, head of his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. With him obstinacy and <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> were hereditary faults; to these were added excessive vehemence and abruptness of temper. It is related that on the "day of the grating" he flew into a passion with his sister Ang&eacute;lique, even to the point of threatening her and calling her a "monster of ingratitude and a parricide", because she refused to allow her father to enter the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. At an early period (1621) he became a friend of <a href="05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a>, and participated in all his <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>. It was not his fault that the <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> did not give her confidence sooner to the famous Abb&eacute;. Like the rest of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, he <a href="07149b.htm">hated</a> the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> as personal enemies, because they were the champions of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. He affected to combine with a regular attendance at court a very ardent <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. He was in great <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> at court and his son Pomponne became Minister of State. He was looked on with favour by the Queen Regent, Anne of Austria, and had powerful friends. The <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> party took advantage of this to obtain the release of <a href="05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a> from the <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> of Vincennes, where he had been confined by <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>. D'Andilly tried to gain over the <a href="01233e.htm">Duchess d'Aiguillon</a>, niece of the <a href="13047a.htm">Cardinal</a>. She went to Rueil to see her uncle, but the minister cut short her <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> by showing her the real state of affairs. It was D'Andilly who persuaded Anne de Rohan, Princesse de Gu&eacute;m&eacute;n&eacute;e, one of his worldly friends, to enter <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>, for to her he played the r&ocirc;le of lay director. On becoming a widower, he left the court and retired to <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a> des Champs, having been preceded by one of his sons, Arnauld de Luzancy (1646). He found three nephews already there: Antoine* Le Ma&#238;tre, Le Ma&#238;tre de Sacy, and de S&eacute;ricourt. For thirty years he lived in this retreat, occupied with literary and manual labour. He chose to cultivate trees, and sent to the queen monstrous fruits which <a href="10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> laughingly called "blessed fruits". During the same period he translated the Jewish historian <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, the works of St. Theresa, and the lives of the Desert Fathers. He also applied himself to poetry, and according to Sainte-Beuve his spiritual canticles are unsurpassed even by the works of Godeau, or even of <a href="04374b.htm">Corneille</a>, certainly of the <a href="04374b.htm">Corneille</a> of the "Imitation". D'Andilly's letters and other prose works (he published a collection of three hundred letters in 1645) are considered in the same class as those of Voltaire and even of Balzac. With regard to the Formulary, he used his influence to avert, or at least mitigate, the persecutions of the religious of <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>. When, in 1659, the order came for the dispersal of the Petites Ecoles, i.e. the twenty or thirty children whom the solitaries were rearing in the pure doctrines of their <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, and the loneliness of the solitaries themselves, Arnauld d'Andilly wrote innumerable letters to Anne of Austria and <a href="10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>, letters of submission, of commendation, of thanks. He gave his word that the orders would be obeyed; he temporized, and obtained respites, and although he was a factious spirit, he caused, on the whole, but little apprehension, and was allowed to write, to plot, and even to dogmatize at his ease. All these things, dangerous in themselves, in his hands took on a sort of worldly grace, as being light and destitute of malice. Moreover, who would have dared to disturb him whom the queen had asked "if he always <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> her". He died at the age of eighty-five, preserving to the end his bodily and <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> vigour. He reared three sons and four daughters. We have from his pen, in addition to the works mentioned, translations of the "Confessions of St. Augustine", the "Scala paradisi" of <a href="08457a.htm">St. John Climacus</a>, the "De contemptu mundi" of <a href="05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a>, and the memoirs of his life. The last work reveals in the author a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> vanity which amounts to boastfulness.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Henri Arnauld</h2>

<p>Brother of the preceding, b. in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1597; d. 1692. He was first destined for the Bar, but was taken to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="02483a.htm">Cardinal Bentivoglio</a>, and during this absence, which lasted five years, the court granted him (1624) the Abbey of Saint-Nicholas. In 1637 the Chapter of Toul offered him the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of that city, and the king, at the recommendation of Father Joseph, confirmed the choice. He was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to wait three years for his <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, which were delayed by the difficulties between the court and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. At the time of the quarrel between <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> and the Barberini, Henri Arnauld was sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as charg&eacute; d'affaires of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. He acquitted himself of this mission with much adroitness. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> could not deny him the return of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, who were reinstated in their possessions and dignities. He returned from this mission with the reputation of being one of the most politic <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> in the kingdom. Being offered the Bishopric of P&eacute;rigeux (1650), he refused, but accepted that of Angers in which was situated his Abbey of Saint-Nicholas. During his episcopate of forty-two years, he showed less <a href="12517b.htm">Christian prudence</a> than extraordinary ability in the service of the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> and of his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. Having once entered on this path, he concentrated all his energies to keep from yielding, and thus to save his own <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> and that of his brother Antoine. This involved him in many difficulties, caused many dissensions in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and resulted in the cloud which still clings to his name. His entrance into the quarrel aroused by <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> was most exciting. When <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> ordered the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to sign the Formulary drawn up by the <a href="01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a> in 1661, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01489b.htm">Angers</a> wrote a letter to the king sustaining the famous distinction of Nicole between "fact" and "law". The king having shown marked displeasure, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> wrote to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> a letter of the same import, but <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> made no reply. The obstinate <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> then wrote to P&eacute;r&eacute;fixe, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to forestall the tempest which the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of signing the Formulary would arouse at <a href="12295a.htm">Port-Royal</a>. At the same time he encouraged the religious to resist or take refuge in subtleties which took all sincerity from their submission. Arnauld was one of the four <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> who in 1665 loftily refused to sign the Formulary of <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, and issued a mandate against it. He was about to be cited before an <a href="04447a.htm">ecclesiastical tribunal</a> when the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> died. <a href="04028a.htm">Clement IX</a>, successor to <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, judged it preferable in the interests of religion to silence the whole affair. He accorded the Clementine Peace to this party, and they insolently took advantage of it. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> preserved his <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> sentiments to the very end, and did all in his power to promote the spread of this <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He pursued with disfavour, and sometimes with vehemence, the partisans of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. One should read the "M&eacute;moires" of Joseph Grandet, third superior of the Seminary of Angers, to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> to what a degree <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> had imbued the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who otherwise was not deficient in good qualities. It cannot be denied that he was energetic, austere, devoted to his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, and filled with <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. In 1652, when the queen mother was approaching to inflict punishment on the city of Angers, which was in revolt, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> appeased her with a word. On giving her <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, he said: "Receive, Madame, your <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, Who pardoned His enemies when dying on the Cross." There is still quoted a saying of his illustrating his <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of work. One day, on being requested to take a day each week for relaxation, he replied: "I shall willingly do so, if you give me a day on which I am not <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>." But despite this excellent sentiment he remains one of the most enigmatical figures of the seventeenth-century episcopate. He died in 1692, at the ripe old age of ninety-five. The negotiations carried on by him at the Court of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and various Italian courts have been published in five volumes (Paris, 1745).</p>
