<h2 id="section1">Character of the order</h2>

<p>The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Fontevrault was founded by <a href="13096a.htm">Blessed Robert d'Arbrissel</a> about the end of 1100 and is situated in a wooded valley on the confines of Anjou, <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and Poitou, about two and a half miles south of the Loire, at a short distance west of its union with the Vienne. It was a <a href="10452a.htm">"double" monastery</a>, containing separate <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> for both <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The government was in the hands of the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>. This arrangement was said to be based upon the text of St. John (xix, 27), "Behold thy Mother", but want of capacity among the brethren who surrounded the founder would seem to be the most natural explanation. To have placed the fortunes of the rising institute in feeble hands might have compromised its existence, while amongst the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> he found <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> endowed with high qualities and in every way fitted for government. Certainly the long series of able abbesses of Fontevrault is in some measure a justification of the founder's provision.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Fontevrault was the earliest of the three orders which adopted the double form and it may be useful to point out the chief differences in rule and government which mark it off from the similar institutions of the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="06557b.htm">St. Gilbert of Sempringham</a>, founded in 1135 (see Gilbertines), and that of the <a href="14347a.htm">Swedish</a> princess, St. Bridgett, founded in 1344 (see <a href="02785a.htm">Brigittines</a>). At Fontevrault both <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> followed the <a href="02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> (see below, II), as did the Gilbertine <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, but the male religious of that order were canons regular and followed the <a href="02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. The <a href="02785a.htm">Brigittines</a> of both sexes were under the Regular Salvatoris, an adaptation and completion of the Augustinian Rule. The <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Fontevrault was supreme over all the religious of the order, and the heads of the dependent houses were <a href="12428a.htm">prioresses</a>. Each <a href="02785a.htm">Brigittine</a> house was independent, and was ruled by an <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> who was supreme in all temporalities, but in matters spiritual was forbidden to interfere with the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, who were under the confessor general. The head of the Gilbertines was a canon, the "Master" or "Prior of All", who was not attached to any one house; his power was absolute over the whole order. All three orders were primarily founded for <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> being added for their direction or spiritual service, and in all three the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> had control of the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the order. The habit of the Fontevrist <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> was a white tunic and <a href="14343d.htm">surplice</a> with a black girdle, a white guimp and black veil; the cowl was black. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> wore a black tunic with a <a href="14343d.htm">surplice</a> and above it a hood and capuce; from the centre of the last, in front and behind, hung a small square of stuff known as the "Robert". In winter the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> wore an ample cloak without sleeves. The original habit was in both cases more simple.</p>

<h2 id="section2">The rule</h2>

<p>It appears <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> from the biography of Blessed Robert, which is known as the "Vita Andre&aelig;", that the Rule was written down during the founder's lifetime, probably in 1116 or 1117. This original Rule dealt with four points: silence, <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, food, and clothing, and contained the injunction that the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> should never be chosen from among those who had been brought up at Fontevrault, but that she should be one who had had experience of the world (de conversis sororibus). This latter injunction was observed only in the case of the first two abbesses and was abrogated by <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in 1201. We have three versions of the Fontevrist Rule (P.L., CLXII, 1079 sqq.), but it is clear that none of these is the original, though it is probable that the second version is a fragment or possibly a selection with additions by the first <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, Petronilla (for the argument see Walter, op. cit. infra, pp. 65-74). This Rule was merely a supplement to the <a href="02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> and there were no important variations from the latter in the ordinary conventual routine, though some additions were necessitated by the conditions of the "double" life. The rules for the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> enjoin the utmost simplicity in the materials of the habit, a strict observance of silence, abstinence from flesh meat even for the sick, and rigorous enclosure. The separation of the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> from the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> is carried to such a point that a sick <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a> must be brought into the church to receive the last <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The subjection of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> is very marked. They are men "who of their own <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a> have promised to serve the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> till death in the bonds of obedience, and that too with the reverence of due subjection. . . . They shall lead a common conventual life with no <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of their own, content with what the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> shall confer upon them." The very scraps from their table are to be "carried to the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns'</a> door and there given to the poor". A fugitive but penitent <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> "shall ask pardon of the <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> and through her regain the fellowship of the brethren." The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> cannot even receive a <a href="12319b.htm">postulant</a> without the permission of the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section3">History of the order</h2>

<p>At the death of <a href="13096a.htm">Robert d'Arbrissel</a>, in 1117, there are said to have been at Fontevrault alone 3000 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and in 1150 even 5000: the order was approved by Paschal II in 1112. The first <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, Petronilla of Chemill&eacute; (1115-1149), was succeeded by Matilda of Anjou, who ruled for five years. She was the daughter of Fulk, King of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of William, the eldest son of Henry I, of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The prosperity of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> continued under the next two abbesses, but by the end of the twelfth century, owing to the state of the country and the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> were reduced to gaining their livelihood by manual work. The situation was aggravated by internal dissensions which lasted a hundred years, and prosperity did not return till the beginning of the fourteenth century, under the rule of Eleanor of Brittany, grand-daughter of Henry III of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, who had taken the veil at the Fontevrist <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of Amesbury, in Wiltshire. The next <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> was Isabel of Valois, great-grandchild of St. Louis, but on her death there succeeded another period of trouble and decadence largely due to the disaffection of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who where discontented with their subordinate position. During the fifteenth century there were several attempts at reform, but these met with no success till the advent to power, in 1457, of Mary, sister of Francis II, Duke of Brittany. The order had suffered severely from the decay of religion, which was general about this time, as well as from the Hundred Years War. In the three <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a> of St-Aignan, Breuil, and Ste-Croix there were in all but five <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and one <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, where there had been 187 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and 17 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> at the beginning of the thirteenth century, and other houses were no better off. In 1459, a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> commission decided upon a mitigation of rules which could no longer be enforced, and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> were even allowed to leave the order on the simple permission of their <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a>. Dissatisfied with the mitigated life of Fontevrault, Mary of Brittany removed to the <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of La Madeleine-les-Orl&eacute;ans in 1471. Here she deputed a commission consisting of religious of various orders to draw up a definite Rule based on the Rules of Blessed Robert, St. Benedict, and <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, together with the Acts of Visitations. The resulting code was finally approved by <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> in 1475, and four years later it was made <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> upon the whole order. Mary of Brittany died in 1477, but her work was continued by her successors, Anne of Orl&eacute;ans, sister of Louis XII, and Ren&eacute;e de Bourbon. The latter may well be styled the greatest of the abbesses, both on account of the numbers of <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a> (28) in which she re-established discipline, and the victory which she gained over the rebellious religious at Fontevrault by the reform, enforced with royal assistance in 1502. The result was a great influx of <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a> of the highest rank, including several princesses of Valois and Bourbon. At Ren&eacute;e's death there were 160 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and 150 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> at Fontevrault. Under Louis de Bourbon (1534-1575), a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> of sincere but gloomy <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, the order suffered many losses at the hands of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who even besieged the great <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> itself, though without success; many <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> <a href="01624b.htm">apostatized</a>, but twelve more houses were reformed. Eleanor of Bourbon (1575-1611) saw the last of these troubles. She had great influence with <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>, and her affection for him was so great that, towards the end of her life, when he was assassinated, her <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> dared not tell her lest the shock should be too great.</p>

<p>The <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Louise de Bourbon de Lavedan, aided by the famous <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="08530c.htm">Ange de Joyeuse</a> and Joseph du Tremblay, sought to improve the status of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of St-Jean de l'Habit and made various attempts to establish <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for them. Her successor Jeanne-Baptiste de Bourbon, an <a href="07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> child of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> by the beautiful Charlotte des Essarts, has the credit of finally giving peace to the order. In 1641 she obtained royal letters confirming the reform and finally quashing the claims of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, who sought to organize themselves independently of the authority of the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>. The following year the Rule approved by <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> was printed at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The "Queen of Abbesses", Gabrielle de Rochechouart (1670-1704), sister of Mme. de Montespan and friend of <a href="09548b.htm">Mme. de Maintenon</a>, is said to have translated all the works of <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a> from the Latin version of Ficino. The <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was frequented by the children of the highest nobility, and her successors were entrusted with the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the daughters of Louis XV. The last <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, Julie Sophie Charlotte de Pardaillan d'Antin, was driven from her <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> by the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>; her fate is unknown. Towards the end of the eighteenth century there were 230 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and 60 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> at Fontevrault, and at the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> there were still 200 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, but the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were few in number and only formed a community at the mother-house. In the course of his preaching journeys through <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="13096a.htm">Robert d'Arbrissel</a> had founded a great number of houses, and during the succeeding centuries others were given to the order. In the seventeenth century the Fontevrist <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a> numbered about sixty in all and were divided into the four provinces of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, Brittany, Gascony, and Auvergne. The order never attained to any great importance outside <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> though there were a few houses in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The history of the order is, as will already have been seen, that of the mother-house. The Angevin kings were much attached to Fontevrault: Henry II and his queen, Eleanor of Guienne, <a href="13041b.htm">Richard Coeur de Lion</a>, and Isabel of <a href="01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a>, the wife of King John, were buried in the <em>Cimeti&egrave;re des Rois</em> in the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, where their effigies may still be seen. The remains were scattered at the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section4">The abbey buildings</h2>

<p>The Abbey of Fontevrault was in four parts: the Grand Moustier, or <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> and lazaretto of Saint-Lazare, the Madeleine for penitent <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, and, some distance apart, the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Jean de l'Habit for the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, destroyed at the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. The most notable buildings were naturally those belonging to the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> with the great minster dedicated to <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. This was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Pope <a href="03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, in 1119, but the church was probably rebuilt in the second half of the same century. It is a magnificent specimen of late Romanesque and consists of an aisleless <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> vaulted with six shallow <a href="04569d.htm">cupolas</a>, <a href="15018a.htm">transepts</a>, and an apsidal <a href="03572b.htm">chancel</a> with side <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>. In 1804 the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> became a central house of detention for 15,000 <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, and the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> of the church was cut up into four stories forming dormitories and refectories for the convicts, while the choir and <a href="15018a.htm">transepts</a> were walled up and used as their <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>. Five of the six <a href="04569d.htm">cupolas</a> were destroyed, but the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> has recently been cleared, and a complete restoration begun. The length of the church is 84 metres (about 276 ft.), the width of the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> 14m. 60 (about 48 ft.), and the height 21m. 45 (about 70 ft.). The interesting <a href="04060a.htm">cloisters</a> and <a href="03584a.htm">chapter-house</a> may be visited, but the magnificent refectory, dating from the twelfth and fifteenth centuries, is not shown.</p>

<h2 id="section5">English houses</h2>

<p>These were the Priories of Amesbury, in Wiltshire, and Nuneaton, in Warwickshire, and the Cell of Westwood, in Worcestershire, with six <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Amesbury had been an <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, but on account of their <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> lives the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> were dispersed by royal orders and the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> given to Fontevrault in 1177. The community was recruited from the highest ranks of <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> and in the thirteenth century numbered among its members several princesses of the royal house, among them Queen Eleanor of Provence, <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of Henry III. A survey of the English houses was taken in 1256, when there were 77 choir <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 7 <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and 16 conversi at Amesbury, and 86 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Nuneaton. In the fourteenth century the officials were appointed by the <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Fontevrault, but the bonds uniting the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="04340c.htm">nunneries</a> to the mother-house were gradually loosened until from alien they became denizen, that is to say, practically independent. In the last days some of the Prioresses of Amesbury seem to have resumed the ancient abbatial title; at the dissolution, in 1540, the house was surrendered by Joan Darrell and thirty-three <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. A Prior of Amesbury is mentioned in 1399, but it does not seem certain that there were at any time regular establishments of the Fontevrist <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section6">Modern development</h2>

<p>In 1803 Madame Rose, a Fontevrist <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a>, opened a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Chemill&eacute;, the home of the first <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, and three years later was enabled to buy a house and start community life; only temporary <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> were taken, and the constitutions were approved by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01489b.htm">Angers</a>. A few years later the habit of Fontevrault was resumed. Twelve more Fontrevists joined the community, and the ancient Rule was kept as far as possible. In 1847 permission was granted by the government to remove the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of Blessed Robert from Fontevrault to Chemill&eacute;, and by 1849 there were three houses of the revived congregation: Chemill&eacute; in the <a href="01489b.htm">Diocese of Angers</a>; Boulor in the <a href="02067c.htm">Diocese of Auch</a>; and Brioude in the Diocese of Puy. In this year a general chapter was held, in which certain modifications of the Rule were agreed upon: the many <a href="05789c.htm">fasts</a> were found ill adapted to the work of teaching; the houses were made subject to the ordinary; and the superioress elected only for three years. There are no Fontevrist <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>.</p>
