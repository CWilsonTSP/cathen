<p>The <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for the spiritual administration of the city, and its surrounding district, properly known as <em>Vicarius Urbis</em>.</p>

<h2>List of <em>vicarii</em></h2>

<p>A complete but uncritical list of the <em>vicarii in spiritualibus in urbe generales,</em> was published by Ponzetti (Rome, 1797); it was added to and improved by Moroni (Dizionario, XCIX). From the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Cancellieri in the Vatican Library new names were added by Crostarosa (Dei titoli della Chiesa romana, Rome, 1893). Eubel, by his own studies for the first volume of his "Hierarchia Catholica Medii &#198;vi", and with the aid of the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> notes of Garampi in the Vatican Archives, was enabled to present a new list substantially enlarged and improved (1200-1552). Many new discoveries of the undersigned have enabled him to draw up a critical list of the vicars and their representatives from 1100 to 1600. For the period before 1100 a fresh examination of all the original sources is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>; for the present all names previous to that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> must be held as uncertain. The first <em>vicarius in spiritualibus</em> clearly vouched for is Bovo (Bobo) <em>episcopus Tusculanus (Lavicanus)</em> about 1106 (Duchesne, Lib. Pont., II, 299 and 307, note 20; cf. also Jaff&eacute;, RR. PP. 12, 6069, 6106). Until 1260 the vicars were chosen from among the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; the first vicar taken from among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the vicinity of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Thomas Fusconi de Berta, <em>episcopus Senensis</em> (Moroni, Eubel). This custom continued until the secret consistory of 29 Nov., 1558, when <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> decreed that in the future the vicars should be chosen from among the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of episcopal dignity; it was then that arose the popular title of "cardinal-vicar", never used officially; the formal title is, and has always been, <em>Vicarius Urbis</em>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Nomination and oath</h2>

<p>It seems certain that in the twelfth century vicars were named only when the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> absented himself for a long time from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> or its neighbourhood. When he returned, the vicar's <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> ceased. This may have lasted to the pontificate of <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> (1243-54); on the other hand it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that in the latter half of this century the vicar continued to exercise the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office even during the presence of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Thus the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a vicar on 28 April, 1299, is dated from the Lateran. The office owes its full development to the removal of the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> to Southern <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and its final settlement at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Since then the list of vicars is continuous. The oldest commissions do not specify any period of duration; in the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 16 June, 1307, it is said for the first time that the office is held "at our good will". It is only in the sixteenth century that we meet with life-tenures; the exact year of this important modification remains yet to be fixed. Formerly the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> was by <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>; when began the custom of nominating by <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> is difficult to determine. The oldest <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> bears the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of 13 Feb., 1264 [Reg. Vat., tom. 28, fol. XC r, cap. XXXVIII (356); Guiraud, Les r&eacute;gistres d'Urbain IV, II, 359]. An immemorial custom of the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> demands that all its officials shall be duly sworn in, and this was the case with the vicars. In all probability during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries such <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a> were taken at the hands of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> himself. Later the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> fell to the <a href="01633b.htm">Apostolic Camera</a>. The <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>, whose text (though very much older) first appears in a document of 21 May, 1427 (Armar., 29, tom. 3, fol. 194 v, Vatican Archives), greatly resembles, in its first part, the usual episcopal <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> (Corp. Jur. Can., ed. Friedbe, II, 360; Tangl, Die p&#228;pstlichen Kanzleiordnungen von 1200-1500, p. 51); while the latter part applies to the office in question. The <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> is conceived in very general terms and lays but slight stress on the special <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the vicar. The official named on 18 Oct., 1412, as representative of the vicar was also sworn in, and before entering on his office was admonished to take, in presence of a specified <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, the usual <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and of a faithful exercise of the office.</p>

<h2>Authority</h2>

<p>According to the oldest known <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a>, 13 Feb., 1264, both Romans and foreigners were subject to the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the vicar. In this document, however, neither the special <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the vicar nor the local extent of his authority are made known, but it is understood that the territory in question is the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 27 June, 1288, the vicar received the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of "visitation, correction and reformation in spiritual matters .&hellip;. of dedicating churches and reconciling cemeteries, consecrating altars, blessing, confirming, and ordaining suitable <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> from the city" [Reg. Vat., tom. 44, fol. XCIIv, cap. XXVIIII (389); Langlois, Les r&eacute;gistres de Nicolas V, 595]. On 21 July, 1296 [Reg. Vat., tom. 48, fol. CLXXVIIr, cap. 85 (750); <a href="14565b.htm">Theiner</a>, Monumenta Slavoni&aelig; Meridionalis, I, 112; Potthast, Regesta, 24367; Faucon-Thomas, Les r&eacute;gistres de Boniface VIII, 1640)] <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> added the authority to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> and impose salutary penances. On 6 July, 1202 [Reg. Vat., tom. 50, fol. CCCLXXXVIr, cap. XLVII (250)] the following variant is met with: "to reform the churches, clergy, and people of Rome itself", and the additional right to do other things pertaining to the office of vicar. His <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> is first vouched for 16 June, 1207 (Reg. Clementis pap&aelig; V, ed. Bened. cap. 1645). The inclusion among these of <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, exempt and non-exempt and their inmates, without the walls of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was the first step in the local extension of the vicar's <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. He was also empowered to confer vacant <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> in the city. For a considerable length of time the above-mentioned <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> exhibit the fulness of the vicar's authority. Special commissions, however, multiply in this period, bearing with them in each case a special extension or new application of authority. Under <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> (1342-52) the territory of the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general's</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was notably increased by the inclusion of the suburbs and the rural district about <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Reg. Vat., tom. 142, fol. 152r, cap. VII, XXXI). Until the time of <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1740-58) this was the extent of the vicar's <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. By the "district of the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>" was understood a distance of forty Italian miles from the city walls. Since, however, the territory of the <a href="14324a.htm">suburbicarian sees</a> lay partially within these limits, the vicar came to exercise a <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> concurrent with that of the local <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and cumulatively. This was a source of frequent conflicts, until 21 Dec., 1744, when the local <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> was abolished by <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, in so far as their territory fell within the above-mentioned limits (Bangen, Die r&ouml;mische Curie, M&uuml;nster, 1854, 287).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> the vicar acquired not only the position and authority of a <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, but also that of a real <a href="11284b.htm">ordinary</a>, including all the authority of the latter office. This is quite evident from his acquired right of subdelegation whereby he was allowed to name a <em>vicegerens,</em> his representative not alone in pontifical ceremonies (as many maintain), but also in <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. For the rest, being already <em>delegatus a principe</em> he can canonically subdelegate (Bangen, op. cit., 288, note 2). By a Constitution of <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, 8 June, 1592, the vicar's right to hold a visitation ordinary and extraordinary of churches, <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the people (dating from 16 June, 1307) was withdrawn in favour of the <em>Congregatio Visitationis Apostolic&aelig;,</em> newly founded, for the current affairs of the ordinary visitation. Henceforth this <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> pertains to the <em>vicarius urbis</em> only in so far as he may be named president or member of this congregation, the prefect of which is the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> himself. The great "extraordinary" visitations, held generally at the beginning of each pontificate, are executed by a specially-appointed commission of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, the presidency of which falls by custom to the vicar. The Congregation of the Visitation is quite independent of the vicar, being constituted by Apostolic authority. The authority of the vicar does not cease with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> who appointed him. But should he die during a vacancy of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, his successor cannot be appointed by the <a href="03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>; all current affairs are transacted by the vicegerens who thus becomes a quasi <a href="15401c.htm">vicar-capitular</a>. Theoretically at least, the vicar may hold <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>; he could also formerly grant a number of choir-benefices. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> reserved this right in perpetuity to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>.</p>

<h2>The viceregens</h2>

<p>The first episcopal assistant of the vicar known is Angelus de Tineosis, <em>Episcopus Viterbiensis,</em> named 2 Oct., 1321, as assistant to the Vicar Andreas, <em>Episcopus Terracinensis</em>. His position is not so well outlined in the documents that we can form a clear <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>. It is significant that Angelus officiated as assistant even when the Vicar Andreas was in the city. On the other hand, the Vicar Franciscus Scaccani, <em>Episcopus Nolanus,</em> was allowed to choose an assistant for the business of the vicariate only in the case of his own absence from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Reg. Lateranense, tom. 68, fol. 83v, 19 Aug., 1399). According to this document it was not for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> but the vicar himself, though authorized thereto by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who chose his own assistant and gave over to him all his authority or faculties, in so far as they were based on law or custom. This shows that the <em>vicarius urbis</em> was firmly established in the fulness of his office and externally recognized as such; certain consuetudinary <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> had even at this <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> grown up and become accepted. We see from the Bullarium Magnum (II, 75) that on 18 Oct., 1412, <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> nominated Petrus Saccus, a canon of St. Peter's, as locum tenens of the Vicar Franciscus, <em>abbas monasterii S. Martini in Monte Cimino O. S. B.,</em> and himself conferred on this official all the faculties of the vicar. The new locum tenens was bidden to take the usual <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> before the Apostolic Camera (see above). A similar case is that (1430) of Lucas de Ilpernis, another canon of <a href="13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. When Petrus Accolti, Bishop-elect of <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, was named <em>vicarius urbis</em> (1505) he took over the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but the <em>pontificalia</em> or ceremonial <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> were given to Franciscus Berthleay, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mylopotamos, until the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Accolti. A similar case is that of Andreas Jacobazzi, a canon of St. Peter's, named vicar in 1519, but not <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09406a.htm">Lucera</a> until 1520; the <em>pontificalia</em> were committed to Vincentius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ottochaz-Zengg.</p>

<p>The series of assistants to the vicar, now known as <em>vices-gerentes,</em> begins with 1560. Until the time of <a href="04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (1700) they were named by the vicar; since then the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> has appointed them by a special <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>. The vicesgerens is therefore not a representative (locum tenens) of the vicar, but a subordinate <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> appointed for life, though removable at any time. His authority (faculties) relative to <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and orders is identical with that of the vicar; for its exercise, however, he depends on the latter, as is expressly stated in the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of his <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a>. In particular, the vicar has committed to him the administration of the treasury of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> known as the <em>Lisanotheca</em> or relic-treasury of the vicariate, the censorship of books, and the permission to print. The censorship of books was entrusted to the vicar by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 4 May, 1515 (in the Magnum Bullarium); this right, however, is now exercised by the vices-gerens subject to the <em>Magister sacri palati,</em> to whose imprimatur he adds his own name without further examination of the book in question. The really responsible censor is therefore the <em>Magister sacri palati,</em> not the vicesgerens. Occasionally there have been two assistants of the vicar, to one of whom were committed all matters of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, to the other the <em>pontificalia</em> and ordinations; the latter was known as suffragan of the vicar.</p>

<h2>Organization of the vicariate</h2>

<h3>Ordinations</h3>

<p>In this respect the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the vicar are of primary importance, since a multitude of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> from all parts of the world pursue their studies at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and receive orders there on presentation of the required authorization of their respective <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For every order conferred at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> there is a special examination conducted by a body of twenty-five learned <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> from the secular and the <a href="12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, which operates in sections of three. Orders are regularly conferred on the days prescribed by ecclesiastical law and in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, i.e. in the Lateran Church; they may, however, be conferred on other days and in other churches or <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>. They are usually conferred either by the vicar himself or by the vicesgerens; by special delegation from the vicar, however, another <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> may occasionally ordain candidates. For the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to ordain in their own churches (<em>tituli, diaconia</em>) see <a href="03333b.htm">C<font size=-2>ARDINAL</font></a>. By a general <a href="07789a.htm">pontifical indult</a> any <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> resident in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> may administer the Sacrament of Confirmation, it being still customary at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to confirm all children who seem in danger of death.</p>

<h3>Religious orders</h3>

<p>All matters concerning the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and their inmates pertain to a special commission in the vicariate composed of about eight members and under the direction of the vicar.</p>

<h3>Preaching</h3>

<p>Strict regulations of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> permit only those to preach in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> who have been found worthy after a thorough examination, scientific and practical, before a special commission which issues to each successful candidate the proper authorization. A similar regulation exists for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> desirous of hearing <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> in the city.</p>

<h3>Parochial clergy</h3>

<p>The <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> form a special corporation, under a <a href="03217a.htm">Camerlengo</a> chosen annually by themselves. Apart from the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> secured them by their <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>, in so far as approved by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, they are entirely subject to the vicar.</p>

<h3>Treasury of relics (Lipsanotheca)</h3>

<p>The administration of the large collection of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> preserved in that part of the <em>vicariato</em> (palace of the vicar) known as the Lipsanotheca, and whence <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> are regularly distributed to corporations, <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, or private <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, is confided by the vicar to his vicegerens. On the other hand the vicar himself is at all times the president of the pontifical Commission of Sacred Arch&aelig;ology (see <a href="01690a.htm">A<font size=-2>RCH&#198;OLOGY,</font> C<font size=-2>OMMISSION OF</font> S<font size=-2>ACRED</font></a>) which has charge of the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>; he cannot confide this <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to another.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3>Court</h3>

<p>Since the vicar is the ordinary judge of the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia Romana</a> (see <a href="13147a.htm">R<font size=-2>OMAN</font> C<font size=-2>URIA</font></a>) and its territory, it follows that he has always had and now has his own court, or tribunal. Formerly it took cognizance of both civil and criminal matters, either alone or concurrently with other tribunals, whether the case pertained to <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or to contentious <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. This court no longer deals with criminal cases, though it still exists for certain matters provided for in the ecclesiastical law, the details of which may be seen in any of the larger manuals of canon law. The principal officials of the court of the vicariate are the above-mentioned vicegerens, the <em>locum tenens civilia,</em> the <em>promotor fiscalis</em> for cases of <a href="02364b.htm">beatification and canonization</a>, the <em>promotor fiscalis</em> for other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, chiefly <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>. In former times the auditor of the vicariate was a very busy <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>, being called on to formulate or to decide the various processes brought before the vicar; today the office is mostly an honorary one. Matrimonial cases are dealt with by two officials who form a special section of the vicariate.</p>

<h3>Secretariate</h3>

<p>Among the minor officials of the vicar the most important are those who have charge of the secretariate, i.e. the secretary, his representative, two <em>minutanti</em> or clerks, and the aforesaid auditor of the vicar. The secretary is daily at his post and is authorized by subdelegation to decide or settle a number of minor matters of a regularly recurring nature; he also makes known the decisions of the vicar in more important matters; and is accessible to every one daily during a period of two hours. In view of a speedier administration corresponding to modern demands <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> has very much simplified the workings of the vicariate; some of its departments he suppressed, others he combined, so that now of its former fifteen sections and sub-sections only seven remain.</p>

<h2>1912 reorganization</h2>



<p>The organization of the Roman vicariate, as described above, rested largely on usage; it was not constructed as a compact whole at one single time. The most important ordinances respecting it were issued at various times during the course of the last two centuries, showing that for a long time the inadequacy of its organization, especially as regards the great length of time <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the settlement of matters brought before it, had been severely felt, more, however, by the subordinates of the vicariate than by its higher officials. It could not be said that its methods of business were in any way compatible with modern <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> as to efficient management. The lack of harmony was doubly evident after the entire central administration of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had been reformed by the Constitution "Sapienti Consilio", of 29 June, 1908. During the past various difficulties had stood in the way of a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate. Not the least of these was the lack of space in the former office of the vicariate. It was not until after the purchase of the Palazzo Mariscotti near San Francesco alle Stimmate, which was assigned to the cardinal vicar and his officials and arranged for their use, that <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> was able to carry out his long cherished plan for a thorough reform of the Roman vicariate.</p>

<p><a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> published his new ordinances respecting the administration of his Diocese of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the <a href="01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> "Etsi nos in", of 1 Jan., 1912, and the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> entered into force, as provided in it, on 15 Jan., 1912, the day it was <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the "Acta Apostolicae Sedis". Of the regulations for the period of transition, which were naturally <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in so thorough a reorganization, only one need be mentioned. This is that the former vicegerent (<em>vicesgerens</em>), whose office and title are in future to be suppressed, is permitted as a personal privilege to continue to bear the title as long as he is connected with any of the transactions of the vicariate.</p>

<p>The <em>Curia Urbis</em> or the Vicariate of the City of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> is now divided into four departments (<em>officia</em>), of which the second is again divided into four sections. The first department (<em>officium</em>) has under its care all the church services and the Apostolic visitation of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The second department watches over the behaviour of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> people. Judicial matters are settled in the third department, and the fourth department is devoted to the <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> administration of the entire vicariate. The head of all these bureaus is the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> who is the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His office and the extent of his power are always the same and are permanent, so that they do not cease even when the Papal See is vacant. This fact distinguishes the cardinal vicar as he is called, for the designation is not an official title, from all other vicars-general in the world, and gives him his peculiar legal position. In the same way it is a noticeable exception that the four departments can carry on their customary business, even when the vicar is not able to supervise what is done on account of the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> or of some other impediment. Even should the vicar die the work of the departments goes quietly on. Formerly this was not the case to so large a degree, as is shown by the deputation of 17 Dec., 1876, on the death of Cardinal Vicar Patrizi (<a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> record of the vicariate, "Diverse deputazioni del vicario dall' anno 1759", p. 290).</p>

<p>The head of the first department is a commissary, of the second an assessor, of the third an auditor, and of the fourth a prefect. Their respective rank follows the order given above. Among the offices mentioned in the former article those of the vicegerent (<em>vicesgerens</em>), the locum tenens, the secretary, and the auditor in the earlier form were abolished. None of the four new presiding officers of the departments is permitted under any pretext whatever to interfere in the affairs of another, except in purely internal matters of administration.</p>

<h3>First Department</h3>

<p>At present the <a href="15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> of the Diocese of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> is in the hands of a commission of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The president of the commission is the vicar, and its members by virtue of their office are prefects of the Congregation of the Council and of Religious Orders. The secretary of this official board is the commissary just mentioned. The first appointee as secretary and commissary was the former vicegerent (<em>vicesgerens</em>). The archives and compendiums of abstracts of the former Congregation of the Apostolic Visitation, which has been suppressed since 1908, belong to the new commission. Every five years, the next falling in 1916, a <a href="15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> is to be held without any express <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> command being issued before the visitation. Six paragraphs (12-17) regulate the details of the procedure to be observed in the visitation.</p>

<p>The treasury of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> (<em>lipsanotheca</em>), the archaeological commission, and the committee on <a href="10648a.htm">church music</a> are included in this department and are under the supervision of the vicar. A commission on ecclesiastical art has been established; its competence includes the erection of churches, their maintenance, restoration, and adornment. The first department is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to keep an exact list of all the churches in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in one of which is noted the object and peculiarities of each church.</p>

<h3>Second Department</h3>

<p>The second department has four sections, the head of each of which is a secretary: the first section has to do with the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the second, with the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>; the third, with the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, colleges, and other institutions for <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in the city; the fourth, with the brotherhoods, unions, and social <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>. All four sections are subordinate first to the vicar and next to the assessor. The powers of the first section are laid down in twelve ordinances, the details of which cannot here be entered into. Mention should, however, be made of the stringent rule that no <a href="04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, regardless of whether he belongs to the Roman <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> or to another diocese, can be called to an office or a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> by anyone, even a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, unless it has been previously established by a secret letter to the vicar that the vicariate has no objection to his appointment. This regulation puts an end finally to an old abuse of historic growth which in past times led to much that was disadvantageous.</p>

<p>This department has to keep a register of all members of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the city, giving the name, age, residence, kind of employment, and other personal notes. The vicar is aided in the settlement of all matters regarding the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> by the examiners of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in the settlement of questions as to the transfer or deposition of <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> by the consultors, in all questions as to offices and <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> by the general supervisory council, the deputies for the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and the advisory council (<em>commissio directiva</em>). Detailed regulations are given as to the examiners of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in paragraph 30, a to i. The second section of this department is charged with the supreme direction and supervision of the numerous <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>; the details are regulated in seven paragraphs. Paragraphs 38-46 are concerned with the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, colleges, and other <a href="13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>. The care of these is the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of the third section. Its secretary must keep an exact list of all such institutions, of their teachers and principals, and exact statistics respecting the pupils. He must attend the meetings of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> board, keep its minutes, and must execute all the orders of the vicar or the supervisory council respecting these institutions. Paragraphs 47-57 regulate in detail the work of the fourth section, which has under its charge the brotherhoods, unions, and social <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>. It consists of a council of six members with a secretary of its own.</p>

<h3>Third Department</h3>

<p>All previously existing judicial bodies are suppressed and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> has made the vicar the ordinary and sole judge in the first instance for all suits brought in the court of the Roman diocese. The vicar passes judgement only in those cases which he has expressly reserved for himself; in other cases his auditor acts as judge, forming with the vicar one and the same court. The auditor is regarded as the official of the curia of the Roman Diocese and tries the suits according to <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a>. The office and <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the camerlengo of the Roman <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> have been suppressed and his faculties and <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> have been transferred completely to the auditor, who is provided with a substitute. When according to <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> a suit is to be decided not by a single judge but by a full bench, the auditor is then held to be the presiding judge, in case the vicar does not reserve the position of presiding officer to himself. The appointment of the associate judges belongs to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; for the individual case the vicar has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to select the associate judges from those appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. This ordinance is especially worth noticing. The other ordinances cannot here be discussed in detail.</p>

<h3>Fourth Department</h3>

<p>The fourth department is directed by a prefect. It has charge of all the purely administrative affairs of the vicariate, its principal work being the care of finances; it has also charge of the purchase of supplies, as the formularies, supplies for the chancellery, etc. The organization effected offers nothing that requires any particular comment. The head of the department is called a prefect.</p>

<h3>Order of business of the vicariate</h3>

<p>The <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> changes being made, the essential ordinances of the Constitution "Sapienti consilio" and the enacting ordinances afterwards issued for the congregations and curial authorities in regard to the manner in which business should be transacted also apply to the vicariate. It should be observed that a secret and a public archive have been established for the vicariate. The vicar is to submit to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> for approval the rules respecting office hours and holidays. Of much importance is the closing formula of the Constitution which was drawn up in accordance with the new formulary of the Apostolic Chancellery. After the formulary has been tested for a time by practice it is to be published. It says: "Decernentes praesentes litteras firmas, validas et efficaces semper esse et fore, suosque plenarios et integros effectus sortiri et obtinere a die promulgationis in Commentario de Apostolicae Sedis actis".</p>

<p>A comparison with the earlier article shows that the reconstruction of the <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate</a> is not an organic continuation of the former condition but that an entirely new organization has been created. There is in this change an evident effort to organize the official bodies as servants of the public and to do this on the basis of the modern method of carrying on business, as it is found everywhere in countries that lead in civilization and in well-organized central boards of authorities. Formerly the administration was a cumbrous one, impeded by traditional obstacles; it may perhaps be said to have regarded itself as the primary object and the public which it should serve as of subordinate consideration. This state of things is now past, thanks to the energy of the reigning <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, which overcame all obstacles. Now, anyone who has business with the vicariate knows exactly to which department, which official, he must go in order to have the matter in question speedily settled. It is to be expected that in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> the third department owing to the test of practical working may undergo slight changes, as it is not probable that all ordinances will prove capable of permanent execution. The characteristics of the new organization are division of work and rigid separation of the judiciary from the executive administration, together with an ample supply of officials for the different departments. In the reorganization customs that had become historical were taken into consideration only in so far as they could be combined without difficulty with modern methods of business.</p>

<p>To inspire greater confidence in the newly-created offices of the vicariate, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, in May, 1912, appointed a superior board of control, composed of three <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, whose <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to supervise the business affairs of the vicariate. Cardinals Lugari, Pompilj, and Van Rossum were the first to be named for this important and influential board. These nominations of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> were received by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with unanimous expressions of good will and gratification.</p>
