<p>(QUEBECENSIS)</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of Quebec, in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, comprises the counties of Beauce, Bellechasse, Dorchester, Kamouraska, Levis, L'Islet, Lotbiniere, Megantic, Montmagny, part of Temiscouata, Montmorency, Portneuf, and Quebec. The early missionaries, the R&eacute;collets (1615-29) and the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1625), depended directly on the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> having returned alone in 1632, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> extended his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the country. According to the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of erection (1674), the See of Quebec comprehended all the possessions of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in North America: Newfoundland, Cape Breton, <a href="01090a.htm">Acadia</a>, Ile St. Jean, all <a href="12598a.htm">New France</a> from the Atlantic to the plains of the far West, the valley of the Mississippi and Louisiana, a territory much larger than <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. After the treaty of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1783), the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec kept Newfoundland and what now forms the <a href="03227a.htm">Dominion of Canada</a>. That immense <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was successively diminished by the erection of new sees until by the formation of <a href="03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a> (1878) it was reduced to its present boundaries (see <a href="03231a.htm">CATHOLICITY IN CANADA</a>).</p>

<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>(l) Fran&ccedil;ois de Montmorency Laval, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (1658) <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Petr&aelig;a and <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="12598a.htm">New France</a>, landed at Quebec (1659) and, having happily overcome the pretensions of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, set about the organization of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. His first report to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (1660) states that there were only twenty-six <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom sixteen were <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; eight churches or <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> in Quebec and the neighbourhood, with three others in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, and Tadoussac; about 2000 inhabitants. No house, no revenue for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, no <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and no income for churches. Two orders of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> applied themselves to the instruction of girls: the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> (founded in 1639 by Venerable Marie de l'Incarnation, and the Congregation of Notre Dame founded by Ven. Marguerite Bourgeoys (1659) and granted <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> by Bishop Laval in 1669 and 1676. The <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of La Fl&ecirc;che kept the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> established in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1642) by <a href="09584a.htm">Jeanne Mance</a>, and the Quebec H&ocirc;tel-Dieu (1639) was entrusted to the <a href="07281a.htm">Order of St. Augustine</a>, the Sisters of the Mercy of Jesus. Bishop Laval founded the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec (1663), which became a lower <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in 1668, but had no classes before the Conquest. The pupils attended the lectures of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> opened in 1635, and where, on the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> request, classes in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> were soon added to philosophy. For its maintenance the institution was granted the <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> established in 1663; <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were to be served by its members; what remained of <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> was devoted to the building of churches and priests' houses. The first <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> erected was that of Quebec (1664) which, suppressed by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of erection of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was reestablished by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1684 and united to the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>; he also instituted a chapter. The <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Quebec, begun in 1647, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1666 by the <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, became and remains the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Eleven other <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were erected in 1678. In 1683 eighteen <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> did <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> work along the St. Lawrence. The <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, with Our Lady of Bon-Secours, was united to the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> (1678). In Acadia, Port-Royal was served by the Abb&eacute; Petit, sent in 1676, and the Abb&eacute; Thury founded the Pentagoet mission in 1684. There were numerous <a href="10378a.htm">Indian missions</a>, some residential, some among wandering tribes, almost all in the hands of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Bishop Laval, in spite of material obstacles, faithfully visited his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> and confirmed nearly 5000. The population (1683) was 10,278 in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 600 Acadians, and 1512 converted Indians. The census of 1686 states that there were 44 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 12 students in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, 43 <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, 12 R&eacute;collets (returned in 1670), 28 <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, 26 <a href="07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of the Mercy of Jesus, 16 <a href="07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of St. Joseph, and 13 Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame.</p>

<p>(2) Jean-Baptiste de la Croix Chevri&egrave;re de St. Vallier, b. 1653; d. 1727, visited <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> as <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of Bishop Laval (1685-6) and became his successor in 1688. A yearly grant of eight thousand francs from the king enabled him to increase the number of <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from twenty to thirty-six. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were entrusted with the mission of the Illinois (1690) and other Indians of that region; the R&eacute;collets, with the Royal Island (Cape Breton), and the Seminary of Quebec with Acadia and the mission of the Tamarois on the left shore of the Mississippi, which it kept until after the Conquest. Two of its members, the Abb&eacute;ss St. Cosme and Foucault, fell victims there to their <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Parishes were rendered independent of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1692). For the improvement of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> in the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of church discipline, ecclesiastical conferences were organized (1700), four <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> held, and a ritual with a <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a> published. The General Hospital of Quebec was founded (1693), also the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> (1697) which was in the meantime a <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> and a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. He approved (1688) the Charron Brothers, founders of the General Hospital of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1694). They were <a href="07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> and schoolmasters and, until their extinction, half a century later, kept <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, and a few other places. Instruction was more common at that epoch than is generally admitted by historians. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> early established primary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, teachers went about from place to place, and mostly all <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were school-masters. Though a most charitable man, he was not amiable. He had hurt the feelings of many, chiefly in the separation of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> from the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1692), and complaints had reached <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. His resignation was called for by the king and, upon his refusal, he was retained in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> several years (1694-7), and again from 1709 to 1713, after having been five years a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> (1704-9). During that voyage he had gone to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and obtained the canonical union to the See of Quebec, chapter, and <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Maubec, Lestr&eacute;es, and Benevent, granted by the king to Bishop Laval.</p>

<p>(3) Louis-Fran&ccedil;ois Duplessis de Mornay, b. 1663; d. 1741, coadjutor of Bishop St. Vallier (1713), and his successor (1727-33). He never went to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, sending, to administer in his stead, his coadjutor, <a href="05137a.htm">Bishop Dosquet</a>.</p>

<p>(4) <a href="05137a.htm">Pierre-Herman Dosquet</a>, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (1725) <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13421c.htm">Samos</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1733 to 1739. His chief acts were the establishment of the sisters of the congregation of Notre Dame at Louisburg (1735) and the resignation to the king of the abbey of Benevent, more a burden than a source of revenue for the Quebec <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. A yearly allowance of nine thousand francs was granted in return. He resigned his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> in 1739, and received the abbey of Breine with an income of six thousand francs.</p>

<p>(5) Fran&ccedil;ois-Louis Pourroy de L'Auberivi&egrave;re, b. 1711; d. 1740, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1739) by Bishop Mornay, unfortunately died a few days after landing at Quebec.</p>

<p>(6) Henri-Marie de Pontbriand, b. 1708; d. 1760, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1741). A man of great <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, most devoted to his pastoral <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, he visited several times his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, even the distant missions of the Presentation (Ogdensburg) and Detroit, occasionally taught <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and established yearly retreats for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. The new order of <a href="07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a>, recently founded in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> by <a href="15736c.htm">Madame D'Youville</a> and entrusted with the General Hospital, received his encouragement and approval (1755). He aided the victims of the plague in 1746, 1757, and 1758, enabled the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> to rebuild their <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, destroyed by fire (1752), and retrieved a similar disaster fallen upon the Quebec H&ocirc;tel-Dieu (1755). In his pastoral letters, he exhorted the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to grant to the king for his <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> a part of their <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> and encouraged <a href="03227a.htm">Canadians</a> to do their <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to their country, recalling the fate of the Acadians in 1755. During the siege of Quebec, broken in health by work and cares, he retired to a nearby <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> and could see after the surrender, his palace and the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, the churches of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the Recollects greatly damaged by bullets and shells, half of the city houses, the church of the Lower-Town and the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which he had recently (1744-9) rebuilt on a larger scale, entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>(7) Jean-Olivier Briand (q.v;), <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1766 to 1784. One of the vicars-general charged with the administration of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> during the vacancy, he ruled the district of Quebec. The <a href="03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, by two delegates, and the chapter, by an address, had entreated the King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to maintain the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. More successful than the Abb&eacute; Montgolfier, rejected by <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, the Abb&eacute; Briand, elected by the chapter in his place, was indirectly notified that the Government would not oppose his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, which took place in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1766); He had to thwart the intentions of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> of anglicizing her new subjects in <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and language. Circumstances besides seemed most unfavourable. The population, 42,000 in 1739, was in 1760, 60,000; of 181 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> only 138 remained. The Recollects and <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were forbidden to receive <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>; The chapter, prevented from filling its vacancies, soon died. Canonically notified &#151; or not (it may be <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a>) &#151; of the suppression of their order, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were left, until the death of the last, <a href="03402c.htm">Father Casot</a> (1800), in peaceful possession of their estates, which were afterwards forfeited to the Crown. In Louisiana they had been all banished after 1763, with the exception of Father Meurin, and their several <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> among the Illinois destroyed, while the properties of the mission of the Tamarois were sold for a farthing by the Abb&eacute; Forget-Duverger, the last <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> sent by the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The Recollects disappeared one by one, Father Berey, the superior, who received an annuity of 500, dying in 1800, and the last <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the order, in 1813. The college of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> having been changed into military stores and barracks, the hope of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> rested upon the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec, where classes opened in 1765. The loyalty of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> during the American War of Independence greatly contributed to obtain religious liberty for <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. He could write in 1775: "Religion is perfectly free. I can exercise my ministry without any restriction." As a <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that he united firmness with the respect of <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, it may be remembered that he refused to take the Test Oath, until the formula was made acceptable to a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and once said to General Murray: "My head shall be cut off before allowing you to appoint <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to any <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>." The Government granted him an annuity of 250 besides 150 for the episcopal palace that he had rebuilt and rented for public use. With three thousand francs voted by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in 1765, it formed nearly all his revenue. Nevertheless, he found means for frequent and abundant charities. The number of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> was about one hundred, more than twenty-five having been erected since the Conquest. A pastoral letter of 1777 contains interesting statistics: 46,323 births and 24,731 burials from 1759 to 1769, and 43,995 births with 26,127 burials from 1769 to 1777, giving a net increase of 39,460 for the whole period between 1759 and 1777. From 1767 Bishop Briand regularly visited his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> ninety <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. Having been allowed by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for fear of a vacancy, to choose and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a coadjutor with future succession, he <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1772 the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Doryln and gave him authority in 1784.</p>

<p>(8) <a href="05538a.htm">Louis-Philippe Mariauchau D'Esglis</a> was the first Quebec <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> born in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. He was <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Saint-Pierre-d'Orl&eacute;ans and kept until his death his small <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>. According to the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> annals, in 1782 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were very scarce and several <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> without <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>. Vacancies were quickly filled, whereas, in 1788-90, the number of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> being 121, the census of 1790 numbers 146 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 142 were in office. Returning Acadians settled in several of the maritime provinces and were served by <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> Bourg and the Fathers Girouard, Le Roux, and Donat, of the congregation of the Holy Ghost, while the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Scotch <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the same region were attended by the Abb&eacute;ss Phelan and Jones, who resided at <a href="07117b.htm">Halifax</a>.</p>

<p>(9) Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Hubert, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Almire and coadjutor of Quebec (1786), filled the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> from 1788 to 1797. Every year he spent three months visiting the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities and a part of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1795 he visited Baie-des-Chaleurs. He <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> 53 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and confirmed 45,148 people. The number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, in 1794, was 160 for a population of 160,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. During the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, 34 came from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Nine were sent to Acadia and four to Upper <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, on the verge of ruin, obtained recruits, and kept possession of its estates, which, thanks to the firmness of Bishops Plessis and Panet, were declared, under Queen Victoria, its lawful <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. Bishop Hubert, to please Lord Dorchester, appointed coadjutor the Abb&eacute; Bailly de Messein, <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Pointe-aux-Trembles (Portneuf co.), <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03314b.htm">Capsa</a> in 1789. A distinguished man in some regards, successful missionary in Acadia (1767- 71), professor of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1772-7), and afterwards (1778-82) private teacher of the governor's children, he favoured the establishment of the mixed <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> contemplated by some New England loyalists settled in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and which Bishop Hubert considered and firmly opposed as an anti-Catholic agency. The coadjutor died in 1794, apologizing for his <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>. Another and different coadjutor was chosen, Pierre Denault, to whom Bishop Hubert resigned his authority in 1797.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>(10) Pierre Denault (q.v.) was <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Longueuil and kept his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> even after his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Canathe (1795). The <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Lower <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> numbered then about one hundred and forty, some of which he visited every year. He also visited Upper <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1801 and 1802, and created, for English-speaking <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of St. Andrew and St. Raphael, which he entrusted to Rev. Alex. McDonell. On his visit to the maritime provinces in 1803, he confirmed 8800 people. The primary <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> founded by Abb&eacute; Brassard at <a href="11069a.htm">Nicolet</a> he made a classical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> (1803), now the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="11069a.htm">Nicolet</a>. His generous contributions to the new college of the <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> (1804-5) also show his devotion to <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>.</p>

<p>(11) Joseph-Octave Plessis (q.v.), <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Canathe in 1801, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec from 1806 to 1825. His great achievement was the organization of the <a href="03231a.htm">Church in Canada</a> in which he was providentially aided by the American invasion of 1812-13. After the treaty of <a href="06542c.htm">Ghent</a> (1814) he was for the first time officially acknowledged as <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, and granted by the king an annuity of 1000. He obtained from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, besides the erection of the Vicariate Apostolic of Nova Scotia (1817), the appointment of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for Upper <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, New Brunswick, including Prince Edward's and the Magdalen Islands, and for the North-West, where the Abb&eacute;ss Provencher and Dumoulin had begun (1818) the mission of the Red River. <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> assented, but on the express condition that these <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> would be only auxiliaries and vicars-general of Quebec. He also obtained from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> not to use, while the Government objected, the title of <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> granted to him in 1819. All the new <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> were <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by him on his return: McDonell (1820), McEachern and Lartigue (1821), Provencher (1822). He <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> 114 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, preserved the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="11069a.htm">Nicolet</a>, and encouraged <a href="07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a> College, begun by Abb&eacute; Girouard (1811). Like his predecessors, he firmly opposed the royal institution which placed <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> hands, and endeavoured to obtain <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. A more favourable law was voted in 1824. As a member of the Legislative Council from 1817, he had great influence. In 1822 he contributed to prevent the union of the Canadas intended by the English House of Commons.</p>

<p>(12) Bernard-Claude Panet, b. 1753; d. 1833, <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Rivi&egrave;re-Ouelle, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saldes and coadjutor of Quebec (1807), was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1825 to 1833. The chief events of his administration were: the building of <a href="11069a.htm">Nicolet</a> College (1827), to which he contributed the sum, large for the time, of $32,000; the foundation of the College of Ste-Anne-de-la-Pocati&egrave;re (1827) by the Abb&eacute; Painchaud; the <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> law of 1829 which granted allowances for the creation of <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and the maintenance of colleges, <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, and academies already in existence; the erection in Quebec, with his help, of St. Patrick's church for the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>; the sale to the Government of the episcopal palace built by Mgr Briand. An annual rent of 1000 was paid, which, although irredeemable, was redeemed in 1888 by the sum of $74,074, given to <a href="14462b.htm">Cardinal Taschereau</a>.</p>

<p>(13) Joseph Signay, b. 1778; d. 1850, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fussala and coadjutor of Quebec (1827), administrator (1832), <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1833), <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from 1844 to 1850. There were epidemics of cholera in 1832, 1834, and 1849. Quebec was almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1845. In 1847 typhus visited the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> exiles at Grosse-Ile. Among many <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> deserving grateful memory must be mentioned the <a href="03470b.htm">Abb&eacute; F&eacute;lix Cazeau</a>, then secretary to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and afterwards <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, who found homes for nearly five hundred <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a>. Important events were: the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> on <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> (1841) which allowed the election of <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> commissioners having power to build new <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, to choose teachers and raise funds therefor; the erection of Quebec (1844) into a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolis</a> with three suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>, <a href="08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and Toronto; the Oblates (1844) and the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1849) admitted into the diocese and charged respectively with the Saguenay mission and the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin of the Upper-Town; <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> for the Propagation of the Faith (1837), colonization (1838), and temperance (1843). The report of Bishop Signay to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1843 states that the diocese contained 200,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 145 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 4 orders of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and 3 colleges or <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. ln the Red River mission, under Bishop Provencher, out of 5140 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, more than 2700 were <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="02593a.htm">Vicar-General Norbert Blanchet</a> and <a href="04706a.htm">Modeste Demers</a> had opened (1838) the mission of <a href="02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, while other missionaries worked among the Indians of Lake Abbittibi. Bishop Signay was the last to receive the annuity of 1000 granted to Mgr Plessis. In 1847 he entered the present episcopal palace.</p>

<p>(14) Pierre-Flavien Turgeon, b. 1787; d. 1867, elected in 1831 and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1834 <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sydime and coadjutor of Quebec, became administrator in 1849, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1850. That same year a meeting of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> prepared the first Council of Quebec, held in 1851 under his presidency. After directions on liturgy and discipline, against social and <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> dangers, its most important <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> is that on <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> and normal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, which gave birth (1852) to <a href="09047b.htm">Laval University</a> and to Laval Normal School in 1857. <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> was also petitioned to form new <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>. <a href="07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a> and <a href="14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> were erected in 1852, while Halifax became a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. A second council took place at Quebec in 1854. The foundation of the Quebec Sisters of Charity (1849) and of the Good Shepherd (1850), the reorganization of ecclesiastical conferences the publication of a new <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a> and the approval of Butler's for English-speaking <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are the chief acts of Bishop Turgeon's administration. In 1855, owing to ill-health, he left the administration of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> to his coadjutor.</p>

<p>(15) <a href="02206b.htm">Charles-Fran&ccedil;ois Baillargeon</a>, as <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Quebec (1831-50), procured for his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> the <a href="08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, and established the conferences of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. As <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the great events of his administration were the third (1863) and fourth (1868) Councils of Quebec, attended by the suffragan Bishops of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, St. Boniface, <a href="14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, <a href="07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a>, <a href="07123a.htm">Hamilton</a>, Sandwich (now London), <a href="08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, <a href="14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, and (in 1868) Rimouski. Besides several disciplinary decrees, the erection of the ecclesiastical provinces of <a href="14781d.htm">Toronto</a> and St. Boniface was decided and a petition was added for the <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Sister Marie de l'Incarnation, foundress of the Quebec <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. <a href="02206b.htm">Bishop Baillargeon</a> attended the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (1869), but was forced by ill-health to return before voting for <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, which he favoured. He died soon after. He had <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> five <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> one hundred and ninety <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>

<p>(16) <a href="14462b.htm">Elzear-Alexandre Taschereau</a>, b. 1820; d. 1898, for several years teacher of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and was one of the founders of <a href="09047b.htm">Laval University</a>; he was <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> (1800-6), and again, in 1869, <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (1862), <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of <a href="02206b.htm">Archbishop Baillargeon</a> at the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, administrator (1870), <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (1871), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of the title of Santa Maria della Vittoria (1886). Among the many facts of his administration may be quoted: the foundation of the Hospital of the Sacred Heart, which he entrusted to the Sisters of the General Hospital (1873); the erection of the Chicoutimi college and see (1878); the inauguration of a classical course of studies in the Commercial College of Levis (1879); the creation of more than fifty <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> with the funds of colonization and of the Propagation of the Faith, kept since 1876 for local wants; the foundation (1892) of the now prosperous order of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, by the Abb&eacute; Brousseau; the fifth (1873), sixth (1878), and seventh (1886) Councils of Quebec. Among the decrees must be mentioned that on the improvement of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies after <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> principles, according to <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII's</a> direction. <a href="14462b.htm">Archbishop Taschereau</a> had to deal with some perplexing cases: he was <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate for the division of Notre Dame <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1871), and the conclusion of his report was adopted by Cardinal Barnabo. In the exciting question of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, his pastoral letters of 1875 and 1877 procured for the country a lasting peace. Another cause of discord was the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> question, finally settled by establishing at <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1876) a branch of Laval, which, by the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Jamdudum" (1896), has become nearly independent. In 1888 the long pending debate on the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits'</a> estates ended by an agreement between <a href="10198a.htm">Prime Minister Mercier</a> and Father Turgeon, S.J., authorized by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Government paid an indemnity of $400,000 to be divided among the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="09047b.htm">Laval University</a>, and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> purposes. A share of $60,000 was granted to the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Board of Education. When <a href="14462b.htm">Cardinal Taschereau</a> handed over the administration to his coadjutor (1894), the archdiocese contained 320,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 392 <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 33 <a href="12722c.htm">regulars</a>, 3 colleges or <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 65 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, 195 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 192 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and missions, although more than 50 had been cut off for the new sees of <a href="13058a.htm">Rimouski</a> and <a href="03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a>.</p>

<p>(17) Louis Nazaire Begin, b. 1840, after several years of studies in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1865, filled in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec the successive positions of professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, director of students, and prefect of studies. Principal of the Laval Normal School (1884), <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03658a.htm">Chicoutimi</a> (1888), coadjutor of Quebec (1891) with the title of <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04591b.htm">Cyrene</a>, granted future succession (1892), he took possession of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> in 1898. He has written books on <a href="07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, the <a href="05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, and the veneration of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. During his administration the <a href="01694b.htm">archdiocese</a> has greatly developed by the admission of several orders of men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, and by the creation of many new <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. He played a leading part in the struggle of the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (1896) against the <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> law of 1890, by which the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Manitoba had been deprived of their <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. After the delegation of Mgr. Merry del Val, now Secretary of State to <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, he received (1898) the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> letter "Affari vos" (1897), in which <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, while he praised the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for their vindication of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, advised union and charity when claiming <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. On the tercentenary of the foundation of Quebec (1908) a monument was erected to Bishop Laval. Important events are: the organization of the "Action sociale catholique", a branch of which is the paper "L'Action Sociale", edited at Quebec since 1907; the first Plenary Council of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> (1909), attended, under the presidency of Archbishop Sbaretti, <a href="12456a.htm">delegate Apostolic</a>, by 7 <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 26 <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 1 <a href="12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, 1 mitred <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and 5 episcopal proxies. At this date (April, 1911), the decrees have not yet been published. Mgr Paul-Eugene Roy, b. 1859, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> in 1908. His classical course was made in Quebec; after taking in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the degree of licentiate in letters, he was professor of rhetoric and prefect of studies in the Quebec <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, became <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadians</a> at <a href="07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, Conn., and in 1901 was first <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Jacques-Cartier in Quebec. He is the chief force in the "Action Sociale".</p>

<h2>Organization</h2>

<p>The Archdiocese of Quebec is incorporated under the title "La Corporation Episcopale Catholique Romaine de Qu&eacute;bec" by XII Victoria, ch. 36, which also grants (&#167; 7) incorporation to all <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> then existing or to be afterwards erected in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. "L'Ev&ecirc;que catholique de Qu&eacute;bec" was personally, and remains, incorporated by letters patent of Queen Victoria in 1845. Parishes receive civil incorporation after canonical erection, but possess their legal <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> even without it. <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a>, administered under the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor's</a> presidency by church-wardens elected by parishioners, cannot be legally alienated without the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> assent. In the <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Quebec, a mutual insurance, with its seat in Quebec, covers risks on church buildings and parsonages to the amount of $7,500,000. A similar insurance exists for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> or <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. The <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Quebec is the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Begun in 1647, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Bishop Laval in 1666, rebuilt on a larger scale by Bishop Pontbriand (1744-9) and again, after the siege by Bishop Briand (1767-71), it was <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> in 1874 by the title of basilica. With the exception of a few students, sent every year to <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> to receive a training as professors, most of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> are <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in the higher <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec. None is admitted until after satisfactory classical studies and two years of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The course of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> lasts four years. Four times a year all <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in office have to meet by groups of ten and twelve to treat of questions of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> or <a href="07365a.htm">church history</a> determined by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to whom report must be sent. Two retreats every year are preached in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, so that all the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> may attend one or the other. An <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> association ("La Caisse St. Joseph") grants a pension to its members out of office through sickness or old age.</p>

<h2>Charities</h2>

<p>Two <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> (H&ocirc;tel-Dieu) for the sick; 12 for old <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of both sexes; 7 <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a>; 3 patronages for foundlings; 1 refuge for repentant girls &#151; all entrusted to <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; several prosperous <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> or conferences of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>; a Tabernacle Society and an Association for the Protection of Maid Servants.</p>
