<p>Georgetown University, <a href="15558a.htm">Washington, District of Columbia</a>, "is the oldest <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literary establishment in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. It was founded immediately after the Revolutionary War, by the incorporated <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Clergy of <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, who selected from their Body Trustees, and invested them with full power to choose a President and appoint Professors. Since the year 1805, it has been under the direction of <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>" (The Laity's Directory, 1822).</p>

<h2>Origin and founder</h2>

<p>In treating of the origin of Geogetown University, its chronicles and historians are wont to refer to earlier <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, projected or carried on by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that Father Ferdinand Poulton, a few years after the settlement of St. Mary's, wrote to the general of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> about the prospects of founding a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> in the infant colony; and the general answered, in 1640: "The hope held out of a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> I am <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> to entertain; and, when it shall have matured, I will not be backward in extending my approval". But the times were not favourable. The <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> against <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and educators were so stringent during the greater part of the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> colonial period that it was only at intervals, for brief spaces of time, and by stealth, that the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, always solicitous for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, were able to conduct a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. Such a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was at <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, in Cecil County; it numbered among its scholars John Carroll, the founder of Georgetown College. He is the link, moral and personal, between Georgetown and earlier <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>; and with his name the history of Georgetown College is indissolubly connected. He had a large share in its foundation and upbringing, and the sons of Georgetown, to <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> his memory, have formally instituted the observance of "Founder's Day", in January of each year. Even before he became the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, he saw and impressed upon his former brethren of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> the urgent need of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> College. Having secured their cooperation, he drew up the plan of the institution and issued a prospectus appealing to his friends in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> for financial assistance. It was he who selected the site; and--although unable to give personal supervision to the undertaking, burdened as he was with the solicitude of all the churches--he watched with paternal interest over the early growth of the college. Georgetown still possesses his portrait, by Gilbert Stuart, relics from his birthplace at Upper Marlborough, the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of his course in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> which he used when a rural missionary at Rock Creek, the attestation of his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Lulworth Castle, the circular which he issued detailing the plan and scope of the college, and many letters, original or copied, relating to its standing and prospects.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1889 the college celebrated with befitting pomp the hundredth anniversary of its foundation. Georgetown, in 1789, was the chief borough of Montgomery County, <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. Father Carroll selected it for the site of the academy, influenced, no doubt, by a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the locality acquired during his missionary excursions. In speaking of the present site, he describes it as "one of the most lovely situations that imaginations can frame". The first prospectus says: "in the choice of Situation, Salubrity of Air, Convenience of Communication, and Cheapness of Living have been principally consulted, and Gerogetown offers these united advantages". In regard to the "Salubrity of Air", it is significant that the college records show the first death among the students to have occurred in 1843. In 1784, Father Carroll was appointed prefect-Apostolic or superior, of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. In 1785 he wrote to his friend, Father Charles Plowden, in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>: "The object nearest my heart now, and the only one that can give consistency to our religious views in this country, is the establishment of a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, and afterwards a Seminary for young clerymen." At a meeting of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, held at White Marsh, in 1786, he presented a detailed plan of a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, and recommended the site which had impressed him so favourably. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> sanctioned the project, adopted a series of "Resolves concerning the Institution of a School", and directed the sale of a piece of land belonging to the corporation, in order that the proceeds might be applied to the erection of the first building. The Reverends John Carroll, James Pellentz, Robert Molyneux, <a href="01776e.htm">John Ashton</a>, and Leonard Neale were appointed directors. In 1788, the first building was undertaken. The work proceeded slowly, from want of funds, and 1789 is considered to be the year of the foundation of the college, as the deed of the original piece of ground was <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 23 January of that year. The land--one and a half acres--was acquired by purchase, for the sum of 75 pounds, current money. The "Old Building", as it was called, was not ready for occupancy until 1791; it was removed in 1904, to make way for Ryan Hall.</p>

<p>In its material growth the college has expanded from the solitary academic structure of early days into the clustering pile that crowns the ancient site. Among its oldest constructions are:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the North Building (begun 1791, completed 1808),</li><li>the Infirmary (1831-1848),</li><li>the Mulledy Building (1831),</li><li>the Observatory (1843),</li><li>the Maguire Building (1854),</li><li>the Healy, or Main, Building (1879),</li><li>the Dahlgren Chapel (1893),</li><li>the Ida M. Ryan Hall (1905), and</li><li>the Ryan Gymnasium (1908).</li></ul></div>

<p>To the original classical academy have been added, as opportunity arose or expediency prompted, the <a href="02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory, in 1843; the medical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, in 1851; the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, in 1870; the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a>, in 1898; the dental <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, in 1901; the training <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for nurses, in 1903.</p>

<p>Since 1805, when the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was restored in <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, Georgetown has been a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">College</a>, with the traditions, the associations, courses of study, and methods of instruction which the name implies. Until 1860 the Superior of the Mission and <a href="12514b.htm">Provincial</a> of <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> generally resided at the college; the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was there for some years; and it was the provincial house of higher studies for philosophy and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, during the greater part of the period preceding the opening of Woodstock Scholasticate, in 1869. Naturally, under such conditions, the college exercised considerable influence upon the religious development of the country and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> progress in the early days. The first three <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> had intimate relations with it: Carroll, as founder; Neale, as president; and Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, as professor. Bishop Dubourg of <a href="11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> was president; the saintly Bishop Flaget, of Bardstown, was professor; as also Bishop Vandevelde of <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. Bishops Carrell of <a href="04462b.htm">Covington</a> and O'Hara of <a href="13633a.htm">Scranton</a> were students. Bishop Benedict J. Fenwick, of <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>, one of the first students at Georgetown, and afterwards professor and president, founded the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of the Holy Cross, at Worcester, <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, a direct offshoot of Georgetown. The Rev. Enoch Fenwick, S.J., president, had a large share in building the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Bishop Neale founded the <a href="15481a.htm">Visitation Order</a> in America. Fathers James Ryder and Bernard A. Maguire, presidents, were distinguished <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orators. Father Anthony Kohlmann, president, was a profound <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and his work, "Unitarianism Refuted", is a learned contribution to controversial literature. Father Camillus Mazzella, afterwards <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, is famous as a <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theologian</a>. <a href="04573a.htm">Father James Curley</a>, in a modest way, promoted <a href="02025a.htm">astronomical</a> <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>; the renowned <a href="13669a.htm">Father Secchi</a> was for a time connected with the observatory, as was also Father John Hagen, now Director of the <a href="15309a.htm">Vatican Observatory</a>. Georgetown has exerted its influence on <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> indirectly through various other colleges that have sprung from it, and directly by the host of its own alumni, nearly five thousand in number, many of them distinguished in every walk of life.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Upon the opening of the college, in 1791, the first name upon the Register is that of <a href="06392c.htm">William Gaston</a> of North Carolina, who, despite the constitutional disqualifications of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in his native State, represented it in Congress, and rose to its Supreme Bench. The number of students enrolled in 1792 was 66; on the opening day of 1793, 47 new students entered. This was a promising beginning, but growth was slow, and for several years following there was even a falling off. In 1813 the boarders numbered 42; the average for the preceding ten years had been 25. The century mark (101) was reached for the first time in 1818; the highest number (317) in 1859. The majority of the students at that period were from the Southern States, and the breaking out of the Civil War caused a rapid exodus of young men from classroom to camp. There were only 120 registered in 1862.</p>

<p>The printed prospectus of 1798, issued by by Rev. Wm. Dubourg (president, 1796-99), furnishes the details of the studies pursued at that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, and holds forth promise of an enlarged course. This promise was fulfilled under his immediate successor, Bishop Leonard Neale (president, 1799-1806). In 1801, there were seven members of a senior class, studying <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a>, <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, and ethics. Father John Grassi (president, 1812-17) infused new life into the administration of the college: he promoted the study of mathematics and secured the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> apparatus for teaching the natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>. During his term of office, the power to grant degrees was conferred by Act of Congress, March 1, 1815, the bill being introduced by Georgetown's proto-alumnus, a member from <a href="11108a.htm">North Carolina</a>. This power was first exercised in 1817. The formal incorporation of the institution was effected by Act of Congress in 1844, under the name and title of "The President and Directors of Georgetown College". By this Act the powers granted in 1815 were increased. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> empowered the college, in 1833, to confer in its name degrees in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.</p>

<p>The Rev. Robert Plunket was chosen to be the first president. The corporation defrayed the expenses of his passage from <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to America. He entered upon his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> in 1791, served for two years, and was succeeded by Father Robert Molyneux, who became the first superior of the restored <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> in <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and held the presidency of the college for a second term at the time of his death, in 1808. The <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> began with very elementary classes, but the original plan contemplated a rounded academic course, and gradually the standard of classes was raised, and their number increased. Some of the assistant teachers were aspirants to <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and a class in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> was formed. In 1808, four of this class were elevated to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, Benedict Fenwick, Enoch Fenwick, Leonard Edelen, and John Spink, the first members of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> to be <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>.</p>

<h2>Present status</h2>

<p>Georgetown University consists of the college, the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine, the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of dental surgery, and the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of law. Clinical instruction is given in the University Hospital, which is in charge of the Sisters of St. Francis, and has a training <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for nurses attached.
