<p>D<font size=-2>IOCESE OF</font> L<font size=-2>INZ</font> (L<font size=-2>INCIENSIS</font>).</p>

<p>Suffragan of the <a href="15417a.htm">Archdiocese of Vienna</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>In the early <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the greater part of the territory of the present Diocese of Linz was subject to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lauriacum (Lorch); at a later date it formed part of the great <a href="11519a.htm">Diocese of Passau</a>, which extended from the Isar to the Leitha. The Prince-Bishop of <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a> personally administered the upper part or Upper <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, while an <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, having his residence at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and called the <em>Official</em>, administered for him the eastern part or Lower <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. To do away with the political influence in his territories of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a>, who were also princes of the Empire, <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> decided to found two new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. These were Linz and St. P&ouml;lten, which in a certain measure were to renew the old Lauriacum, and the emperor only awaited the death of Cardinal Firmian, then <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a>, to carry out his plans. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> eyes were scarcely closed (d. 13 March, 1783), before the emperor on 16 March seized all the landed <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="11519a.htm">Diocese of Passau</a> in his territories. On the same day he appointed the former Official for Passau at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Count von Herberstein, first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Linz. It was the intention of the emperor that the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> should at once assume his office. Against these acts of the emperor the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a> sent, first, an appeal to the emperor himself, which naturally was rejected; then an appeal to the Imperial Diet at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, from which body, however, help could scarcely be expected. Assistance offered by <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was refused by Cardinal Firmian's successor, Bishop Auersperg, an adherent of Josephinism. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a> and the majority of his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter finally yielded in order to save the secular <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. By an agreement of 4 July, 1784, the confiscation of all the properties and <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> belonging to the <a href="11519a.htm">Diocese of Passau</a> in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> was annulled, and the <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> and revenues were restored to it. In return Passau gave up its <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and authority in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, including the provostship of Ardagger, and bound itself to pay 400,000 gulden ($900,000) &#151; afterwards reduced by the emperor to one-half &#151; toward the equipment of the new diocese. There was nothing left for <a href="12131a.htm">Pope Pius VI</a> to do but to give his consent, even though unwillingly, to the emperor's despotic act. The <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction of the agreement between <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and Passau was issued on 8 November, 1784, and on 28 January, 1785, appeared the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Erection, "Romanus Pontifex".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1785-8), Ernest Johann Nepomuk, Imperial Count von Herberstein, formerly <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05572b.htm">Eucarpia</a>, had been the Official of the Prince-Bishop of <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a> and <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Lower <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The appointment was confirmed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> on 14 February, 1785, and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on 1 May 1785. By order of the emperor the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was to consist of a <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, a <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a>, a dean, a <em>custos</em>, and thirteen simple <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>; the members were appointed by the emperor, before the approval of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was received. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Erection assigned the ancient <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Linz as the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, but the former church of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> was, without notification to the Papal See of the substitution, at once chosen in its place; it was not until 1841 that the change was sanctioned by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>. In 1789 the endowment of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was fixed at 12,000 gulden ($4,800), to which were added the revenues from the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of several suppressed <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The territorial limits of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> corresponded to those of the crownland of Upper <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> with the addition of several <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, to the separation of which the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> gave his consent in 1786. At the time of its foundation, the diocese included 26 deaneries with 404 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>.</p>

<p>The new diocese, like the whole of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> at that time, suffered much from the numerous, often precipitate and reckless, ordinances of the government officials, who interfered in almost all domains of Church life and often subjected <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> to petty regulations. As early as 1785 the <a href="15417a.htm">Viennese</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order of services was made <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, "in accordance with which all musical <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a>, novenas, octaves, the ancient touching devotions, also processions, vespers, and similar ceremonies, were done away with." Numerous <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> were closed and put to secular uses; the greater part of the old religious foundations and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed as early as 1784. In all these innovations the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Linz and his chapter aided and supported the government much too willingly. Not only in secular matters did the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> ask for the assistance of the provincial government at Linz, he also sought to obtain the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> for the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of his chapter, as well as for the episcopal and consistorial seals. Nevertheless there could be no durable peace with the bureaucratic <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>, and Herberstein was repeatedly <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to complain to the emperor of the tutelage in which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was kept, but the complaints bore little fruit.</p>

<p>The next <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Joseph Anton Gall (1788-1807), had been of great service to the Austrian <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> system as <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <em>scholasticus</em> and chief supervisor of the normal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. He was an adherent of Josephinism, and permitted the chancellor of the consistory, George Rechberger, a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> and Josephinist, to exercise great influence over the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Ecclesiastical conditions became more satisfactory during his episcopate, but much of the credit for this is due to Emperors Leopold II and Francis II who repealed many over-hasty reforms of <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. The general <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> introduced in 1783 were set aside, and the training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was again made the care of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Bishop Gall, therefore, exerted himself for years to establish a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> institute for his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; it was opened in 1794. Another permanent service of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the founding of a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for priests; for this he bought in 1804 a house out of his own means, and made the institution heir to all his <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. The third <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Linz, Sigismund von Hohenwart (1809-25), had been a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canon of <a href="07088b.htm">Gurk</a> and <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Klagenfurt. He was appointed by the emperor on 10 January, 1809, but the appointment did not receive <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> until December, 1814, on account of the <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> took energetic measures against the visionary followers of P&ouml;schl and Boos, who were then numerous in Upper <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. His successor was the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="15758b.htm">Gregor Thomas Ziegler</a> (1827-52), formerly <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tarnov. Although the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> at this <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> was still dependent to a very great degree on the government in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> how to revive and strengthen the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> spirit in his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. Of great importance was the introduction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and their settlement on the Freinberg near Linz, which was accomplished by means of the vigorous and generous aid of Archduke Maximilian of Este, and the foundation of numerous other religious establishments (Franciscans, <a href="13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, etc.).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The Revolution of 1848 not only increased political liberty, but also gave to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> greater independence in its own province, and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at once made use of the regained freedom to revive popular missions, which had been discontinued since the reign of <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>. In 1850 at his instance a ten day's mission was held by the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, at which the number of communicants was reckoned at 50,000. In the same year the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> institute was placed entirely under episcopal supervision, and an examination of candidates for the position of <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> was established; in October for the first time examinations were held by prosynodal examiners. The session of the Third German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress, held at Linz in 1850, also strengthened the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the diocese. A great development of <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the diocese resulted from the restored liberties of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Much of the credit for this growth is due to the vigorous and unwearied labours of the fifth <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the great Franz-Josef Rudigier (1853-84). His deep religious <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and his pre-eminently <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles, as well as his unyielding will, made him for many years the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> leader of the Austrian <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in their struggle with <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>. Austrian <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, antagonistic to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, controlled for decades the destinies of the country. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> friend and promoter of every expression of <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>: <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, religious associations, the building of churches, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press, the founding of houses of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations, which greatly increased during his episcopate. Ever memorable is the manly stand he took on behalf of the Concordat of 1855. This Concordat was bitterly antagonized and much <a href="03190c.htm">calumniated</a> by the <a href="09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, and was annulled by the government in 1868 and 1870 without consultation with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.</p>

<p>Equally memorable is his struggle against what are called the "Interconfessional" <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of 25 May, 1868, which were hostile to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to the marriage and <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> opposition to these ordinances led to judicial proceedings against him and to a fine, which was, however, at once remitted by the emperor. His defence of the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in regard to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> had for result that the Liberal parliamentary majority in 1869 confiscated the lands forming the endowment of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and withheld them until the downfall of <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> in 1883. The great <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> left a lasting memorial in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Immaculate Conception at Linz, for which he prepared the way by founding in 1855 an association for building the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His successor, Ernst Maria M&uuml;ller, had only a short episcopate (1885-8). In the next <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Franz Maria Doppelbauer (1889-1908), the diocese received a truly apostolic head, whose influence extended far beyond his own sphere of work. He was a vigorous patron and promoter of every <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interest in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. As a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> modern <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> he gave special encouragement to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press, which, even during his earliest years on the mission, he had done much to encourage, establishing personally a newspaper. He founded at Urfahr a magnificent <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys, the <em>Petrinum</em>, as a fine training-ground for the future <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The completion of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (<a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> May, 1905) was also due to his energetic efforts. The present <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Rudolf Hittmair, who has written the history of the suppression of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> by <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. He was born 24 July, 1859; appointed <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> 17 March, 1909; <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1 May, 1909.</p>

<p>Religious life is in general in a flourishing <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a>; there are numerous religious associations and brotherhoods. The <a href="12139a.htm">Piusverein</a>, with its headquarters at Linz, has for its special object the encouragement of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press. The most important church in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the new Gothic <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Immaculate Conception, built from the plans of the Cologne architect, Vincenz Statz. It was begun in 1862 and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1905; the tower, 443 feet high, was finished in 1902. The old <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, originally the church of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, was built in the Barocco style between 1669 and 1682. There are several old collegiate churches (St. Florian, Kremsm&uuml;nster, Mondsee, Lambach, Garsten, Reichersberg, Wilhering, etc.), originally built in the Romanesque period and nearly all rebuilt in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the Barocco style. The most important churches in the Barocco style of architecture are the collegiate churches of St. Florian (1636-1745), and of Baumgartenberg (rebuilt 1684-1718). The most important buildings of the Gothic period are the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church at Steyr (begun in 1443), with a tower 263 feet high, and the church of the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Braunau on the Inn (1439-92), with a tower 300 feet high. A work of <a href="13641b.htm">sculpture</a> celebrated in the history of art is the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a> at <a href="15682b.htm">St. Wolfgang</a> carved by Michael Pacher in 1481.</p>
