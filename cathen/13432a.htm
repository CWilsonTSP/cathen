<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>The Sanctus is the last part of the Preface in the Mass, sung in practically every rite by the people (or choir). It is one of the elements of the liturgy of which we have the earliest evidence. <a href="04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a> (d. about 104) mentions it. He quotes the text in <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs3">Isaiah 6:3</a>, and goes on to say that it is also sung in church; this at least seems the plain meaning of the passage: "for the Scripture says . . . Holy, holy, holy Lord of hosts; full is every creature of his glory. And we, led by <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, gathered together in one place in concord, cry to him continuously as from one mouth, that we may become sharers in his great and glorious promises" (1 Corinthians 34:6-7). It seems clear that what the people cry is the text just quoted. Clement does not say at what moment of the service the people cry those words; but again we may safely suppose that it was at the end of what we call the Preface, the place at which the Sanctus appears in every liturgy, from that of "Apost. Const.", VIII, on. The next oldest witness is <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (d. 254). He quotes the text of Isaias and continues: "The coming of my <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is announced, wherefore the whole earth is full of his glory" (In Isa., hom., I, n. 2). There is nothing to correspond to this in the Prophet. It seems plainly an allusion to <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use and so agrees very well with the place of the Sanctus. The <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of Sarapion of <a href="14658a.htm">Thmuis</a> (Egypt, fourteenth century) gives the Sanctus almost exactly in the form of the Alexandrine Liturgy (Funk, "Didascalia", <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1905, II, 174), but says nothing about its being sung by the people. From the fourteenth century we have abundance of testimony for the Sanctus in every <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> centre. In <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> (d. 373) mentions it (Expos in Ps, cii, P.G. XXVII, 434); at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> St. Cyril (d. 373) (<a href="../fathers/310105.htm"><em>Mystagogical Catechesis</em> 5, no. 6</a>), and at Antioch <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (d. 407) alludes to it (in Ps. cxxxiv, n. 6, P.G., LV, 393). <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (d. about 220) ("de Oratione", 3) and <a href="15415a.htm">Victor of Vite</a> (d. 486) ("Hist. persec. Vandal", III, P.L., LVIII quote it in Africa; Germanus of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (d. 576) in Gaul (in Duchesne, "Origines du Culte", 2d ed., Paris, 1898, p. 204), <a href="08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a> (d. 636) in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (ibid.). The Sanctus is sung by the people in "Apostolic Constitutions", VIII, XII, 27 (Brightman, "Eastern Liturgies", 18-19) and so in almost all rites. The scanty state of our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> about the early Roman Mass accounts for the fact that we have no allusion to the Sanctus till it appears in the first Sacramentaries. The Leonine and Gelasian books give only the celebrant's part; but their prefaces lead up to it plainly. The Gregorian Sacramentary gives the text exactly as we still have it (P.L. LXXVIII, 26). But the passage quoted from St. Clement and then the use of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> (always similar to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>) leave no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> too the Sanctus is part of the oldest <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> tradition. In view of Clement's allusion it is difficult to understand Abbot Cabrol's theory that the Sanctus is a later addition to the Mass ("Les Origines liturgiques", Paris, 1906, p. 329).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The connection in which it occurs in the liturgy is this: in all rites the <a href="03255c.htm">Eucharistic prayer</a> (<a href="01451a.htm">Canon Anaphora</a>) begins with a formal thanksgiving to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for his benefits, generally enumerated at length (see <a href="12384a.htm">PREFACE</a>). This first part of the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (our Preface) takes the form of an outline of creation, of the many <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> given to Patriarchs and Prophets in the <a href="10582c.htm">Old Law</a> and so to the crowning benefit of our <a href="12677d.htm">redemption</a> by Christ, to His life and Passion, to the institution of the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> and the words of institution, all in the scheme of a thanksgiving for these things (cf. ib.). Before the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> comes to the mention of our Lord it always refers to the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>. In "Apost. Const.", VIII, XII (Brightman, op. cit., 15-18), they occur twice, at the beginning as being the first creatures and again at the end of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> history &#151; possibly in connection with the place of Isaias who mentions them. In St. James's liturgy this part of the <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> is much shorter and the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> are named once only (ibid., p. 50); so also in St. Mark they come only once (pp. 131-32). They are always named at length and with much solemnity as those who join with us in praising <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. So the description in <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs1">Isaiah 6:1-4</a>, must have attracted attention very early as expressing this <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> praise of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and as summing up (in v. 3) just the note of the first part of the <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>. The Sanctus simply continues the Preface. It is a quotation of what the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> say. We thank <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> with the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, who say unceasingly: "Holy, holy, holy", etc. <a href="09324a.htm">Logically</a> the celebrant could very well himself say or sing the Sanctus. But, apparently from the beginning of its <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> use (so already Clem. Rom.), one of the dramatic touches that continually adorn the liturgy was added here. We too desire to say with the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>: "Holy, holy, holy"; so when the celebrant comes to the quotation, the people (or choir) interrupt and themselves sing these words, continuing his sentence. The interruption is important since it is the chief cause of the separation of the original first part of the <a href="03255c.htm">eucharistic prayer</a> (the Preface) at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the rest and the reason why this first part is still sung aloud although the continuation is said in a low voice. The only rite that has no Sanctus is that of the <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> Church Order (Brightman, op. cit., 190).</p>

<h2 id="section2">The Sanctus in the Eastern Rites</h2>

<p>In the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of St. James and St. Mark and the Byzantine Rite (Brightman, loc. cit.) the introductory sentence calls it the "hymn of victory" (<em>ton epinikion hymnon</em>). This has become its usual name in Greek. It should never be called the Trisagion, which is a different <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> formula ("Holy <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, Holy Strong One, Holy Immortal One have mercy on us") occurring in another part of the service. In "Apost. Const.", VIII, XII, 27, the form of the Epinikion is: "Holy, holy, holy the Lord of Hosts (<em>sabaoth</em>). Full (are) the <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth of his glory. Blessed for ever. <a href="01407b.htm">Amen</a>." St. James has: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord (voc.) of hosts. Full (are) the <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth of thy Glory. <a href="07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> (he) in the highest. Blessed (is) he that comes in the name of the Lord. <a href="07472b.htm">Hosanna</a>, (he) in the highest." In this the cry of the people on <a href="11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> (<a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs9">Matthew 21:9</a>, modified) is added (cf. the Jacobite form, Brightman, p. 86). Alexandria has only the text of Isaias (ib. 132; and Coptic, in Greek, 176; <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a>, p. 231). In the Greek Alexandrine form (St. Mark) the text occurs twice. First the celebrant quotes it himself as said by the <a href="03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and <a href="13725b.htm">seraphim</a>; then he continues aloud: "for all things always call thee holy (<em>hagiazei</em>) and with all who call thee holy receive, Master and Lord, our hallowing (<em>hagiasmon</em>) who with them sing, saying . . ." and the people repeat the Epinikion (Brightman, p. 132). The <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> have a considerably extended form of <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs3">Isaiah 6:3</a>, and <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs9">Matthew 21:9</a>, in the third <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> (ib. 284). The Byzantine Rite has the form of St. James (ib. 323-324), so also the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> (p. 436). In all Eastern rites only the sentence that immediately introduces the Epinikion is said aloud, as an Ekphonesis.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section3">The Sanctus in the West</h2>

<p>In Latin it is the "Tersanctus" or simply the "Sanctus". "Hymnus angelicus" is ambiguous and should be avoided, since this is the usual name for the <a href="06583a.htm">Gloria in Excelsis</a>. Germanus of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> bears witness to it in the <a href="06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> (Ep. I; P.L., LXXII, 89 seq.; see above). Its form was as at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Mozarabic Sanctus is almost the Roman one; but it has for the first <a href="07472b.htm">Hosanna</a>: "Osanna filio David" (more literally <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs9">Matthew 21:9</a>) and the additional exclamations "Agyos, agyos, agyos Kyrie o theos" (P.L., LXXXV, 548 cfr. 116). <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> has exactly our form. It may be noted that the Gallican and Mozarabic <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, following the tradition of Antioch and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Brightman, op. cit., pp. 19, 51), continue the <a href="01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> by taking up the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Sanctus: "Vere sanctus, vere benedictus Dominus noster Iesus Christus" (P.L., LXXXV, 548) and so coming almost at once to the words of Institution: This <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which varies in each Mass, is called "Post Sanctus", or "Vere Sanctus". <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> has one remnant of this on <a href="07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> (Duchesne, ib. 205). At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the Sanctus is described in "Ordo Rom.", I, as "hymnus angelicus, id est Sanctus" (P.L., LXXVIII, 945). It is sung by the regionary <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> (ib.). So also "Ordo Rom.", II, which notes that <a href="07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> is sung twice (ib. 974). C. Atchley thinks that this marks the beginning of the addition of the Benedictus verses to the Sanctus, that originally these were an acclamation to the celebrating <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and that they were only later directed towards the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. In "Apost. Connst.", VIII, XIII, 13 (Brightman, 24), these verses are sung at the <a href="05380b.htm">Elevation</a> just before Communion, then they were pushed back to become an appendix to the Sanctus, where they coincide more or less with the moment of <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Mr. Atchley further thinks that the Benedictus in the <a href="13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> is a Gallican addition of the eleventh century ("Ordo Romanus Primus", London, 1905, pp. 90-5). That the verses of <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs9">Matthew 21:9</a>, were first used as a salutation to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is quite probable (cf. Peregrinatio Silvi&aelig;, ed. Gamurrini, 59-60). It is less likely that they are a late Gallican addition at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Their occurrence in the <a href="08371a.htm">liturgy of Jerusalem-Antioch</a> may well be one more example of the relation between that centre and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the earliest ages (see <a href="03255c.htm">CANON OF THE MASS</a>).</p>

<p>We do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> at what moment the chant of the Sanctus was taken from the <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> and given to the <a href="13547b.htm"><em>schola cantorum</em></a>. This is merely part of a general tendency to entrust music that was getting more ornate and difficult to trained singers. So the Gradual was once sung by a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>. The "Ordo Rom. V" implies that the <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> no longer sing the Sanctus (P.L. LXXVIII, 988). In "Ordo XI", 20 (ib. 1033), it is sung by the "Basilicarii". <a href="07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> (d. 593) says it is sung by the people (de mirac. S. Martini, II, 14; P.L. LXXI). The notice of the <a href="09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> that <a href="14031b.htm">Pope Sixtus I</a> (119-128) ordered the people to sing the Sanctus cannot be correct. It seems that it was not sung always at every Mass. The Second Council of <a href="16078b.htm">Vaison</a> finds it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to command that it should not be omitted in <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> nor at requiems (Can. 3; <a href="07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, "Histoire des Conciles" II, 1114). There were also <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> forbidding the celebrant to continue the Canon before the choir had finished singing it (Mart&egrave;ne, "De antiq. eccl, ritibus", I, 4, &#167;7). The ringing of a bell at the Sanctus is a development from the <a href="05380b.htm">Elevation</a> bell; this began in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="08257a.htm">Ivo of Chartres</a> (d. 1116) mentions it (Ep. 142) and Durandus (Rationale, IV, 41, &#167;53). It was rung to call people to church that they might see the <a href="05380b.htm">Elevation</a>. The Sanctus bell is an earlier warning that the Canon is about to begin. The <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> still say nothing about the bell at the Sanctus. It was (and in places still is) usual to ring the great church bell, at least at high Mass. The hand-bell was only a warning to the ringers in the tower (Gavanti-Merati, "Thesaurus S. Rituum", II, 7, <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1762, p. 156).</p>

<p>The text of the Roman Sanctus is first, Isa., vi, 3, with 'pleni sunt coeli et terra gloria tua" instead of "plena est omnis terra gloria eius". In this way (as at Antioch and Alexandria) it is made into a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> by the use of the second person. In all <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a> the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> for "hosts" <em>sabaoth</em>) is kept, as in the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> (Vulgate, "exercituum"). The "Lord of hosts" is a very old <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a> title, in the <a href="12223b.htm">polytheistic religions</a> apparently for the moon-god, the hosts being the stars (as in <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs1">Genesis 2:1</a>; <a href="../bible/psa032.htm#vrs6">Psalm 32:6</a>). To the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> these hosts were the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> (cf. Lc., II, 13). Then follows the acclamation of <a href="11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> in <a href="../bible/mat021.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>. It is based on <a href="../bible/psa117.htm#vrs25">Psalm 117:25-26</a>; but the source of the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> text is, of course, the text in the Gospel. <a href="07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> is in the Greek text and <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, left as a practically untranslatable exclamation of triumph. It means literally "Oh help", but in <a href="../bible/mat021.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>, it is already a triumphant interjection (like <em>Alleluia</em>). In "Didache", X, 6, it occurs as a <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> formula ("Hosanna to the <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="04642b.htm">David</a>"). In the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> local rites the Sanctus was often "farced" (interpolated with tropes), like the Kyrie and other texts, to fill up the long musical <em><a href="10765b.htm">neums</a></em>. Specimens of such farcings, including one attributed to <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, may be seen in <a href="02645b.htm">Bona</a>, "Rerum liturgicarum", II, 10, &#167;4 (ed. Paris, 1672), p. 418. The skeleton of a Mass at the blessing of palms retains not only a Preface but also a Sanctus, sung to the original "simple" tone. The many other <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> (blessing of the font, ordinations, etc.) that are modelled on the Preface diverge from its scheme as they proceed and do not end with a Sanctus.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Present rite</h2>

<p>At high Mass as soon as the celebrant has sung the last word of the Preface (<em>dicentes</em>) the choir begins the Sanctus, continuing his phrase. They should sing it straight through, including the Benedictus. The custom of waiting till after the <a href="05380b.htm">Elevation</a> and then adding the Benedictus, once common, is now abolished by the <a href="13216a.htm">rubric</a> ("De ritibus servandis in cantu miss&aelig;, VII) of the Vatican Gradual. It was a dramatic effect that never had any warrant. Sanctus and Benedictus are one text. Meanwhile the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> go up to the right and left of the celebrant and say the Sanctus in a low voice with him. Every one in the choir and church kneels (C&aelig;rim. Episcop., II, VIII, 69). The hand-bell is usually rung at the Sanctus; but at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> there is no bell at all at high Mass. While the choir sings the celebrant goes on with the Canon. They must finish or he must wait before the Consecration. At low <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> the celebrant after the Preface, bowing and laying the folded hands on the <a href="01362a.htm">altar</a>, continues the Sanctus in a lower voice (<em>vox media</em>). The bell is rung three times. Although the <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> do not mention this it is done everywhere by approved custom. It may be noticed that of the many chants of the Sanctus in the Gradual the simple one only (for <a href="06043a.htm">ferias</a> of <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>, requiems and the blessing of palms) continues the melody of the Preface and so presumably represents the same musical tradition as our Preface tone. As in the case of the Preface its mode is <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>.</p>
