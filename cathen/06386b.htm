<p>(Garnett.)</p>

<p><a href="05474a.htm">English martyr</a>, b. 1553-4; d. 1606, son of Brian Garnet, master of <a href="11133a.htm">Nottingham</a> School, then noted for its <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> tendencies. He was, however, presumably a conformist until his twentieth year, when he <a href="06147a.htm">courageously</a> broke with all ties, retired abroad, and became a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 11 Sept., 1575. Here he enjoyed the company of <a href="11729a.htm">Persons</a>, Weston, <a href="14164a.htm">Southwell</a>, and many others, with whom in future he was to be so closely allied, and made a brilliant <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> course under the celebrated professors of those days &#151; <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Clavius, etc. He subsequently taught for some time Hebrew and mathematics; a treatise on physics in his hand is still preserved at <a href="14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>, and he had the honor, whilst Clavius was sick, of fulfilling his chair. He was then summoned to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, where Father Weston was the only <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> out of <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, and he left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 8 May, 1586, in company with <a href="14164a.htm">Robert Southwell</a>. Next year Weston himself was arrested, whereupon Garnet became superior and remained in office till his death.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As an indication of his prudent management it may be mentioned, that under his care the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the English mission increased from one to forty, and that not a single letter of complaint, it is said, was sent to headquarters against him. Though he generally lived in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, the hotbed of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, neither he nor any of his subordinates, who often came to see him, were captured in his lodgings, though perilous adventures were numerous. He was a prolific correspondent, and his extant letters show him to have been in sympathetic touch with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> all over the country. He was also a generous distributor of <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>, and sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> and curiosities, among others the letters of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> to Anne Boleyn, now in the Vatican <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>. He wrote a "Treatise of Christian Renunciation", and he translated, or caused to be translated, Canisius's "Catechism", to which he added interesting appendixes on "Pilgrimages", <a href="07783a.htm">"Indulgences"</a>, etc. These books, now extremely rare, were perhaps secretly printed under his care in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. "A Treatise of Equivocation", believed to have been composed by Garnet, was edited by D. Jardine in 1851.</p>

<p>In 1595 and 1598, Garnet became involved in unpleasant <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> troubles. Some thirty-three <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, almost all of them <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, had been shut up in Wisbech Castle. Of this number, eighteen, besides two <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Father Weston and Brother Pounde, desired in the winter of 1594-5 to separate themselves from the rest and adopt a regular collegiate life. But it was impossible to do this without appearing at least to reflect unfavorably on those who did not care for the change. Furthermore, the number of the latter was considerable, and the <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> was so small that any division of chambers and tables was out of the question. The minority certainly had a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to protest, but they did so in such a rough, unruly way, that they seemed to justify the separation, which was in fact carried out with Father Garnet's approval in February, 1595. An earnest attempt to settle the differences that ensued was made in October, and although it was not immediately successful, the division was given up in November, and a reconciliation effected so warm and hearty that, had it not been for a subsequent quarrel on a different matter, the "Wisbech Stirs" might have been chiefly remembered as a felix culpa. The letters to and from Garnet over the <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> settlement do him the greatest credit (Dodd-Tierney, Church History of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, III, App. pp. civ-cxvii).</p>

<p>The subsequent trouble, with which Garnet was also concerned, was that of the "Appellant Priests" of 1598-1602. To understand it, one must remember that Elizabeth's government had rendered the presence of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> impossible. <a href="01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a> had governed the missionary <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, first from <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a>, then from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but after his death in 1594, a new form of government had to be essayed. As is usual in missionary countries, the first beginning was made with a <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Prefects for the mission were appointed from <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, while those in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> were put under an <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, and this arrangement lasted until the presence of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Queen, Henrietta Maria, allowed of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be sent to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> without seriously endangering the flock (see Bishop, William). But George Blackwell, the man selected for the post of <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> a failure, and had eventually to be deposed. On paper his qualifications seemed excellent; in practice his successes were few, his mistakes many. Difficulties arose with his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, over whose missionary faculties he exercised a somewhat brusque control. Hence <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a>, sharp letters on both sides, and two appeals to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the end, his authority was maintained and even strengthened, but his manner of government was reprehended. Part of the censure for this should perhaps fall on Garnet, with whom Blackwell sometimes took counsel. As to this a serious misunderstanding needs correction. It has been alleged that the <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> received "<em>secret</em> orders to <em>follow</em> the advice of the superior of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> <em>in the affairs of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a></em> on <em>all</em> points of special importance. [The italicized words, which are <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> or misleading, will be found in Dodd-Tierney, III, 51; <a href="09270c.htm">Lingard</a> (1883), VI, 640; or Tauton, "Black Monks", <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> (1901), I, 250.] One of the appellant <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> wrote in still stronger terms, which merit quotation as an example of the extremes to which controversy was sometimes carried. "All <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> must hereafter depend upon Blackwell, and he upon Garnet, and Garnet upon <a href="11729a.htm">Persons</a>, and <a href="11729a.htm">Persons</a> upon the <a href="04764a.htm">Devil</a>, who is the author of all rebellions, treasons, <a href="07441a.htm">murders</a>, disobedience and all such designments as this wicked <a href="14081a.htm">jesuit</a> hath hitherto contrived" ("Sparing Discoverie" 70; Watson in Law's "Jesuits and Seculars" (London, 1869), p. lxv). All that <a href="03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan's</a> "Instruction" really said was "The <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> will take care to learn the opinion and advice of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> superiors in matters of greater importance."</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Considering the difficulty of finding advisers of any sort in that time of paralyzing <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the obvious meaning of the words is surely perfectly honorable, and becoming both to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and to the <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a>. After they had been objected to, however, they were withdrawn by a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> brief, which added that "the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> themselves thought this was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>" under the changed circumstances.</p>

<p>The conclusion of Garnet's life is closely connected to the <a href="07081b.htm">Gunpowder Plot</a>, under which heading will be found an account of his having heard from Catesby in general terms that trouble was intended, and from Father Greenway, with Catesby's consent, the full details of the Plot, with the understanding that, if the plot were otherwise discovered, he would be at liberty to disclose the whole <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. After the plot had been discovered, and Garnet had been arrested, he thought it best in his peculiar circumstances to confess the whole <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> about his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and for this he was tried and executed at the west end of Old St. Paul's, 3 May, 1606.</p>

<p>Garnet is thus described in the proclamation issued for his arrest &#151;</p>

<blockquote><p>Henry Garnet, <em>alias</em> Walley, <em>alias</em> Darcy, <em>alias</em> Farmer, of a middling stature, full faced, fat of body, of complexion fair, his forehead high on each side, with a little thin hair coming down upon the middest of the fore part of this head; his hair and <a href="02362a.htm">beard</a> griseled. Of age between fifty and three score. His <a href="02362a.htm">beard</a> on his cheeks close cut, and his chin very thin and somewhat short. His gait upright, and comely for a feeble man. </p></blockquote>

<p>The execution was watched so closely that very few <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> were secured by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but a head of straw stained with his blood fell into the hands of a young <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, John Wilkerson. Some months later he showed it to a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gentleman who noticed that the blood had congealed upon one of the husks in the form of a minute face, resembling, as they thought, Garnet's own portrait. The matter was much talked of, and the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> personally conducted an examination of several witnesses, who had seen the strange phenomenon. Their evidence abundantly proves the reality of the lineaments which might be discerned in the husk. But to what extent the <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> of the onlookers (which were undoubtedly excited) contributed to the recognition of Garnet's features in particular, can hardly be decided now, for the straw, though carefully preserved by the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, was lost during the troubles of the <a href="13009a.htm">French revolution</a> (L. Morris, "Life of Father John Gerard", London, 1881, 393-407).</p>

<p>As the <a href="07081b.htm">Gunpowder Plot</a> marked a new era of cruelty in the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, so <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> efforts to excuse their fault by blaming Garnet were at one time untiring, and even to the present day his case is discussed in an unfriendly spirit by non-Catholic writers (e.g. Jardine and Gardiner). On the other hand, the great <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, who opposed King James in the matter of the Oath of Allegiance have spoken in Garnet's defense (especially <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> "Apologia", XIII, xiii, 186, and Francisco Su&aacute;rez, "Defensio Fidei Catholic&aelig;". VI, ix, s. 6) &#151; a matter of good omen, considering the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> intricacies that beset his case. It is a matter of regret that we have as yet nothing like an authoritative pronouncement from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the subject of Garnet's <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. His name was indeed proposed with that of the other <a href="05474a.htm">English Martyrs</a> and Confessors in 1874, and his cause was then based upon the testimonies of <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and the older <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, which was the correct plea for the <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of Fama Martyrii, then to be demonstrated (see Beautification and Canonization). But these ancient authorities are not acquainted with Garnet's actual confessions which were not known or published in their time. The consequence was that, as the discussion proceeded, their evidence was found to be inconclusive, and an open verdict was returned; thus his <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was held to be neither <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> nor disproved. This of course led to his cause being "put off" (dilatus) for further inquiry, which involves in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> a delay of many years.</p>
