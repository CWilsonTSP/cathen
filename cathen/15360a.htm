<p>(VERONENSIS.)</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Venetia (Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>). The city, situated on both branches of the River Adige, is the centre of extensive agricultural industry. In the days of the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Republic it was already an important fortress, and was surrounded with walls and other defences by the Veronese Fra Giocondo, and remained so under the Austrian domination and under the <a href="08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. The headquarters of the Third Army Corps are in the Castel S. Pietro, on a hill formerly occupied by the <a href="11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> and Lombard kings and the Visconti.</p>

<h2>Churches and principal buildings</h2>

<p>The duomo (<a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>) is in the Romanesque style of the twelfth century, with additions of the fifteenth. It has an <a href="01381e.htm">ambo</a> by Sanmicheli; pictures by Liberale da Verona (Adoration of the <a href="09527a.htm">Magi</a>) and <a href="14742a.htm">Titian</a> (Assumption), and frescoes by Falconnetto. Adjoining it is S. Giovanni in Fonte, with a <a href="02274a.htm">baptismal font</a> decorated with reliefs of the twelfth century; in the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> are remains of ancient marbles and <a href="10584a.htm">mosaics</a>. In the palace of the canons is the capitular <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>, rich in precious <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. S. Maria Antica is surrounded with the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> (<em>arche</em>) of the Scaligeri, lords of Verona, in the form of Gothic shrines, or <em>tempietti</em>, enclosing their sarcophagi (Can Grande, with equestrian <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a>; Can Signorio, the finest work, by Bonino da Campione). S. Anastasia, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church (1261), is Gothic; the <a href="13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of the great door represent scenes from the life of St. Peter Martyr; inside is the <em>gobbo</em> (hunchback), bearing the holy-water font, also pictures by Niccolo Giolfino, Giunesello da Folgaria (Entombment of Christ), Liberale, and Girolamo dai Libri; frescoes by Antichiero, Vittore Pisano (St. George), and Michele da Verona. S. Bernardino, fifteenth century, is adorned with frescoes by Giolfino, Morone, and others; noteworthy is the Pellegrini <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, by Sanmicheli (1557). Of S. Zeno Maggiore mention is made as early as the time of <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>; in its present form it dates back to the eleventh century, and was restored in 1870. Its doorway is decorated with Biblical <a href="13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by Nicolaus and Guilelmus, and the bronze doors themselves are sculptured with scenes from the life of <a href="15754d.htm">St. Zeno</a>. The <a href="01381e.htm">ambo</a> is <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> with marble <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> (1200). The <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="15754d.htm">St. Zeno</a> is of the ninth century, and a Madonna <a href="05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in the midst of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> is by <a href="09610a.htm">Mantegna</a>. Adjoining the church was a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which was suppressed in 1770. S. Fermo Maggiore, a <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> (1313), belonged first to the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, then to the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; its <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is adorned with marbles and with the sarcophagus of the physician Aventino Fracastoro (1350); it contains pictures by Caroto, also by Giambattista del Moro, Liberale, and <a href="14780a.htm">Torbido</a>, frescoes of the fourteenth century; the marble <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> dates from 1396. Santi Nazzaro e Celso, a very ancient church, restored in the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, contains pictures by <a href="10511b.htm">Montagna</a> and frescoes by <a href="05787c.htm">Farinato</a> and Falconetto. S. Maria in Organo was restored by Sanmicheli in 1481, and contains frescoes by Marone; in its choir and <a href="13322b.htm">sacristy</a> are <em>intarsie</em> (inlaid decorations) by Fra Giovanni (1499). Among the other churches are S. Giorgio in Braide, S. Stefano, and S. Eufemia (thirteenth century).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>A very fine public piazza is that known as the Erbe, the ancient forum of the city, surrounded by imposing and historical residences--the Palazzo Maffei, the Mazzanti, once the residence of the Scaligeri, the Case dei Mercanti (1210), the Casa della Fontana (tenth century)--and an ancient <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> known as the Verona. In the middle of the piazza is the tribune where, in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, trials used to be held. The Piazza dei Signori is surrounded by the Palazzo dei Giurisconsulti [Lawyers (1263)] and the Palazzo della Ragione (1193). The court house and the prefecture were formerly palaces of the Scaligeri; the Council Building, the old Municipio (1476), has a tower (the Civica) 272 feet high. Other buildings are: the Rocca (Keep) of Can Grande II; the Teatro Filarmonico, containing the lapidary museum; the Palazzo Lavezzola Pompeii, built by Sanmicheli in 1530, containing the civic museum, with its prehistoric discoveries, Roman and <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, and a special collection of Veronese <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a>. The communal <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> contains 100,000 volumes and 3100 <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Noteworthy among the Roman antiquities are the arena, which is in better preservation than the Colosseum at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the remains of a theatre, the greater axis of which is 502 feet in length; the Borsari Gates (265); the Arch of the Lions. The ancient <a href="03510a.htm">Christian cemetery</a> has not been found.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Verona, or Veronia, was a city of the Euganei, who were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cede it to the Cenomani (550 B.C.). With the conquest of the Valley of the Po the Veronese territory became Roman (about 300 B.C.); Verona had the franchise in 59. The city derived importance from being at the intersection of many roads. With the taking of Verona (A.D. 489) the Gothic domination of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> began; <a href="14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> built his palace there, and in Germanic legend the name of Verona is linked with his. This city remained in the power of the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> all through the Gothic <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, with the exception of a single day in 541, when an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> officer effected an entrance. Dissensions which arose among the Byzantine generals in regard to booty enabled the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> to regain possession. In 552 Valerian vainly endeavoured to gain an entrance, and only the complete overthrow of the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> brought abut its surrender. In 569 it was taken by Alboin, King of the Lombards, in whose kingdom it was, in a sense, the second city in importance. There Alboin himself was killed by his own wife in 572. The dukes of <a href="15038a.htm">Treviso</a> often resided there. At Verona Adalgisus, son of Desiderius, in 774 made his last desperate resistance to <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom. Verona was then the ordinary residence of the kings of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the government of the city becoming hereditary in the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Count Milo, progenitor of the counts of San Bonifacio. From 880 to 951 the two Berengarii resided there. <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a> ceded to Verona the marquisate dependent on the Duchy of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.</p>

<p>The splendor of the city in those days, dominated by its forty- eight towers, is described in a Latin ode of which we shall speak later on. The increasing wealth of the burgher <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1100 we find Verona organized as a commune. The San Bonifacio could at most hold the office of podest&egrave; of the city now and then. Verona, at first undecided, was forced by <a href="15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> to join the Lombard League. This, however, gave rise to the factions of <a href="07056c.htm">Guelphs and Ghibellines</a> in Verona. When Ezzelino IV was elected podest&egrave;, in 1226, he was able to convert the office into a permanent lordship, and in 1257 he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona (Campi di Verona). Upon his death the Great Council elected as podest&egrave; Mastino della Scala, and he converted the "signoria" into a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> possession, though leaving the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re-elected podest&egrave; in 1262, he effected a <em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em>, and was acclaimed <em>capitano del popolo</em>, with the command of the communal troops. It was not without long internal discord that he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the function of confirming the podest&egrave;. In 1272 Mastino was killed by the faction of the nobles. The reign of his son Alberto as <em>capitano</em> (1277-1302) was one incessant <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his sons, Bartolommeo, Alboino, and Can Grande I, only the last shared the government (1308); he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts; he protected <a href="04628a.htm">Dante</a>, <a href="11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, and <a href="06565a.htm">Giotto</a>. By <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> or treaty he brought under his control the cities of Padua (1328), Treviso (1308), and <a href="15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Alberto was succeeded by Mastino II (1329-51) and Alberto, sons of Alboino. Mastino continued his uncle's policy, conquering <a href="02760a.htm">Brescia</a> in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Po. He purchased <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> (1335) and Lucca (1339). After the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, he was the richest prince of his time. But a powerful league was formed against him in 1337---Florence, <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, the Visconti, the Este, and the Gonzaga. After a three years <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona and <a href="15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>. His son Can Grande II (1351-59) was a cruel, dissolute, and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with Brandenburg mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359-75), who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges, and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide seems to have become a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> custom, for Antonio (1375-87), Cansignorio's natural brother, slew his brother Bartolommeo, thereby arousing the indignation of the people, who deserted him when Gian Galeazzo Visconti of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> made <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight (19 October, 1387), thus putting an end to the Scaliger domination, which, however, survived in its monuments. His son Can Francesco in vain attempted to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Can Grande II, was more fortunate; with the support of the people, he drove out the <a href="10298a.htm">Milanese</a>, but he died ten days after, and Verona then submitted to <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular risings. From 1490 to 1517 the city was in the power of the Emperor Maximilian I. It was occupied by <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> in 1797, but on <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> Monday the populace rose and drove out the French. It was then that <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> made an end of the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Republic. In 1866, on the anniversary of the defeat of K&ouml;nigr&auml;tz, the Austrians evacuated Verona, their strongest fortress in Venetia, which thus became Italian.</p>

<p>For the origins of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in Verona the important document is the "Carmen Pipinianum" (ninth century), in which, besides a description of the city and an enumeration of its <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, there is a list of the first eight <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, from St. Euprepius to <a href="15754d.htm">St. Zeno</a>, who died in 380. Less important is the famous <em>pianeta</em> (<a href="03639a.htm">chasuble</a>) of Classe, <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, on which are represented not only the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Verona, but also other <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Verona in the ninth century. <a href="15754d.htm">St. Zeno</a> having been the eighth <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the period of St. Euprepius, and therefore of the erection of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, must be placed not before the peace given to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> under <a href="06366a.htm">Gallienus</a> (260), but rather under the first period of the reign of <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, when the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> enjoyed peace. In the same "Carmen" mention is made of Sts. Firmus and Rusticus, <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Verona, probably under <a href="10074c.htm">Maximian</a>. The list of the earliest <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> is as follows: Euprepius, Dimidrianus (Demetrianus), Simplicius, Proculus, Saturninus, Lucilius, present at the <a href="13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> in 343 (called Lucillus by <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> and Lucius in the signatures of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="13472b.htm">Sardica</a>), Gricinus, Zeno. This <a href="15754d.htm">St. Zeno</a> is called a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> in the "Carmen" and is placed in the time of <a href="06366a.htm">Gallienus</a>. At any rate the existence of a distinguished <a href="15754d.htm">St. Zeno</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verona, a contemporary of <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, and author of a series of religious discourses, is historically attested, and as, on the other hand, the ancient documents <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> but one <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that name, it must be concluded that, as early as the ninth century, the legend had corrupted <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a>. For the rest, we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> from the sermons of <a href="15754d.htm">St. Zeno</a> how deeply <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> was still rooted in Verona in his time, particularly in the country districts. His successor was Syagrius. Other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: <a href="11782a.htm">St. Petronius</a> (c. 410); Gaudentius (465); St. Valens (522-31); Solatius and Junior, who joined the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>; Hanno (about 758); Ratoldus, who imposed community life on the canons (806) and reorganized the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Among the masters of his <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> Pacificus was eminent for his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek and Hebrew. Nottingus (840) was the first to denounce the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> Godescalcus. Adelardus (876) was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for invading the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Nonnantula. <a href="12651b.htm">Ratherius</a> (930), a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and a distinguished author, was thrice driven from his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> by usurpers, among whom was the <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a> Manasses of Arles. He, too, fostered learning in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. Joannes (1027) was distinguished for <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning. Bruno (1073), who wrote some interpretations of Scripture, was killed by one of his <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a>.</p>

<p>In the time of Bishop Ognibene (1157), a distinguished canonist, Pope Lucius III died at Verona, in 1183, after meeting <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> and holding a synod there. There, too, was held the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> which elected <a href="15211a.htm">Urban III</a>, who spent nearly all of his brief pontificate at Verona. Bishops Jacopo da Breganze (1225) and Gerardo Cossadocca (1254) were exiled by the tyrant Ezzellino. Manfredo Roberti (1259) suffered insult and <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> at the hands of the <a href="07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>. Bonincontro (1295) died in the odour of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Bartolommeo della Scala (1336), a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, was <a href="03190c.htm">calumniated</a> to his nephew Mastino, Lord of Verona, who slew him with his own hand, and among the penalties for this crime inflicted by <a href="02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> was the revocation of the privilege of nominating <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Pietro della Scala reformed the lives of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and vainly endeavoured to bring the canons under his own <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> instead of that of the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. When the Visconti obtained possession of Verona, Pietro was banished. Francesco Condulmer (1439) founded the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="01106a.htm">acolytes</a> to add to the beauty of public worship and to form a learned and <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> still exists. This institution was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> because, with the establishment of the University of Verona, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> had been suppressed, and the young <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> who attended the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> were at that time dispensed from officiating in church functions: the <a href="01106a.htm">acolytes</a> of the new college were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> both to study and to attend <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions. Ermolao Barbaro also did much for the reform of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Cardinal Giovanni Michele (1471) was a munificent restorer of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the episcopal palace, as also was Cardinal Marco Cornaro (1592). For Gian Matteo Giberti (1524) and Pietro and <a href="09279a.htm">Luigi Lippomano</a> (1544, 1548) see articles under their respective names. Agostino Valier (1565) was a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Sebastiano Pisani (1650) was a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>. Giovanni Bragadino (1733) was a mirror of all the virtues; in his episcopate the Patriarchate of <a href="01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> was suppressed, and <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> brought the chapter under the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, at the same time laying down wise rules for the government of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Giovanni Andrea Avogadro (1790) abdicated the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> to return to the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Benedetto de Riccabona (1854), A Tyrolese, was a model <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The present <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Bartolommeo Cardinal Bacilieri (1900). Councils of Verona worthy of note are those of 1184, at which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> presided, and 1276, against the Patarenes who were somewhat numerous in the Veronese territory, even among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>.</p>

<p>At Verona is the mother-house of the Sons of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and their college for the Central African missions. The Congregation of the Stimmatini was also founded at Verona. Natives of this city were the architects Fra Giocondo, a Dominician, and Sanmichele; the <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> <a href="03169b.htm">Paolo Caliari</a> (known also as Paolo Veronese), Falconetto, Liberali, Francesco and Girolamo dai Libri, Brusasorci, and others; among men of learning, <a href="07053a.htm">Guarino</a>, Lipomanno, <a href="16058b.htm">Maffei</a>, <a href="02541a.htm">Bianchini</a>, and others. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suffragan of <a href="01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, then of <a href="15118a.htm">Udine</a>; since 1818 it has been suffragan of <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>. It has 262 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 400,500 <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>; 786 <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; 132 <a href="12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 17 houses of male religious; 45 of Sisters; 4 colleges for boys; 7 for girls. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press consists of "Verona Fedele" (a daily paper), three weeklies, and the monthly "La Nigrizia".</p>
