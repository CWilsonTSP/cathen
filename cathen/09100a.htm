<p>Only three years before the League was established, Duke Maximilian of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (d. 1651), who was afterwards its leading spirit, declared against the formation of a confederacy of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states of the empire in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, proposed by the spiritual electors. Soon after, however, in 1607, he emphasized the need of such a confederacy, "in order that each may <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> how far he may rely on the others." There is indeed nothing more natural than the drawing together in times of discord of those who think alike. Besides, the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> "Union" was inaugurated in May, 1608.</p>

<p>Early in 1608 Duke Maximilian started negotiations with the spiritual electors and some of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states of the empire, with a view to the formation of a union of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states. On 5 May, 1608, there was a conference on this question in the Imperial Diet at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, which amounted, however, only to an exchange of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Two months later (5 July), we find the spiritual electors assembled at Andernach at the invitation of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. This assembly was really held to consider the question of the imperial succession, but the proposed League was also discussed, and a tendency was manifested in favour of the confederacy suggested by Maximilian. Opinions were even expressed as to the size of the confederate military forces to be raised. Maximilian, who took the most active part at the Andernach conference, afterwards sought among the neighbouring princes members for the proposed League. Salzburg showed disapproval; W&uuml;rzburg's <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was not much more encouraging, but the Bishops of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a>, and <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> concurred. Until the end of January, 1609, however, the negotiations flagged. About this time Maximilian won over the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states of Swabia to his project, and on 5 July the representatives of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a>, <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> assembled at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>. Salzburg was not invited this time, and Eichst&auml;dt still hesitated. Here on 10 July, 1609, the participating states concluded an alliance "for the defence of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion and peace within the Empire." The confederates might not make <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> on each other; their disputes must be decided either by arbitration within the confederacy, or by the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Empire; should one member be attacked, the League must resort to arms, or, if prevented from doing this, must take legal steps. Duke Maximilian was to be the president of the confederacy, and the Bishops of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a>, and <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> his councillors. The League was to continue for nine years.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The foundation of the confederacy was at last laid but a substantial structure was certainly not erected at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>. This was not the fault of Maximilian, but of the states, which, always cautious and dilatory could not be spurred to take decisive action. On 18 June, 1609, even before the <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> Diet, the Electors of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> had exchanged opinions through their envoys as to the personnel of the League and the size of the confederate army, for which they proposed 20,000 men. They had also considered the making of Maximilian president of the alliance, and on 30 August they announced their adhesion to the <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> agreement, provided that Maximilian accepted the Elector of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> as co-president. As the arch-chancellor of the Empire, the latter enjoyed great prestige, and was in a position to exercise great influence; consequently, his support could scarcely be termed anything less than essential to the League. Indeed, in conformity with his wishes, the emperor was informed of the foundation and aims of the confederacy. As to its precise object, the members themselves were not quite clear. Maximilian, therefore, urged the convocation of a general meeting of the confederates to remove all misunderstandings. The first was held on 10 Feb., 1610, at <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. Except <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and Salzburg, all the important <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states and a great number of the smaller ones sent representatives. The organization of the coalition, the raising of a confederate army, the apportionment of the contributions to the alliance, and the enlistment of foreign mercenaries, were the questions under discussion. The confederacy received the official name, <em>Defensiv- oder Schirmvereinigung</em>. Only after this can one really speak of a Catholic League. The foreign help on which they principally counted seemed already assured. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, who had been informed by Maximilian of his plan through the medium of Zuniga, the Spanish ambassador at <a href="12338a.htm">Prague</a>, were both favourably disposed towards the undertaking.</p>

<p>But the success of the League depended primarily on the effective co-operation of the members themselves. This broke down when it came to the collection of contributions. In the case of very many of the members, their contribution was, in the words of Maximilian, nothing but a "poor <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>." Up to April, 1610 not a single member had paid his quota, although at that very moment, the dispute concerning the J&uuml;lich succession, and the threatening of the Rhenish principalities by the troops of the Union, urgently required a League ready for <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>. Disgusted with the indifference of the members, which narrowness of means on the part of a few could not excuse, Maximilian threatened to resign the presidentship. His threat at once achieved this, that <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, which had made the giving of a subsidy dependent on <a href="02121b.htm">Austria's</a> enrolment in the League, waived this condition, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> promised a further contribution in 1611. The conduct of the Union in the J&uuml;lich disptute and the warlike operations of the Union army in Alsace, seemed to make a battle between League and Union inevitable. But the internal affairs of the League were to become still more critical. In the year 1613 the exertions of <a href="08666b.htm">Cardinal Klesl</a> at an assembly of the confederates in <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (where the Imperial Diet was also sitting), against the wishes of Duke Maximilian but very much in accordance with the wishes of the Elector of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, succeeded in bringing about the enrolment, of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> in the League. The assembly now appointed no less than three war-directors: Duke Maximilian, and Archdukes Albert and Maximilian of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The object of the League was now declared "eine christlich rechtm&auml;ssige Defension." The division of leadership did not conduce to increasing the League's power, while, by <a href="02121b.htm">Austria's</a> accession, it became entangled in her difficulties, already very threatening in her hereditary domains.</p>

<p>Duke Maximilian, who attached great importance to the League's fitness for <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, showed his disapproval of the <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> resolutions by refusing to accept them and later resigned his post as president, when Archduke Maximilian, of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, the third director, protested against the inclusion of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and the Provost of <a href="05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a> in the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Directory, and was supported in his protest by <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>. On 27 May, 1617, he formed a separate league for nine years with Bamberg, <a href="05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;dt</a>, <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and the Provost of <a href="05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>. But the position in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> as in Lower and Upper <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, gradually became so critical, that King Matthias at the end of 1618 strove hard with <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> for the restoration of the League. A meeting of several of the ecclesiastical states met the emperor's wishes in that, at Oberwesel (Jan., 1619), they decided to reconstruct the League, but on its original basis. It was in future to have only two groups: the Rhenish under the presidency of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and the Oberland under <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the treasury and the military command were to be considered as separate. Maximilian might only lead the whole of the troops, when he had to appear in the Rhenish district. After Maximilian had made sure that <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> would not again claim the privilege of appointing a third director, he summoned the Oberland states to <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, where on 31 May the Oberland group came again into life. The Rhenish group was already re-established at Oberwesel. The two groups bound themselves to render mutual help for six years.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="02612b.htm">Kingdom of Bohemia</a>, in a state of insurrection from 1618, deprived Ferdinand II of the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> crown, and gave it to Elector Palatine Frederick V (26-27 Aug., 1619) Ferdinand's sole hope of recovering his lands now lay in drastic action. On the way to Frankfort on the day of the imperial election he had already consulted personally with Maximilian of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> on the projected warlike preparations. After the election Ferdinand conferred with the spiritual electors at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> concerning the support of the League. With the formation of a confederate army the serious activity of the League began. The critical time, which Maximilian's clear vision had foreseen, and for which, with characteristic energy, he had been long making provision, made him the undisputed leader of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. On 8 Oct., 1619, Ferdinand and Maximilian came to an agreement at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> over the support of the League, and the separate support of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The latter supplied 7000 men to the confederate army, whose strength was fixed at an assembly at <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> in Dec., 1619, as 21,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry.</p>

<p>In July, 1620, the League army totalled about 30,000 men, to which the Protestant Union could only oppose about 10,000. This superiority at once helped the League to a diplomatic victory over the Union, with which an agreement was come to, whereby, during the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, hostilities between the parties of both alliances in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> should cease. <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and the League had thus their whole military forces free to support the emperor. On 3 July the arrangement had been made with the Union; on 24 July <a href="14724c.htm">Tilly</a> had already begun his march into Upper <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. That there was no decisive battle till 8 November was due to the over-cautious and procrastinating imperial field-marshal, Buquoy. Even before Prague he was still averse to a battle. That one was fought was due to Maximilian and <a href="14724c.htm">Tilly</a>. With the victory of the combined confederate and imperial armies over the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> at Prague the first stage of the League's activity during the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> ended. Its subsequent history is closely involved in that of the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>. The strength of the League principally lay in Maximilian's <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> and in the resources of his excellently administered country. But for Maximilian the League at the beginning of the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> would probably have been just as disorganized a body as its opponent, the Union.</p>
