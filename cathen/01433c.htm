<p>A name of <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> origin and meaning, used to designate an ancient people often mentioned in the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. It is by many supposed to be derived from a word akin to the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>&rsquo;Am&#238;r</em> and to mean "mountaineers", "highlanders"; but <em>&rsquo;Am&#238;r</em> is "summit", not "mountain". The name is much older than any part of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> and even much older than the Hebrew people itself; the attempt, then, to fix its meaning by Hebrew usage and the local habitation of the Amorrhites in Hebrew times can only be regarded as misdirected effort. That some of the Amorrhites, thousands of years after the name came to be used, dwelt in mountains can no longer be judged as serious <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that Amorrhite means highlander; its signification still remains obscure. It is worthy of note, nevertheless, that the Amorrhites of biblical and pre-biblical times have usually been found in mountainous districts, although those best known are the Amorrhites of the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a> Valley, whose sway, however, extended to the mountains east of the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Extent</h2>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In application, the name has a wider and narrower extent in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, varying in a manner the reason for which cannot often be discovered. (1) At times it seems conterminous with <a href="03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and designates all the inhabitants of the Land of <a href="03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> before the advent of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Thus the Prophet Amos calls Palestine the land of the Amorrhite, and the race which <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a> cast out was the Amorrhite (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs9">2:9-10</a>); this usage prevails also in <a href="../bible/gen048.htm#vrs22">Genesis 48:22</a>, and <a href="../bible/jos024.htm#vrs15">Joshua 24:15, 18</a>. The same may be gathered from various passages where certain Chanaanitish races or tribes have at one time a specific name and at another are classed as Amorrhite; thus, the inhabitants of Gabaon are called indifferently Hevites and Amorrhites (<a href="../bible/jos011.htm#vrs19">Joshua 11:19</a>; <a href="../bible/2sa021.htm#vrs2">2 Samuel 21:2</a>), and of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, either Jebusites or Amorrhites (<a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs63">Joshua 15:63</a>, <a href="../bible/jos018.htm#vrs28">18:28</a>; <a href="../bible/jdg001.htm#vrs21">Judges 1:21</a>, and <a href="../bible/jos010.htm#vrs5">Joshua 10:5-6</a>, and <a href="../bible/eze016.htm#vrs3">Ezekiel 16:3</a>). The Amorrhites of <a href="../bible/gen014.htm#vrs13">Genesis 14:13</a> are Hethites (Hittites) in <a href="../bible/gen023.htm">Genesis 23</a>, and the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a> are likewise deemed Amorrhites (<a href="../bible/1sa007.htm#vrs14">1 Samuel 7:14</a>). While the name therefore seems applicable to all the non-Israelitish peoples of <a href="03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, it is to be noted that it generally has a lesser extension than <a href="03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, and the Amorrhites themselves are sometimes regarded as only a branch of the <a href="03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> (<a href="../bible/gen010.htm#vrs16">Genesis 10:16</a>). (2) Another usage distinguishes sharply between <a href="03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a> and Amorrhites, putting both on a level as tribes dwelling with several others in Palestine, the Amorrhites, when located, inhabiting the mountains of central and southern Palestine (<a href="../bible/deu001.htm#vrs7">Deuteronomy 1:7, 19, 27, 44</a>; <a href="../bible/gen014.htm#vrs7">Genesis 14:7, 13</a>; <a href="../bible/gen015.htm#vrs21">15:21</a>; <a href="../bible/jos010.htm#vrs5">Joshua 10:5</a>, <a href="../bible/jos010.htm#vrs12">10:12</a>, <a href="../bible/jos024.htm#vrs8">24:8</a>; <a href="../bible/exo003.htm#vrs8">Exodus 3:8</a>, etc.). There is no evidence that the Amorrhites at any stage of their history occupied the coast lands. (3) Again, the name is applied to the race dwelling on the east of the Dead Sea and the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, from the Arnon to <a href="07288a.htm">Mt. Hermon</a>, and extending eastward to Jazer and Hesebon (<a href="../bible/num021.htm#vrs13">Numbers 21:13, 24, 32</a>; <a href="../bible/deu003.htm#vrs8">Deuteronomy 3:8, 9</a>), comprising the territory of Sebon, King of <a href="07298b.htm">Hesebon</a>, and Og, King of Basan (Bashan), which later constituted the entire possessions of the Hebrews east of the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a>.</p>

<p>These variations in the biblical use of the term <em>Amorrhite</em> &#151; as designating all the ancient inhabitants of Palestine, or only one part or tribe dwelling in the mountainous districts of the centre and south, or, finally, those east of the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a> &#151; are found often side by side, and cannot easily be accounted for; it is to be remarked, however, that the application to all the inhabitants of Palestine generally occurs when it is question of the <a href="07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> rites of the ancient inhabitants, or when they are viewed together as a people doomed for their iniquities to be supplanted by the <a href="08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, in which cases the Amorrhites may be taken as the most fitting type, though they are but part of the population and in reality confined to the districts implied by the other uses of the term. The name of the Amorrhite also lingered in Hebrew tradition as representative of gigantic stature and warlike character, and is likely to be employed when the writer is thinking of the ancient inhabitants as <a href="08193a.htm">Israel's</a> foes in battle (<a href="../bible/deu002.htm#vrs11">Deuteronomy 2:11, 20</a>; <a href="../bible/deu003.htm#vrs11">3:11, 13</a>), while precisely the same population under peaceful conditions is called <a href="03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>. It has been noted by upholders of the documentary theory that the writer of the Elohistic document seems to use both terms as coextensive. This is the usual account of the variations, and it is noteworthy for the view of the Amorrhite history which it embodies; yet it may well be that the name, instead of being first the name of a southern or trans-Jordanic tribe and extended in time to many various peoples, is on the contrary a survival of an ancient usage for all the inhabitants of Palestine and bordering countries. As early as 3800 <font size=-2>B. C., </font> some believe, the Babylonians called <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine the land of the Amorrhite. Centuries later (1400 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), in the <a href="14477d.htm">Tel el-Amarna tablets</a>, the name is applied to the inland country north and north-east of Palestine; <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> inscriptions use the term for the same territory, but extend it to the countries eastward as far as the Orontes. In ninth-century Assyrian inscriptions northern and southern Palestine are included under the name. The term, then, may originally or very early have been applied to all this territory; or more likely it was used first to designate the country north of Palestine and later extended south and east. If these Amorrhites of the north, however, are to be considered one in race with the Amorrhites of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, no light has yet been shed upon their migrations into central and southern Palestine or beyond the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a>. For the present, that part of their history rests in obscurity, though conjectures are plentiful.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section2">Race</h2>

<p>The close relationship of the Amorrhite with the races or tribes usually classed as Chanaanitish is asserted in <a href="../bible/gen010.htm#vrs15">Genesis 10:15-16</a>, and implied in numerous passages where Amorrhite is used in place of <a href="03569b.htm">Chanaanite</a>, Jebusite, or a cognate name. That these tribes are <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a> in origin is <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> by many, but their language, religion, and institutions are unquestionably <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a>. The Amorrhite is represented as the fourth son of <a href="03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, son of Ham. Sayce tries to connect them with a North African Hamitic race, the Libyans, mainly on the strength of the facial resemblance he discovers between them in one <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="13641b.htm">sculpture</a> of the time of Rameses III. This resemblance is not elsewhere borne out and in any case must be considered a precarious foundation for such an hypothesis. No details have come down to us which will enable us to distinguish the Amorrhites from their kinsfolk (see <a href="03569b.htm">C<font size=-2>HANAAN</font></a>), except that they seem to have been remarkable for their stature, strength, and wickedness. They dwelt in walled cities and were warlike in spirit.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Amorrhites and Israel</h2>

<p>Though a very ancient race, the Amorrhites have left but a slight mark on history in pre-biblical times. They were not the original inhabitants of Palestine, though the time and circumstances of their advent are unknown. They first appear in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> as inhabitants of southern Palestine, where they are defeated by Chodorlahomor and his allies (<a href="../bible/gen014.htm#vrs7">Genesis 14:7</a>). The <a href="08193a.htm">Israelites</a> find them in the same region when they attempt, contrary to the divine command, to enter Palestine from the south and are repulsed (<a href="../bible/num013.htm">Numbers 13</a> and <a href="../bible/num014.htm">14</a>). About this period certain tribes of Amorrhites gain possession of the land east of the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a>; so there the <a href="08193a.htm">Israelites</a> next come in contact with the Amorrhites and ask permission of Sehon, their king, to pass through his dominions, promising to do no damage and to pay for whatever they take on the way. The request being refused, <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> follows. Sehon is defeated and slain, and the <a href="08193a.htm">Israelites</a> take possession of his territory from the Arnon to the Jeboc. Crossing the Jeboc, they inflict the same fate upon Og, King of Basan, and his territory (<a href="../bible/num021.htm">Numbers 21</a>; <a href="../bible/deu002.htm">Deuteronomy 2</a> and <a href="../bible/deu003.htm">3</a>). These lands, which were awarded to the tribes of <a href="13214b.htm">Ruben</a> and <a href="06331b.htm">Gad</a> and the half-tribe of Manasses, extended from the Arnon as far north as <a href="07288a.htm">Mount Hermon</a> (<a href="../bible/deu004.htm#vrs46">Deuteronomy 4:46-49</a>). When <a href="08524a.htm">Josue</a> had crossed the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a> and with divine aid had gained several signal victories, fear fell upon the neighbouring Amorrhites. The inhabitants of Gabaon (Gibeon), an Amorrhite city, yielded to Josue, which enraged their brethren. They were accordingly attacked and besieged by a confederation of Amorrhite kings (the five kings of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="07184a.htm">Hebron</a>, Jerimoth, Lachis, and Eglon), and sent to Josue for aid. Josue, coming to their rescue, put the Amorrhites to flight, cut them off in great numbers, captured and slaughtered the five Amorrhite kings and hung their bodies upon trees till the evening (<a href="../bible/jos010.htm">Joshua 10</a>). It was on this occasion that Josue commanded the sea and moon to stand still (for various opinions on this passage, see <a href="08524a.htm">J<font size=-2>OSUE</font></a>). This victory secured to <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a> the tenure of Palestine. The Amorrhites were not driven out of Palestine nor exterminated. Many of them intermarried with the Hebrews and contaminated them by their <a href="07636a.htm">idolatries</a> and vices (<a href="../bible/jdg003.htm">Judges 3</a>; <a href="../bible/ezr009.htm">Ezra 9</a>). In the time of Solomon, and even of Esdras and Nehemias, they are still distinguished from their conquerors, but are finally merged into the general population of Palestine.</p>
