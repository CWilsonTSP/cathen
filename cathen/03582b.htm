<p>The name <em>Chapter</em> (<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>capitulum</em>), designating certain corporate <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bodies, is said to be derived from the chapter of the rule book, which it was the custom to read in the assemblies of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. By degrees the meeting itself was called the chapter and the place of meeting the <a href="03584a.htm">chapter house</a>. From these conventual chapters or meetings of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> for the transaction of business connected with their <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or orders, the designation passed over to somewhat analogous assemblies of other <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Hence we speak of collegiate chapters and of <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters. In general a chapter may be defined as an association of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> of a certain church forming a moral body and instituted by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority for the purpose of promoting the divine worship by means of choir service. If it be a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, however, its principal object is to assist the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the government of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the choir service is only secondary. Members of chapters are called canons.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Origin and development</h2>

<p>From the earliest times the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city aided the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in conducting <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. Considered as a body, these <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> were called the <em>Presbyterium</em>. The custom often obtained of <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> occupying a common dwelling, and this fact, joined with the example of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, led to a uniform method of life. About the end of the fourth century <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, reduced this common life to a more perfect form, and when, later, many of his <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> themselves became <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, they introduced similar rules in their churches. In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> (Bede, Hist. Eccl., I, xxvii) early traces are found of this common life of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. Among the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>, especially, <a href="03729b.htm">St. Chrodegang</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a> (d. 766), formed his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> into a community bound by a rule, which was, however, distinct from that of regulars. From this rule or canon, the members of the body derived their name of canons. Later on other larger churches, in imitation of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, adopted a similar mode of life, and hence arose the distinction between canons of <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and collegiate churches, some of whom were secular and some regular. The main object of the last-named capitular bodies is to promote the splendour of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> worship by choir service. This article will treat particularly of <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters.</p>

<h2>Constitution of cathedral chapters</h2>

<p>A <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter constitutes a moral body or corporation. Inasmuch as it is an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporation it can be erected only by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, according to the prevailing discipline. The chapter can be considered as forming one body with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in as far as it constitutes his senate and aids him in the government of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; or as forming a body distinct from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, having its own regulations and interests. Viewed under the first aspect the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter has the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for its head; under the last, it has its own proper superior. Taking the chapter in the strict sense, however, canonists generally declare that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> must always be distinguished from it; nor can he be called a member of the chapter. Anciently, the principal dignitary of the chapter was the <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, but from the eleventh century the dean, who was also <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, had the internal government of the chapter. In some countries this dignitary is called the <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a>. The collation to <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a>, by <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a>, pertains to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the chapter conjointly, unless in the case of such canonships as are <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> reservations. The <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the head of the chapter belongs to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. In some countries, as <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and until recently <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the Government, in virtue of <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a> or ancient privileges, has the right of <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> to some or all of the vacant <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a>.</p>

<h2>Officials of the chapter</h2>

<p>At the head of the chapter as a corporate body, is a president who, as before said, is called in different countries by various names, though the prevailing one is that of dean. The <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of this official is to convoke the chapter and preside over it. He is also to see that the canonical <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> are observed in all that relates to capitular meetings and the choir service. The chapter appoints a treasurer, a secretary, and a <a href="13322a.htm">sacristan</a>. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> decreed (Sess. V, Cap. i) that a canon <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> should be constituted in <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a>. His office is to explain the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the Faith, and also to treat questions pertaining to <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. A canon penitentiary is likewise to be appointed (Sess. XXIV, cap. viii) with power to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> in the whole diocese. As to other dignitaries or officials of the chapter, there is no uniformity among the various capitular bodies. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> approved of this variety (Sess. XXV, cap. vi), and hence the peculiar <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> or customs of each chapter or diocese or country must be examined to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> what dignitaries, in addition to those mentioned, form part of the capitular body. Among such other officials may be named the custos, <a href="12426a.htm">primicerius</a>, portarius, <a href="12372a.htm">precentor</a>, hospitalarius, eleemosynarius or almoner, and camerarius or chamberlain. Punctator and hebdomadarius are not distinct offices but special functions committed to certain canons.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Other members of the chapter</h2>

<p>These are called by the general name of capitulars or canons. The division of such canons into seniors and juniors, residential and forensic, <a href="12371a.htm">prebendal</a> and semi-prebendal, etc., belongs rather to arch&aelig;ology. The number of simple canons is not fixed by a general law of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> can, with the consent of his chapter, increase their number, except in cases where the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> has absolutely determined how many canons shall compose a particular chapter. In the latter case no new capitulars can be added except by Apostolic authority. Honorary canons have neither a <a href="03252a.htm">canonry</a> nor a vote in the chapter, but they are entitled to a stall in the choir. The number of such honorary canons must not exceed that of the titular ones. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> prescribed in 1894 that a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not to nominate to an honorary canonship a subject of another diocese, without the consent of the chapter and the goodwill of the candidate's own ordinary. The honorary canons who do not belong to the diocese must never be equal to the third part of all the capitulars. In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a> the number of canons is usually ten, and the president is called <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a>. In <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the chapter is presided over by a dean, and besides the canons penitentiary and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, there are usually also a number of other dignitaries.</p>

<h2>Rights and duties of capitulars</h2>

<p>Cathedral canons (capitulars) have precedence, after the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, over all the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> when they go in procession as a chapter. They have also a certain pre-eminence, so that they may be made judges delegate of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in preference to the other <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to canons of collegiate churches. They also wear certain honorary insignia, as a ring, a cross, a violet soutane, etc., and sometimes even the <a href="10404a.htm">mitre</a>. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> decreed in 1894 that canons of minor <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> can use such insignia only within their churches, and that canons "outside the city" can employ them only within their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. A capitular has a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to receive his <a href="12371a.htm">prebend</a> or income from the day of installation. He likewise has a place and vote in the chapter and a stall in the choir. He is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make a profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> before the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his vicar at a meeting of the chapter, within two months of his installation. Residence near the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> is required, as his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> are to be performed personally and not by substitutes, except in very rare cases. The conventual Mass is to be assisted at daily by the canons according to their rotation. If the Mass be offered for benefactors, all must be present. Choir service is also of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and the canons must not merely assist but also chant the psalms. Absence is allowed only for a legitimate cause or through <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of the proper <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. They must assit at the deliberations of the chapter and fulfil whatever <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> may be imposed upon them by it unless legitimately excused. When the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> celebrates Mass or takes part in other pontifical functions, the capitulars must assist him according to the form prescribed in the "Ceremonial of Bishops" and the "Roman Pontifical". They are also to accompany the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> when he goes in procession to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and after the service they must go with him to the church door in a body.</p>

<h2>Capitular meetings</h2>

<p>Chapters, being <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> colleges in the strict sense of the word, have all the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> such bodies possess by their nature or by the positive sanction of law. Consequently, they can hold sessions, ordinary or extraordinary, to expedite matters concerning the chapter. By <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a>, they need no previous <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for such meetings, but the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> can require that they give him notice of a capitular congregation and of the resolutions approved by it. The convocation of the chapter to consider its own affairs belongs to the dean or <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a>, except where a particular statute intervenes. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> convokes it when it is to treat of <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> matters. All the canons present in the city are to be called to meetings of the chapter. At times even those absent are to be summoned, as for the election of a <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, the reception of new canons, etc. The meeting is to be held at the prescribed time and place. Two-thirds of the capitulars form a quorum, according to the regulations of some chapters; canon law requires only a majority. Business is to be transacted by a general and public deliberation, followed by a vote. This vote need not be unanimous, unless the subject matter refers to the canons as <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>. The chapter has authority to make <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> for itself, provided they be not contrary to the general canon law. These <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>, according to the prevailing discipline, must be approved by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In particular cases, where there is a tie vote, the dean or <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has the casting vote or a double suffrage. Like every other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporation, the chapter has the right of possessing and administering the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> over which it has the dominion. Consequently the chapter can appoint its own officials to administer its possessions, even without the ordinary's <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a>. The supreme administrator of capitular <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, as the dean or other dignitary, is to be determined by local <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> or customs.</p>

<p>As the chapter constitutes the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> senate, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to ask its counsel or consent for various administrative acts. Where consent is required, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot validly proceed against the will of the capitulars. Where only counsel is prescribed, the ordinary fulfills his <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> by asking their advice, but he is not constrained to follow it. In some cases defined by law, the acts of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> are null, if the counsel of the chapter be not asked. The consent of the chapter is requisite in general for all matters of grave importance, especially such as place a perpetual <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> on the diocese or on <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, unless the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is allowed greater liberty either by custom or Apostolic delegation. In particular, the consent of the capitulars is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for buying, selling, or alienating <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>; for mortgaging <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>, for uniting, dividing, or suppressing spiritual <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> or <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; for erecting new <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a>, even honorary ones; for collating to <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, if the right be held by the chapter conjointly with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; for nominating prosynodal examiners; for assuming a temporary coadjutor for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; for committing <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches to regulars; for imposing new taxes or contributions on the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; for measures that would be prejudicial to the chapter or diocese, because the chapter is the lawful defendant of <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. The counsel of the chapter is to be asked for the making and <a href="12454b.htm">promulgating</a> of new <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> whether composed in the synod or out of it; for correcting and punishing the faults of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>; for the building of new <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; for administrative acts of some moment, as in appointments to <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and other <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> business. For the matters cited, the consent or counsel of the chapter is required by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> when he is exercising his ordinary <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In cases, however, where he acts as delegate of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, no such counsel or consent need be asked. The chapter on its side is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to show due obedience to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the observance and execution of his lawful commands, in submitting to his <a href="15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a>, and in obeying his just judgment in judicial causes.</p>

<h3>Chapters sede impedit&#226;</h3>

<p>When on account of some physical or <a href="07695a.htm">canonical impediment</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot govern his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the episcopal administration does not pass to the chapter, but it becomes its <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to notify the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who alone appoints the administrator of a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, except in certain cases determined by law, when the chapter can conduct <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> affairs; as when the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has been <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> or <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>; when he is <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or suspended; when the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> dies and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is far away. In the above exceptional cases the chapter may administer the diocese until the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> provides otherwise.</p>

<h3>Chapters sede vacante</h3>

<p>On the death of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the chapter succeeds to his ordinary and customary <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in spirituals and temporals, except to those which he had by virtue of Sacred orders, or by special privilege, or by special delegation of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The faculties <a href="04696b.htm">delegated</a> to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> as delegates of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> also pass to the chapter. Within eight days of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death, the chapter must elect a <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> to whom the whole administration of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> must be committed (see <a href="15401c.htm">V<font size=-2>ICAR</font> C<font size=-2>APITULAR</font></a>), and the chapter can reserve no <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to itself. Lastly, it nominates the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h2>Cathedral chapters in missionary countries</h2>

<p>In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and some other countries, <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters have been erected. As the circumstances of these countries are different from those in lands where the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is canonically established, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has made some changes in the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> governing <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters. The canons are dispensed from residence near the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, and may be <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> or missionaries dispersed through the diocese. They are likewise dispensed from the daily chanting of the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in choir. It is generally prescribed, however, that when the capitulars come to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for their monthly meetings, they must recite <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a> together and assist at a conventual Mass. As a general rule the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and offices of canons in missionary countries are the same as those already enumerated for places where canonical law is in full force. The Bishop is therefore to ask their counsel or consent, as the case may be, in matters referring to <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration and when the <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> is vacant, the chapter succeeds to the deceased <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and elects a <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters have not as yet been constituted. In 1883 <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> consulted the American <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the advisability of erecting them, but the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> judged that the time was not yet opportune.</p>
