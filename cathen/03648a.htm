<p>Composer, born in <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 14 September, 1760; died at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 15 March, 1842. His instruction in music began at the early age of six, his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> being a musician, and at thirteen he had composed a <a href="14468c.htm">Te Deum</a>, a Credo, a Miserere, a Mass, and a Dixit. When he was eighteen he attracted the attention of the Grand Duke, afterwards the Emperor Leopold II of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who allowed him a pension. This enabled Cherubini to study <a href="04436a.htm">counterpoint</a> and the Roman School under Giuseppe Sarti (1729-1802) in Bologna. Sarti advised his pupil to abandon the <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> School, and take <a href="11421b.htm">Palestrina</a> and his contemporaries as his models. It was part of Sarti's plan of instruction to have his pupils copy the scores of the masters of the Roman <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, a practice which Cherubini kept up throughout his life and enforced when he became director of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Conservatoire, for he held that, while text books are good, analysis is better. While still under the influence of his master he wrote music to <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> texts, but soon yielded to the trend of the time by turning his attention to the operatic stage. In 1780 his first opera, "Quinto Fabio", was produced at <a href="01283d.htm">Alessandria</a>. This was followed by six other operas brought out in various Italian cities. In 1784 Cherubini was invited to visit <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, where he composed and had represented two operas, "La Finta Principessa" and "Giulio Sabino", works which brought him the appointment of composer to the Court. The year 1786-87 he spent in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, returning to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> for the winter of 1787-88. He then definitely took up his abode in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at that time the scene of the operatic <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between Gluck and Piccini, the former representing the principle that music should be the expression of dramatic <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the latter the prevailing notion of the Italian <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, that music is mainly an external ornamentation addition to the dramatic situation, an opportunity of display of vocal virtuosi.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From 1788 to 1805 were trying years for Cherubini. All through this period of political change and unrest he underwent many hardships and humiliations and laboured for recognition and an artistic existence in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> without permanent success. His operas, "Demophon", "Lodoiska", "Elisa", "Med&eacute;e", "L'hotellerie portugaise", "La Punition", "Emma" (La prisonniere), "Les deux journ&eacute;es", "Epicure", "Anacreon", written during this time, had to be performed in the small Theatre de la Foire Saint-Germain (where he directed the performances from 1789-1792) because the grand opera house was closed to him. When the Conservatoire was organized in 1795, Cherubini was appointed one of the inspectors. This was about the only distinction conferred upon him during all the years he laboured in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. His high ideals, his independent disposition, but above all the pure, lofty character of his music, were responsible for his failure to become popular with his contemporaries, and especially with <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>. In 1805 Cherubini received an invitation from <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to write an opera and to direct it in person. "Faniska" was produced the following year and received the enthusiastic <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the musical world in general, and in particular, of <a href="07158b.htm">Haydn</a> and <a href="15265b.htm">Beethoven</a>. The latter especially admired Cherubini, considering him to be the greatest dramatic composer of his time. <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, holding his court at Schonbrunn during Cherubinis's visit to <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, pressed him into service and commanded him to take charge of his court concerts. In spite of this, Cherubini could not win the approval of the emperor. The latter preferred the lighter Italian style of Paisiello and <a href="15760a.htm">Zingarelli</a>, who wrote music to which, in the words of Cherubini, <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> might listen without ceasing to think about affairs of state. It was hoped that the opera "Pygmalion", which he brought out after he returned to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, would secure for the composer the favour and protection of the head of the State, but in vain.</p>

<p>Disappointed and discouraged by lack of recognition, Cherubini produced scarcely anything in the two years which followed. He was broken-hearted and in ill health. He accepted an invitation from the Prince de Chimay to visit him and recuperate, and then devoted most of his time to drawing and the study of botany. The dedication of a church in the village of Chimay was the circumstance which changed his career. He was requested to write a mass for this occasion, and the great Mass in F was the result. For thirty years he had written for the stage and had failed to find popular favour. His art was too lofty for general appreciation. Although he did not now entirely forsake the dramatic form (five more operas came from his hand after the Mass in F) he was more and more drawn again toward the field of <a href="10648a.htm">church music</a>, which he had not cultivated for eighteen years. Cherubini's great inventiveness and powers of expression were now at their height. His previous activity and experience had developed and matured him both morally and artistically, fitting him for the creation of works he has left us. In a material sense also there was soon to be a change for the better. In 1815 the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> Philharmonic Society commissioned him to write a symphony, an overture, and a composition for chorus and orchestra, the performance of which he went especially to <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> to conduct. This increased his fame abroad. After the accession of Louis XVIII to the throne, Cherubini's fortunes rose rapidly. He was successively appointed Royal Superintendent of Music and Director of the Conservatoire. He was now at the head of music in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. For the first time in his career he enjoyed the favour and approval of those in power and the recognition of the people in general. His greatest works were written during this period, and as the head of the Conservatoire he influenced the growing generation of musicians, and was an effective barrier against the incipient <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of impressionism headed by young <a href="02495a.htm">Berlioz</a>. Cherubini remained active until 1841, when he resigned his various official positions. Remarkable for organic unity of style, elevation of form, <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of expression and ingenious orchestration as are Cherubini's dramatic works, he became truly himself in his creations for <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> texts. The sublimity of conception, vividness, and sustained power displayed in his Mass in F, in the Mass in A written for the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Charles X, his two requiems (especially the one in D minor for three men's voices and orchestra, which he wrote for his own funeral), place these works among the greatest in all musical literature. Pathetic tenderness alternates with epical grandeur and brilliancy. They are master- works of <a href="10648a.htm">religious music</a> but are not available for <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> purposes. The immoderate length of most of them and their <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a> dramatic character at times exclude them from use during Divine service. Moreover, he takes liberties with the <a href="../bible.html">sacred text</a>. Cherubini's masses, like <a href="15265b.htm">Beethoven's</a> "Missa Solemnis", are frequently performed in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and elsewhere on festival occasions when large vocal and instrumental bodies unite for the interpretation of the loftiest musical productions of the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>. Cherubini left some 450 works, almost 100 of which have appeared in print. Among them are 11 masses, 2 requiems, <a href="10600c.htm">motets</a>, <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a>, cantatas, and 25 operas.</p>
