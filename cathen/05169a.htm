<p>(From <a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>duo</em>, two).</p>

<p>Like most other philosophical terms, has been employed in different meanings by different schools.</p>

<p><em>First</em>, the name has been used to denote the religious or <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> system which would explain the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> as the outcome of two <a href="05551b.htm">eternally</a> opposed and coexisting principles, conceived as <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, light and darkness, or some other form of conflicting powers. We find this theory widely prevalent in the East, and especially in <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>, for several centuries before the <a href="04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>. The <a href="02151b.htm">Zend-Avesta</a>, ascribed to Zoroaster, who probably lived in the sixth century B.C. and is supposed to be the founder or reformer of the Medo-Persian religion, explains the world as the outcome of the struggle between <a href="01233a.htm">Ormuzd and Ahriman</a>. <a href="01233a.htm">Ormuzd</a> is <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> light, supreme wisdom, and the author of all good; <a href="01233a.htm">Ahriman</a> is the principle of darkness and of all <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>. In the third century after Christ, Manes, for a time a convert to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, developed a form of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, subsequently styled <a href="09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>, in which he sought to fuse some of the elements of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> with the dualistic creed of <a href="02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a> (see MANICHAEISM and ZOROASTER). <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy, expounded with minor differences by <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> from <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> downwards, holds generally that physical <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> is the result of the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> limitations of finite created beings, and that moral <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, which alone is <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> in the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> sense, is a consequence of the creation of beings possessed of free wills and is tolerated by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Both physical and moral <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> are to be conceived as some form of privation or defect of being, not as positive entity. Their existence is thus not irreconcilable with the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of theistic monism.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><em>Second</em>, the term dualism is employed in opposition to monism, to signify the ordinary view that the existing <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> contains two radically distinct kinds of being or substance &#151; matter and spirit, body and mind. This is the most frequent use of the name in modern philosophy, where it is commonly contrasted with monism. But it should not be forgotten that dualism in this sense is quite reconcilable with a <a href="10483a.htm">monistic</a> origin of all things. The theistic <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of creation gives a <a href="10483a.htm">monistic</a> account of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> in this sense. Dualism is thus opposed to both materialism and <a href="07634a.htm">idealism</a>. <a href="07634a.htm">Idealism</a>, however, of the Berkeleyan type, which maintains the existence of a multitude of distinct substantial minds, may along with dualism, be described as pluralism.</p>

<p>Historically, in Greek philosophy as early as 500 B.C. we find the Eleatic School with Parmenides as their chief, teaching a universal unity of being, thus exhibiting a certain affinity with modern German monism. Being alone exists. It is absolutely one, eternal, and unchangeable. There is no real becoming or beginning of being. Seeming changes and plurality of beings are mere appearances. To this unity of being, <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a> opposed an original duality--God and unproduced matter, existing side by side from all <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>. This matter, however, was conceived as indeterminate, chaotic, fluctuating, and governed by a blind necessity, in contrast with mind which acts according to plan. The order and arrangement are due to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Evil and disorder in the world have their source in the resistance of matter which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has not altogether vanquished. Here we seem to have a trace of the Oriental speculation. Again there is another dualism in man. The rational <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is a spiritual substance distinct from the body within which it dwells, somewhat as the charioteer in the chariot. <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> is dualistic on sundry important topics. The contrast between the fundamental conceptions of <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and form--a potential and an actualizing principle--runs through all branches of his system. Necessarily coeternal with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is pure actuality, there has existed the passive principle of matter, which in this sense, however, is mere potentiality. But further, along with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> Who is the Prime Mover, there must also have existed from all <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> the World moved by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. In his treatment of cognition <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> adopts the ordinary common-sense view of the existence of individual objects distinct from our perceptions and <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of them. Man is an individual substantial being resulting from the coalescence of the two principles--<a href="06137b.htm">form</a> (the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>) and matter.</p>

<p><a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> rejected all forms of a dual origin of the world which erected matter, or <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, or any other principle into a second eternal being coexistent with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and it taught the <a href="10483a.htm">monistic</a> origin of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> from one, <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>, self-existing spiritual Being who freely created all things. The unfamiliar conception of free creation, however, met with considerable opposition in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and was abandoned by several of the earlier <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a> sought to lessen the difficulty by emanastic forms of <a href="11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, and also by inserting intermediate beings between <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the world. But the former method implied a materialistic conception of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, while the latter only postponed the difficulty. From the thirteenth century, through the influence of <a href="01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> and still more of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, the philosophy of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, though subjected to some important modifications, became the accredited philosophy of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The dualistic hypothesis of an eternal world existing side by side with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> was of course rejected. But the conception of spiritual beings as opposed to matter received fuller definition and development. The distinction between the human <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body which it animates was made clearer and their separability emphasized; but the ultra-dualism of <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a> was avoided by insisting on the intimate union of <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and body to constitute one substantial being under the conception of form and <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The problem of dualism, however, was lifted into quite a new position in modern philosophy by <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a>. Indeed, since his time it has been a topic of central interest in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculation. His handling of two distinct questions, the one <a href="05506a.htm">epistemological</a>, the other metaphysical, brought this about. The mind stands in a cognitional relation to the external world, and in a causal relation to the changes within the body. What is the precise nature of each of these relations? According to <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a> the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is <em>res cogitans</em>. Its essence is thought. It is simple and unextended. It has nothing in common with the body, but is connected with it in a single point, the pineal gland in the centre of the brain. In contrast with this, the essence of matter lies in extension. So the two forms of being are utterly disparate. Consequently the union between them is of an accidental or extrinsic character. <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a> thus approximates to the <a href="12159a.htm">Platonic</a> conception of charioteer and chariot. Soul and body are really two merely allied beings. How then do they interact? Real reciprocal influence or causal interaction seems impossible between two such disparate things. Geulincx and other disciples of <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a> were driven to invent the hypothesis of occasionalism and Divine assistance, according to which it is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> Himself who effects the appropriate change in either body or mind on the occasion of the corresponding change in the other. For this system of <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> interferences Leibniz substituted the theory of pre-established harmony according to which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has coupled pairs of bodies and <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> which are destined to run in parallel series of changes like two clocks started together. The same insoluble difficulty of psycho-physical parallelism remains on the hands of those <a href="12545b.htm">psychologists</a> and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> at the present day who reject the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> as a real being capable of acting on the body which it informs. The ultra-dualism of <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a> was immediately followed on the Continent by the <a href="11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> monism of <a href="14217a.htm">Spinoza</a>, which identified mind and matter in one <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> substance of which they are merely "modes."</p>

<p>The cognitional question <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a> solves by a theory of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> according to which the mind immediately perceives only its own <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> or modifications. The <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in an external world corresponding to these <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> is of the nature of an inference, and the guaranteeing of this inference or the construction of a reliable bridge from the subjective world of thought to the objective world of material being, was thenceforth the main problem of modern philosophy. Locke similarly taught that the mind immediately apprehends only its own <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, but he assumed a real external world which corresponds to these <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, at least as regards the primary qualities of matter. Berkeley, accepting Locke's assumption that the mind immediately cognizes only its own <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, raised the question: What grounds have we for <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> in the existence of a material world corresponding to those <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>? He concludes that there are none. The external cause of these <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> Who awakens them in our minds by regular <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>. The dualistic opposition between mind and matter is thus got rid of by denying an independent material world. But Berkeley still postulates multitude of real substantial minds distinct from each other and apparently from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. We have thus idealistic pluralism. Hume carried Berkeley's scepticism a step farther and denied the existence of permanent spiritual substances, or minds, for grounds similar to those on which Berkeley rejected material substances. All we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> to exist are <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of greater or less vividness. <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> repudiates this more extreme scepticism and adopts, at least in the second edition of his chief work, a form of dualism based on the distinction of phenomena and noumena. The mind immediately perceives only its own representations. These are modified by innate <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> forms. They present to us only phenomena. But the noumena, the things-in-themselves, the external causes of these phenomenal representations, are beyond our power of cognition. Fichte rejected things-in-themselves outside the mind, and reduced the <a href="08603a.htm">Kantian</a> dualism to idealistic monism. The strongest and most consistent defenders of dualism in modern philosophy have been the Scotch School, including Reid, Stuart, and <a href="07123a.htm">Hamilton</a>. Among English writers in more recent times Martineau, McCosh, <a href="10407b.htm">Mivart</a>, and Case have carried on the same tradition on similar lines.</p>

<p>The problem of dualism, as its history suggests, involves two main questions:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Does there exist a material world outside of our minds and independent of our thought?</li><li>Supposing such a world to exist, how does the mind attain to the cognition of it?</li></ul></div>

<p>The former question belongs to <a href="05506a.htm">epistemology</a>, material <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a>, or general philosophy; the latter to <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a>. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that dualism is ultimately rejected by the materialist who reduces conscious states to functions, or "aspects" of the brain; but objections from this standpoint will be more suitably dealt with under materialism and monism. The idealist theory since Berkeley, in all its forms, maintains that the mind can only <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> its own states or representations, and that what we suppose to be an independent, material world is, in the last analysis, only a series of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> and sensations plus <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in the possibility of other sensations. Our conviction of the objective reality of a vivid consistent dream is analogous to our conviction of the validity of our waking experience. Dualism affirms, in opposition to all forms of <a href="07634a.htm">idealism</a>, the independent, extramental reality of the material world. Among its chief arguments are the following:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Our <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in the existence of other minds is an inference from their bodies. Consequently the denial of an external material world involves the rejection of all evidence for the existence of other minds, and lands the idealist in the position of "Solipsism".</li><li>Physical <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> assumes the existence of a material world, existing when unperceived, possessing various properties, and exerting various powers according to definite constant <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>. Thus <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a> describes the movements of heavenly bodies moving in space of three dimensions, attracting each other with forces inversely proportioned to the square of the distance. It postulates the movement and action of such bodies when they are invisible as well as when they are visible through long periods of time and over vast areas of space. From these assumptions it deduces future positions and foretells eclipses and transits many years ahead. Observations carried out by subsequent generations verify the predictions. Were there not an extramental world whose parts exist and act in a space and time truly mirrored by our cognitions and <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, such a result would be impossible. The branches of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> dealing with sound, light, heat, and electricity are equally irreconcilable with <a href="07634a.htm">idealism</a>.</li><li>The teachings of physiology and psycho-physics become peculiarly absurd in the idealist theory. What, for instance, is meant by saying that memory is dependent on modifications in the nervous substance of the brain, if all the material world, including the brain, is but a collection of <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> states?</li><li>Psychology similarly assumes the extramental reality of the human body in its account of the growth of the senses and the development of perception. Were the idealist hypothesis <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> its language would be meaningless. All branches of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> thus presuppose and confirm the dualistic view of common sense.</li></ul></div>

<p>Granted, then, the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of dualism, the <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> question emerges: How does the mind come to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the material world? Broadly speaking there are two answers. According to one the mind immediately perceives only its own representations or <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> and from these it infers external material objects as the cause of these <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. According to the other, in some of its acts it immediately perceives extended objects or part of the material world. As Hamilton says: "What we directly apprehend is the Non-ego, not some modification of the Ego". The theory which maintains an immediate perception of the non-ego he calls natural dualism or natural realism. The other, which holds a mediate cognition of the non-ego, as the inferred cause of a representation immediately apprehended, he terms hypothetical dualism or hypothetical realism. The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of immediate or presentative perception is that adopted by the great body of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and is embodied in the dictum that the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, concept, or <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> act of apprehension is <em>non id quod percipitur sed medium quo res percipitur</em> &#151; not that which is perceived but the medium by which the object itself is perceived. This seems to be the only account of the nature of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that does not lead <a href="09324a.htm">logically</a> to <a href="07634a.htm">idealism</a>; and the history of the subject confirms this view. But affirmation of the <a href="10321a.htm">mind's</a> capacity for immediate perception of the non-ego and insistence on the distinction between <em>id quod</em> and <em>id quo percipitur</em>, do not dispose of the whole difficulty. Modern <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> has become genetic. Its interest centres in tracing the growth and development of cognition from the simplest and most elementary sensations of infancy. Analysis of the perceptive processes of a later age, e.g. apprehension of size, shape, solidity, distance, and other qualities of remote objects, proves that operations seemingly instantaneous and immediate may involve the activity of memory, <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>, judgment, reasoning, and subconscious contributions from the past experience of other senses. There is thus much that is indirect and inferential in nearly all the percipient acts of mature life. This should be frankly admitted by the defender of natural dualism, and the chief <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> problem for him at the present day is to sift and discriminate what is immediate and direct from what is mediate or representative in the admittedly complex cognitional operations of normal adult life.</p>
