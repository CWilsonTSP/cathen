<p>(SANCTI JOANNIS)</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the Province of New Brunswick, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> includes the following counties: Albert, Carleton, Charlotte, Kings, Queens, St. John, Sunbury, Westmoreland, <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, and a portion of Kent. The City of St. John is the oldest incorporated city in British North America, its charter dating back to 1785; it is also the largest city in New Brunswick. Among the earliest <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries to visit New Brunswick, which was then part of <a href="01090a.htm">Acadia</a>, were the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, <a href="02541d.htm">Biard</a> and Mass&eacute;, in 1611. They remained until after the destruction of Port Royal by Argall in 1613, and were succeeded by Recollects. With the erection of Quebec into a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, special interest was attached to the Acadian missions. Mgr. St. Vallier left the St. Lawrence, 7 May, 1686, proceeded to the St. John, and reached Medoetec, an Indian village eight miles below Woodstock. There the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> established a mission, and left it under the direction of Father Simon, a Recollect. Subsequently another mission was formed at Aukpaque. After the death of Fathers Simon and Moireau, the missions on the St. John passed into the hands of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, among whom were Fathers <a href="02066d.htm">Aubery</a>, Loyard, Danielou, Loverga, Audren, and Germain. The Indian church at Medoctec was probably the first erected in New Brunswick. On the original site of this church a small stone tablet was discovered in June, 1890, bearing a Latin inscription the translation of which reads: &quot;To <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, most Good and Great, in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, the Maliseets erected this church A.D. 1717, while Jean Loyard, a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, was Procurator of the mission.&quot; After the Peace of St. Germain-en-Laye (1632), and notably after the Treaty of Breda (1667), there arrived from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> colonies of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants, the progenitors of the Acadians now scattered over New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. About 1767 Rev. Charles-Franqois Bailly, afterwards Coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, ministered to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> along the St. John River. The first native Acadian <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> was Rev. Joseph M. Bourg. Born in 1744, he fled during the expulsion (1755) with his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> to the Isle of St. John, but was eventually deported to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; after some years he returned to Quebec, where he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Mgr. Briand in 1773. Appointed <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Acadia, he had an immense area to govern, with little assistance. In 1813 Bishop Plessis of Quebec received into his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Rev. Charles D. Ffrench. a convert and son of an <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and assigned him to <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> in St. John. He celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the City Court Room on Market Square. A church was built soon afterwards, and at the suggestion of Bishop Plessis it was dedicated to <a href="09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>: it was opened for worship on 1 Oct., 1815. With the influx of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants the number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> rapidly increased. The first resident <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. John was Rev. Joseph Morrisset; he was succeeded by Rev. Patrick McMahon, and in 1828 Rev. John Carroll, the last <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> prior to the establishment of a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the Maritime Provinces, was sent from Quebec.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Between 1820 and 1827 the <a href="10283b.htm">Micmac Indians</a> and Acadian settlers at Richibucto were ministered to by <a href="02593a.htm">Rev. Fran&ccedil;ois-Norbert Blanchet</a>, who afterwards became first <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11288a.htm">Oregon</a> City. In Aug., 1829, Charlottetown (Prince Edward Island) was created an <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, with New Brunswick under its <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Thirteen years later New Brunswick - was formed into a separate diocese; its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. was Dr. William Dollard (b. in Ballytarina, Co. Kilkenny, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; d. 29 Aug., 1851), a man of apostolic virtue and a typical pioneer <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He made his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at Quebec, and was sent as a missionary to Cape Breton, and afterwards to Miramichi. He was <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="03632a.htm">Diocese of Charlottetown</a>, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Quebec, 11 June 1843. His successor was Right Rev. Thomas L. Connolly (b. at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>), who, after receiving his preliminary <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a> became a <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> in the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin Order</a>, and was sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to complete his studies. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1838, and for the next four years was stationed at the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Church, Dublin. In 1842 he volunteered for the Foreign Missions, and his services were accepted by the Right Rev. William Walsh (afterwards <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="07117b.htm">Halifax</a>). Consecrated <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New Brunswick 15 Aug., 1852, Dr. Connolly arrived in St. John, his episcopal city, 11 Sept., of the same year. One of the first <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> he undertook was the building of a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; but it was not until <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 1855, that the building was ready for Divine service. In June 1854, the cholera appeared at St. John, and did not abate until after the middle of August. It is estimated that 600 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> died of it; as a consequence, about 150 <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a> were thrown on the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands. To care for them, he organized a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> sisterhood known as the Sisters of Charity. In 1859 Dr. Connolly was promoted to Halifax in succession to Archbishop Walsh.</p>

<p>A division was then made of the Diocese of New Brunswick; the southern portion (the present See of St. John) being assigned to Right Rev. John Sweeny (b. in 1821 at Clones, Co. Monaghan, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; d. 25 March, 1901). John Sweeny had <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> with his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> in 1828; his classical studies were made at St. Andrew's College, near <a href="03632a.htm">Charlottetown</a>, Prince Edward Island, after which he went to Quebec for <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in Sept., 1844, and was first assigned to St. John, whence he went from time to time throughout the country on missions. His next labours were at <a href="03642a.htm">Chatham</a> and Barachois. He was <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> successively under Bishops Dollard and Connolly, and administrator of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> on both occasions where the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was vacant. On 15 April, 1860, he was elevated to the episcopate; and in 1870 he went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to attend the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. Under him the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was completed; it was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 16 July, 1885. Bishop Sweeny was noted for his wisdom, tact, and administrative abilities. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlement of Johnville, Carleton County, was established by him, and grew into a flourishing colony under his encouragement. In the summer of 1899 he applied to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a coadjutor, and Rev. Timothy Gassy, <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Dunstan's Church, Fredericton, was appointed. In Jan., 1901, Bishop Sweeny retired to St. Patrick's Industrial School, Silver Falls.</p>

<p>Bishop Casey, the present incumbent (b. at Flume Ridge, Charlotte County, New Brunswick, 1862), received his early <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in the public <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of St. Stephen, New Brunswick, and afterwards studied at St. Joseph's College, Memramcook, and at <a href="09047b.htm">Laval University</a>, Quebec; he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> 29 June, 1886. His <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Utina and coadjutor to Bishop Sweeny took place in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at St. John, 11 Feb., 1900. since the beginning of Bishop Casey's administration a new <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> has been erected in the city; and fifteen new churches in different <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> have been dedicated.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>There are two <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men in the diocese: the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, who arrived in July, 1884, and who are in charge of St. Peter's Church in North St. John; and the Fathers of the Holy Cross at Memramcook, who have conducted the University of St. Joseph's College since 1864. There are three communities of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>: the Sisters of Charity, the Religious of the Good Shepherd, and the Little Sisters of the Holy Family. Diocesan <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> number 52; <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 25. There are 2 <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>; 2 academies, 1 home for the aged, and 1 college. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is about 58,000.</p>
