<p>This word (etymologically "elder", from <em>presbyteros</em>, <em>presbyter</em>) has taken the meaning of "sacerdos", from which no substantive has been formed in various modern languages (English, French, German). The priest is the minister of Divine worship, and especially of the highest act of worship, sacrifice. In this sense, every religion has its priests, exercising more or less exalted sacerdotal functions as intermediaries between man and the Divinity (cf. <a href="../bible/heb005.htm#vrs1">Hebrews 5:1</a>: "for every <a href="12407b.htm">high priest</a> taken from among men, is <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> for men in the things that appertain to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may offer up gifts and <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>"). In various ages and countries we find numerous and important differences: the priest properly so called may be assisted by inferior <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of many kinds; he may belong to a special class or caste, to a <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or else may be like other citizens except in what concerns his sacerdotal functions; he may be a member of a <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, or, on the contrary, may exercise an independent <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (e.g. <a href="10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, <a href="../bible/heb007.htm#vrs1">Hebrews 7:1-33</a>); lastly, the methods of recruiting the <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of worship, the rites by which they receive their powers, the authority that establishes them, may all differ. But, amid all these accidental differences, one fundamental <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is common to all <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a>: the priest is the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> authoritatively appointed to do homage to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in the name of <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, even the primitive <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/job001.htm#vrs5">Job 1:5</a>), and to offer Him sacrifice (in the broad, but especially in the strict sense of the word). Omitting further discussion of the general <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and neglecting all reference to <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> worship, we may call attention to the organization among the people of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of a Divine service with <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> properly so-called: the priests, the inferior <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and at their head the <a href="12407b.htm">high-priest</a>. We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the detailed regulations contained in Leviticus as to the different <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in the Temple at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the character and <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of the priests and <a href="09206a.htm">Levites</a>. Their ranks were recruited, in virtue not of the free choice of <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but of descent in the tribe of Levi (especially the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Aaron), which had been called by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to His ritual service to the exclusion of all others. The elders (<em>presbyteroi</em>) formed a kind of council, but had no sacerdotal power; it was they who took counsel with the chief priests to capture <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs3">Matthew 26:3</a>). It is this name presbyter (elder) which has passed into the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> speech to signify the minister of Divine service, the priest.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> law also has necessarily its <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to carry out the Divine service, the principal act of which is the <a href="10006a.htm">Eucharistic Sacrifice</a>, the figure and renewal of that of Calvary. This <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> has two degrees: the first, total and complete, the second an incomplete participation of the first. The first belongs to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is truly a priest (<em>sacerdos</em>), and even a <a href="12407b.htm">high-priest</a>; he has chief control of the Divine worship (<em>sacrorum antistes</em>), is the president of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> meetings; he has the fullness of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and administers all the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The second degree belongs to the priest (<em>presbyter</em>), who is also a <em>sacerdos</em>, but of the second rank ("secundi sacerdotes" <a href="08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> ad Eugub.); by his priestly <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> he receives the power to offer sacrifice (i.e. to celebrate the Eucharist), to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, to <a href="02599b.htm">bless</a>, to preach, to sanctify, and in a word to fulfil the non-reserved <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> or priestly functions. In the exercise of these functions, however, he is subject to the authority of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to whom he has promised canonical obedience; in certain cases even he requires not only authorization, but real <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, particularly to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and to take care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. Moreover, certain acts of the sacerdotal power, affecting the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the head, are reserved to the latter &#151; e.g. confirmation, the final rite of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> initiation, <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, by which the ranks of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> are recruited, and the solemn <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of new <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Sacerdotal powers are conferred on priests by priestly <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and it is this <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> which puts them in the highest rank of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> after the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<p>As the word <em>sacerdos</em> was applicable to both <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and priests, and one became a presbyter only by sacerdotal <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, the word presbyter soon lost its primitive meaning of "ancient" and was applied only to the minister of worship and of the sacrifice (hence our <em>priest</em>). Originally, however, the <em>presbyteri</em> were the members of the high council which, under the presidency of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, administered the affairs of the local church. Doubtless in general these members entered the presbyterate only by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> which made them priests; however, that there could be, and actually were <em>presbyteri</em> who were not priests, is seen from canons 43-47 of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (cf. Duchesne, "Origines du culte chretien", append.), which show that some of those who had confessed the Faith before the tribunals were admitted into the <em>presbyterium</em> without <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>. These exceptions were, however, merely isolated instances, and from time immemorial <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> has been the sole manner of recruiting the presbyteral order. The documents of antiquity show us the priests as the permanent council, the auxiliaries of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whom they surround and aid in the solemn functions of Divine Worship. When the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is absent, he is replaced by a priest, who presides in his name over the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> assembly. The priests replace him especially in the different parts of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, where they are stationed by him; here they provide for the Divine Service, as the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> does in the episcopal city, except that certain functions are reserved to the latter, and the others are performed with less <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> solemnity. As the churches multiplied in the country and towns, the priests served them with a permanent title, becoming rectors or titulars. Thus, the bond uniting such priests to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> gradually became weaker, whereas it grew stronger in the case of those who served in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (i.e. the canons); at the same time the lower <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> tended to decrease in number, inasmuch as the <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> passed through the inferior orders only to arrive at the sacerdotal <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, which was indispensable for the administration of the churches and the exercise of a useful ministry among the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Hence ordinarily the priest was not isolated, but was regularly attached to a definite church or connected with a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Accordingly, the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIII, cap. xvi, renewing canon vi of Chalcedon) desires <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> not to ordain any <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> but those <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> or useful to the church or <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> establishment to which they are to be attached and which they are to serve.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The nature of this service depends especially on the nature of the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>, office, or function assigned to the priest; the Council in particular desires (cap. xiv) priests to celebrate <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> at least on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holydays, while those who are charged with the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> are to celebrate as often as their office demands.</p>

<p>Consequently, it is not easy to say in a way applicable to all cases what are the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of a priest; both vary considerably in individual cases. By his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> a priest is invested with powers rather than with <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, the exercise of these powers (to celebrate <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>, remit <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, preach, administer the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, direct and minister to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> people) being regulated by the <a href="09068a.htm">common laws</a> of the church, the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the office or charge of each priest. The exercise of the sacerdotal powers is both a <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> and a right for priests having the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, either in their own name (e.g. <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> priests) or as auxiliaries (e.g. <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="04570a.htm">curates</a>). Except in the matter of the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> the sacerdotal functions are likewise <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in the case of priests having any <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> or office in a church (e.g. canons); otherwise they are optional, and their exercise depends upon the favour of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (e.g. the permission to hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> or to preach granted to simple priests or to priests from outside the diocese). As for the case of a priest who is entirely free, <a href="14601a.htm">moralists</a> limit his <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a>, as far as the exercise of his sacerdotal powers is concerned, to the celebration of Mass several times a year (<a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>, l. VI, no. 313) and to the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in case of necessity, in addition to fulfilling certain other <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> not strictly sacerdotal (e.g. the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>). But canonical writers, not considering such a condition regular, hold that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> in this case to attach such a priest to a church and impose some <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> on him, even if it be only an <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> attendance at solemn functions and processions (<a href="08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a>, Constitution "Apostolici ministerii", 23 March, 1723; <a href="02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, Const. "In supremo", 23 Sept., 1724; Roman Council of 1725, tit. vi, c. ii).</p>

<p>As to the material situation of the priest, his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> are clearly laid down by canon law, which varies considerably with the actual condition of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in different countries. As a matter of principle, each cleric ought to have from his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the sub-diaconate a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>, the revenues of which ensure him a respectable living and, if he is <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> with a title of patrimony (i.e. the possession of independent means sufficient to provide a decent livelihood), he has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to receive a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> as soon as possible. Practically the question seldom arises in the case of priests, for <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> are ordinarily <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> with the title of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> service, and they cannot usefully fill a remunerated post unless they are priests. Each priest <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> with the title of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> service has therefore the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to ask of his <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is under an <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to assign him, a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> or <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office which will ensure him a respectable living; in this office the priest has therefore the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to collect the emoluments attached to his ministry, including the offerings which a legitimate custom allows him to receive or even demand on the occasion of certain definite functions (stipends for Masses, curial <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> for burial, etc.). Even when old or infirm, a priest who has not rendered himself unworthy and who is unable to fulfil his ministry remains a charge on his <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, unless other arrangements have been made. It is thus apparent that the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of a priest are, in the concrete reality, conditioned by his situation.
