<p>An island stretching from within the Arctic Circle south to about 59 degrees N. latitude, being between 20 degrees and 75 degrees W. longitude. In shape it more or less resembles a triangle, its apex pointing south, its base facing north, in which direction its extent has not been precisely ascertained. It is bounded on the north by the Arctic Ocean; on the west, by Smith Sound, Baffin's Bay and Davis Strait; on the east by the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans. Its area has been estimated at about 512 square miles. The interior of this huge island is a plateau rising gradually towards the east, above which a few mountain peaks tower to a height of more than 13,100 feet. Immense fields of ice, varying in thickness, are lodged on the island, and, on the coast here and there, form steep walls launching mighty glaciers towards the ocean, where, caught by the currents, they drift southwards. These ice-fields and the continually moving masses of ice, which are diminished only in the month of July, constitute the main difficulty in approaching the coast, which is indented with numerous fiords and lined with small islands. The mineralogical composition of Greenland is varied and comprises granite, sandstone, syenite, porphyry, and some brown coal, tin and iron. Ivigtut is the only locality outside of <a href="13767b.htm">Siberia</a> which is known to produce the mineral kryolite (or kryolith) used in the manufacture of aluminum. The valleys in the south-west, traversed by rivers, and the hills facing towards the south-west, are the only sections of the country where vegetation finds a soil to nourish it, hence, as well as by reason of the severity of the long wingers, the flora is comparatively insignificant. In the north the only vegetation consists of lichens and mosses, in the milder regions of the south berries and various dwarfed plants are met with, while the most sheltered localities produce willow, alder, and birch trees, which, however, seldom attain the height of twelve to fifteen feet. Farming is not to be thought of; even the hardy potato yields only here and there a small return. On the other hand, some vegetables, especially lettuce and cabbage, thrive comparatively well. The dog is the only domesticated animal. Chickens, sheep, goats, and horned cattle are bred only occasionally. For game there are the reindeer, moose, and arctic hare, besides numberless bears and foxes which are constantly hunted for their valuable skins. Numerous species of birds furnish the habitants with food &#151; the flesh of the ptarmigan and the eggs of the sea gull &#151; while the eider duck yields its down. Whaling, seal-hunting, and fishing are of vital importance. Navigation on any considerable scale is possible only during the summer. Communication between the different settlements is maintained by means of the <em>umiak</em>, a boat made of sealskin generally about thirty feet in length. For hunting and fishing the Greenlander uses the "kajak", a boat propelled by means of paddles. The staple exports of Greenland are whale-oil, the skins of seals, bears, and foxes, eiderdown, and kryolith, all amounting to about 500,000 <em>kronen</em>. The value of the imports-coal, foodstuffs, and articles of common use-is about double that of the exports.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The original inhabitants of Greenland, the <a href="05539a.htm">Eskimos</a>, belong to the Mongolian race and are for the most part at least nominal <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Zealand. A number of the inhabitants residing on the east coast are still <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>. The creed of the latter shows <a href="11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> tendencies, and the exercise of their religion consists in certain forms of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and curious ceremonies. Without any clear conception of their responsibility to a supreme being they have, nevertheless, rude notions of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> and <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a>. Their <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are at the same time teachers, judges, and <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>. Naturally amiable, though somewhat irascible and vindictive, and careless of cleanliness, the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05539a.htm">Eskimos</a> need constant guidance to prevent their relapsing into the general disregard for morality, which formerly obtained among them. The lords of the land are some 300 Danes. Politically, the country is divided into the North and South Inspectorates. The most notable settlements are: Godthaab, Neuherrenhut, Christianehaab, Jakobshavn, Fredrikshaab, Claushavn, Fiskernas, Sukkertoppen, Ritenbenk, Sydbay, Nosoak, Holstenborg, Egedeminde, Upernivik.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Greenland can hardly be said to possess any political history as the small number of its inhabitants precluded its exerting any influence on the destiny of other countries. Although many historians claim that the Norse colony, which flourished there during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, was destroyed by the Skralings (Eskimos), <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> is wanting, and, considering the pacific character of the <a href="05539a.htm">Eskimos</a>, it is more probable that the colonists, relatively few in number, lost their identity by intermarriage with the aborigines. It is, however, an established fact that the <a href="05539a.htm">Eskimos</a> were in Greenland (at least transiently) at the time the Norseman Gunnbjorn set foot on the island and when Eric the Red of Iceland settled there (983). Eric gave the island its name. In the "Islendingabok", written about a century later by Are Frothi, it is stated that there were found on the island numerous deserted huts, parts of boats, and various stone implements such as are in use even unto this day in the north-east and the west around Disko Bay and the Umanak Fiord. Eric named his first settlement (the site is unknown) Brattahild. Kinsmen and friends soon joined him, and in a short time the Norse population grew considerably. With <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> a higher civilization entered the island. When <a href="11117b.htm">Norway</a> took possession of Greenland there were more than three hundred farms, supporting a population of over three thousand, partly in Ostrabygd, partly in Westrabygd (both places on the western coast.). The means of subsistence were practically the same as those of today, except that cattle-raising was more general.</p>

<p>Greenland was considered a possession of the <a href="11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> Crown as late as the time of the Union of Kalmar (see Styffre, Skandinavien under Unionstiden, II, <a href="14297a.htm">Stockholm</a>, 1880, p. 355). The continued disturbances in the Scandinavian kingdoms caused these remote colonies to be forgotten. Eventually, all relations between the Norse settlers and their mother country ceased, and Greenland kept only a shadowy existence in the <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> geographies. Tradition had it that the island was rich in game (reindeer, polar bears, sables, marten, fish, and certain monsters" &#151; perhaps walrus), and that it abounded in marble, crystals, and so on. Its inhabitants were unhappily lost to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The efforts of Archbishop Walkendorf of <a href="15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a>, to assist the lost Norse brethren, ended in failure. A general permission to settle there, granted by King Christian III, was also fruitless; the perils of the sea journey deterred his subjects. The <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of having practically rediscovered Greenland belongs to the English. Commissioned by Queen Elizabeth, Frobisher made several voyages northwards, between 1576 and 1578, and at last succeeded in reaching his goal. The work begun by him was continued by his countryman, Davis. The <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> Kings, who, as sovereigns of <a href="11117b.htm">Norway</a>, claimed Greenland, also sent expeditions there, the most successful of which was that of Dannels (1652-54). In the beginning of the eighteenth century the settlement and <a href="03712a.htm">Christianization</a> of Greenland recommenced. Factories were erected in Christianehaab (1734), Jacobshavn (1741) and Fredrikshaab (1742). Commerce was developed partly by <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> (e.g. the merchant Severin, 1734) and partly by commercial companies (<em>allmindelig Handelskompani</em>, 1774). Since then the Government itself has assumed control of the Greenland trade. In addition to the settlements established by the Government, the Moravian Brethren have founded several stations. The eastern coast of Greenland was not properly explored and described until the nineteenth century &#151; by Scoresby (1822), Clavering (1823), Graah (1829), the German expedition (1869), and the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> expedition (1883-85).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="07365a.htm">church history</a> of Greenland naturally divides itself into two periods: the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> period, from about 1000 to 1450, and the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> period, since 1721. Leif the Happy (Hepni), son of Erik the Red, visited <a href="11117b.htm">Norway</a> in 990, where he was won over to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by King Olaf Trygvesson, who sent some missionaries to accompany him to his country. In a remarkably short time these missionaries succeeded in converting the Norse colonists, at least outwardly, and in establishing an organized Church. Sixteen <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were founded successively, together with churches and even a few <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. As the distance to <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> made communication very difficult, Greenland, in spite of the small number of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> which it contained, was formed into the Diocese of Gadar, suffragan first to the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen, then to that of <a href="09433a.htm">Lund</a>, and ultimately to that of Trondhejm The succession of its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> is variously listed by <a href="06376a.htm">Gams</a> and by Eubel, and can hardly be ascertained with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> at present. But this much seems certain that, before the colony perished, sixteen to eighteen <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of various nationalities occupied the See of Gadar or at least were nominated to it. Their doings are unknown to history. Tradition has it that Bishop Erik Gnupson joined an expedition in 1121 for the purpose of locating again the eastern coast of North America which had been discovered 100 years previously. During the reign of Bishop Arnes (1314-43) Greenland contributed its quota in natural products (walrus teeth) toward the <a href="11774a.htm">Peter's-pence</a> and the expense of the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. It appears that no <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> visited Greenland after the beginning of the fifteenth century. The succession of <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> closes with Vincenz Kampe (1537). As mentioned above, the settlers received no reinforcements, and either perished or, by intermarriage, were assimilated by the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="05539a.htm">Eskimos</a>. <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> manners and religion thus gave way to <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> barbarism. From the standpoint of the history of civilization it is remarkable that daring navigators had penetrated to the 73rd degree north latitude as early as 1135, and that the first Arctic expedition was undertaken in 1266 under the guidance of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. Numerous stone monuments and ruins recall this early Norse <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> period. Of special importance are the ruins of a Romanesque church at Kakortok which, although comparatively small, warrant us in making inferences as to the style and size of other places of worship. Tombstones with runic inscriptions have also been discovered. A few documents have been preserved to which are attached the seals of the Bishops of Gadar (see Cronau, "Amerika", I, 114).</p>

<p><a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> having disappeared from Greenland for the space of two hundred years, and when <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> had ceased to give the island any thought, Hans Egede, a <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Vaagen, conceived the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of visiting his forlorn countrymen who had lapsed into <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>, and of preaching the Gospel to them. After overcoming all difficulties, he handed in his resignation as <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and, together with his wife and children, went first to Bergen to establish a Greenland trading company and then, failing in this, to Copenhagen. When presented to the king he managed to interest him in his cause and succeeded in launching the trading company. In his capacity of supreme <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the king appointed Egede missionary. After many hardships he reached Greenland, but soon perceived that no descendants of the ancient colonists remained, and that his whole <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> would consist in converting the savage <a href="05539a.htm">Eskimos</a>. By diligent application he acquired their language and, supplementing the spoken word with pictures, induced these people to embrace <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. He remained fifteen years in Greenland and formed a small congregation. After Egede's departure, his son Paul continued his pastorate, completed his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> translation of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and compiled a <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a> in the <a href="05539a.htm">Eskimo</a> language. The elder Egede founded a Greenland <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Copenhagen and also wrote considerably. In 1740 he received the title of Superintendent of Greenland. He died, 5 November, 1758, at Stubbekjoping on the island of Falster. Since that time a number of preachers have endeavoured to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianize</a> the aborigines with more or less success. They were assisted in this work by German Moravian brethren, of whom Stack, David, Bohnish, and Beck had already (1733-34) laboured in the field. Their first followers were a certain Kajarnak, his wife and children, who were <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 1739. After fourteen years' work a small congregation was established, and a mission house built. The Lichtenfels mission was established in 1766; that of Lichtenau, in 1774; that of Frederiksdal, in 1824. After a century of existence there were four mission stations (twenty-seven male and <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> missionaries) with 1799 wards (of whom 1715 were <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and 736 communicants), to which number were added in 1861 the Umanak mission, and in 1864 the Idlorpait. The largest membership was attained in 1857 (1965 members; about 900 adults). Since then decay has set in, ascribed variously to differences of opinion among the brethren, millennarian tendencies among the <a href="10742a.htm">neophytes</a>, and friction with the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the established Church. Without <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> the action of the Government in dispersing the Greenlanders over their extensive hunting territories was an obstacle to their conversion, as their concentration during the winter season would naturally make them more amenable to spiritual influences. It is apparent that, under these circumstances, their conversion to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was in most cases rather superficial &#151; a fact also confirmed by reliable witnesses. The history of the Moravian brethren admits that the entire <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="05539a.htm">Eskimos</a> (<a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>) is limited to reading, writing, and the singing of songs; that thrift and benevolence are almost unknown among them, and that their morality in general is, to say the least, questionable. The first volume of the work describing the second German Arctic expedition of 1869-70 contains (pp. 160 and 195) an account of the church at Lichtenau and the cemetery at Fredrikshaab, which throws much light on the religious conditions of that time and also corroborates the opinion that even the descendants of <a href="04722c.htm">Danes</a> and aborigines most commonly revert to barbarism &#151; a poor result for the self-sacrifice of such men as Kleinschmidt and Cranz, the former a translator of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> and composer of various <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and the latter an historian of Greenland. In 1900 the Moravian mission resigned their <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> to the preachers and instructors of the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> National Church, which had nominally about 8000 members, and left the scene of their thankless labours. Although Greenland, like the adjacent islands, is subject to the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Copenhagen, all missionary activity has been suspended.</p>
