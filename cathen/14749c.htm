<p>We shall first enumerate the various Biblical <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> and then treat the book of this name.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Persons</h2>

<h3 id="A">Tobias (2 Chronicles 17:8)</h3>

<p><a href="10675a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>tobyyahu</em> "Yahweh is <a href="06636b.htm">good</a>"; <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <em>Tobias</em> &mdash; one of the <a href="09206a.htm">Levites</a> whom <a href="08502c.htm">Josaphat</a> sent to teach in the cities of <a href="08536a.htm">Juda</a>. The name is omitted in the <a href="04086a.htm">Vatican</a> and <a href="04080c.htm">Alexandrian</a> <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a>, but given in the other important Greek <a href="09627a.htm">manuscripts</a> and the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>.</p>

<h3 id="B">Tobias (Zechariah 6:10)</h3>

<p><a href="10675a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>tobyyahu</em>, <em>qeri tobyyah</em> which is the reading also of <a href="../bible/zec006.htm#vrs14">verse 14</a>; <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <em>chresimon</em> (<a href="../bible/zec006.htm#vrs10">verse 10</a>), <em>tois chresimois autes</em> (<a href="../bible/zec006.htm#vrs14">verse 14</a>), which infers the reading <em>tobeha</em>; Vulgate Tobia &mdash; one of the party of <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> who came from Babylon to Jerusalem, in the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of Zorobabel, with silver and gold wherewith to make a crown for the head of Jesus, son of Josedec.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3 id="C">Tobia (Ezra 2:60)</h3>

<p><a href="10675a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>tobyyah</em>, "Jah is my <a href="06636b.htm">good</a>"; <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <em>Tobeia</em> (<a href="04086a.htm">Vatican</a>), <em>Tobias</em> (<a href="04080c.htm">Alexandrian</a>), the same name occurring in <a href="../bible/neh007.htm#vrs62">Nehemiah 7:62</a>, as <em>Tobia</em> and in the <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> III Esdras 5:37 as <em>baenan</em> (<a href="04086a.htm">Vatican</a>) or <em>ban</em> (<a href="04080c.htm">Alexandrian</a>) &mdash; one of the <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> that, on their return from <a href="03315a.htm">exile</a>, could show no written <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of their <a href="06408a.htm">genealogy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="D">Tobias (Nehemiah 2:10)</h3>

<p>An <a href="01431b.htm">Ammonite</a> who together with Sanaballat the Horonite opposed the fortification of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by Nehemias (<a href="../bible/neh002.htm#vrs19">Nehemiah 2:19</a>; <a href="../bible/neh004.htm#vrs3">4:3</a>; <a href="../bible/neh006.htm#vrs17">6:17</a>; <a href="../bible/neh013.htm#vrs4">13:4, 8</a>). He is called "the servant"; we can only conjecture what that means. Cheyne (Encyclopedia Biblica, s.v.) thinks that <em>haebed</em>, servant, is a mistake for <em>ha arbi</em>, the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a>.</p>

<h3 id="E">Tobias (2 Maccabees 3:11)</h3>

<p>The father of Hircanus.</p>

<h3 id="F">Tobias (Tobit 1:29, and passim)</h3>

<p>The son of the following.</p>

<h3 id="G">Tobias the Elder</h3>

<p>The chief character in the book that bears his name.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Book of Tobias</h2>

<p>A canonical book of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.</p>

<h3 id="A">Name</h3>

<p>In <a href="04080c.htm">Codex Alexandrinus</a>, <em>biblos logon Tobit</em>; in <a href="04086a.htm">Vaticanus</a>, <em>Tobeit</em>; in <a href="04085a.htm">Sinaiticus</a>, <em>Tobeith</em>; in Latin <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> <em>Liber Tobiae, Liber Tobit et Tobiae, Liber utriusque Tobiae</em>. In the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> and Hebrew Fagii both father and son have the same name, Tobias, <em>tobyyah</em>. In other texts and <a href="15367a.htm">versions</a>, the name of the father varies: <em>tobi</em>, "my good" is Jahweh; in Hebrew Munster; <em>Tobit</em> or <em>Tobeit</em> in the Septuagint; <em>Tobis</em>, or <em>Tobit</em>, standing for <em>tobith</em> "goodness" of Jahweh, in the Old Latin.</p>

<h3 id="B">Text and versions</h3>

<p>The original text, supposed to have been Hebrew, is lost; the reasons assigned for an Aramaic original warrant only a probable opinion that an Aramaic translation influenced our present Greek versions.</p>

<p><em>(1) Vulgate Versions</em></p>

<p><a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> had not yet learned Aramaic, when, with the aid of a <a href="12617b.htm">rabbi</a> who <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> both Aramaic and Hebrew, he made the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> version. The <a href="12617b.htm">rabbi</a> expressed in Hebrew the thought of the Aramaic <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> straightway put the same into Latin. It was the work of only a day (cf. Praef. in Tobiam). The Old Latin certainly influenced this hurried version. The <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> recension of the Aramaic version tells the story in the third person throughout, as do the Aramaic of Neubauer and the two Hebrew texts of Gaster (HL and HG), whereas all the other texts make Tobias speak in the first person up to <a href="../bible/tob003.htm#vrs15">3:15</a>. The following passages occur in the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> alone: the wagging of the dog's tail (<a href="../bible/tob011.htm#vrs9">11:9</a>); the comparison of the coating on Tobias's eye to the membrane of an egg (<a href="../bible/tob011.htm#vrs14">11:14</a>); the wit of half an hour while the gall of the fish effected its cure (<a href="../bible/tob011.htm#vrs14">11:14</a>); Tobias closing of the eyes of Raguel and Edna in death; also <a href="../bible/tob002.htm#vrs12">2:12</a>, <a href="../bible/tob002.htm#vrs18">2:18</a>, <a href="../bible/tob003.htm#vrs19">3:19</a>, <a href="../bible/tob003.htm#vrs24">3:24</a>, <a href="../bible/tob006.htm#vrs16">6:16-18</a>, <a href="../bible/tob006.htm#vrs20">6:20-21</a>, <a href="../bible/tob008.htm#vrs4">8:4-5</a>, <a href="../bible/tob009.htm#vrs12">9:12b</a>. Some parts of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, such as the <a href="04330b.htm">continence</a> of Tobias (<a href="../bible/tob006.htm#vrs18">6:18</a>; <a href="../bible/tob007.htm#vrs4">7:4</a>), were looked upon at times as <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> interpolations of Jerome until they were found in one of Gaster's Hebrew texts (HL). Lastly, the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> and HL omit all mention of Ahikhar; Achior of <a href="../bible/tob011.htm#vrs20">Vulgate 11:20</a>, is probably an addition to the text.</p>

<p><em>(2) Aramaic Versions</em></p>

<p>Besides the Aramaic version used by <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a> and now lost, there is the extant Aramaic text recently found in an Aramaic commentary on <a href="../bible/gen000.htm">Genesis</a>, "Midrash Bereshit Rabba". The writing of this <a href="10286b.htm">midrash</a> is fifteenth-century work; it contains the Book of Tobias as a <em>haggada</em> on the promise <a href="08261a.htm">Jacob</a> makes to give <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/gen028.htm#vrs22">Genesis 28:22</a>). Neubauer edited the text, "The Book of Tobit, a Chaldee Text from a unique manuscript in the Bodleian Library" (Oxford, 1878). He thinks that it is a briefer form of Jerome's Aramaic text. This is not likely. The language is at times a transliteration of Greek and gives evidence of being a transliteration of one or other of the Greek texts. It agrees with the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> in that from the outset the tale of Tobias is told in the third person; otherwise it is closer to <a href="04086a.htm">Codex Vaticanus</a> and closer still to <a href="04085a.htm">Codex Sinaiticus</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><em>(3) Greek versions</em></p>

<p>There are three Greek recensions of Tobias. We shall refer to them by the numbers given to the <a href="04086a.htm">Vatican</a> and <a href="04085a.htm">Sinaitic</a> <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a> in Vigouroux, "La sainte bible polyglote", III (Paris, 1902).</p>

<p>(a) AB, the text of the Alexandrian (fifth century) and <a href="04086a.htm">Vatican</a> (fourth century) <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a>. This recension is found in many other <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a> of the Greek text, has been used for centuries by the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, is incorporated into the Sixtine edition of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, and has been translated into <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> as the <a href="02137a.htm">authentic</a> text of that <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a>. AB is preferred to the Sinaitic recension by N&ouml;ldeke, Grumm, and others, and yet rated by Nestle, Ewald, and Haris as a compendium rather than as a version of the entire original text. It condenses Edna's Prayer (x, 13), omits the <a href="02599b.htm">blessing</a> of Gabael (<a href="../bible/tob009.htm#vrs6">9:6</a>), and has three or four unique readings (<a href="../bible/tob003.htm#vrs16">3:16</a>; <a href="../bible/tob014.htm#vrs8">14:8-10</a>; <a href="../bible/tob011.htm#vrs8">11:8</a>).</p>



<p>(b) <em>Aleph</em>, the text of the Sinaitic (fourth-century) Codex. Its style is very much more diffuse than that of AB, which seems to have omitted of set purpose many <em>stichoi</em> of <em>Aleph</em> &#151; cf. <a href="../bible/tob002.htm#vrs12">2:12</a>, "on the seventh of Dustros she cut the web"; <a href="../bible/tob005.htm#vrs3">5:3</a>, the incident of the bond divided into two parts, one for Tobias and the other for Raguel; <a href="../bible/tob005.htm#vrs5">5:5</a>, the long conversation between <a href="12640b.htm">Raphael</a> and young Tobias; <a href="../bible/tob006.htm#vrs8">6:8</a>; <a href="../bible/tob010.htm#vrs10">10:10</a>; <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs8">12:8</a>, etc. <em>Aleph</em> omits <a href="../bible/tob004.htm#vrs7">4:7-19</a>, and <a href="../bible/tob013.htm#vrs6">13:6b-9</a>, of AB.</p>

<p>(c) The text of <a href="04080b.htm">Codices</a> 44, 106, 107 for <a href="../bible/tob006.htm#vrs9">6:9</a>-<a href="../bible/tob013.htm#vrs8">13:8</a>.&mdash;The first portion (<a href="../bible/tob001.htm#vrs1">1:1</a>-<a href="../bible/tob006.htm#vrs8">6:8</a>) and the last (<a href="../bible/tob013.htm#vrs9">13:9</a> to end) are identical with AB; the remainder seems to be an attempt at a better version of the original text. Independent work is shown by <a href="../bible/tob006.htm#vrs9">6:9</a> to <a href="../bible/tob007.htm#vrs17">7:17</a>; <a href="../bible/tob008.htm#vrs1">8:1</a> to <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs6">12:6</a>, is very close to the <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a> and nearer to <em>Aleph</em> than to AB; <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs7">12:7-13:8</a> resembles each text in various small details. Distinctive readings of these cursives are Edna's <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, "Let all the <a href="01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> praise thee" (<a href="../bible/tob008.htm#vrs15">8:15</a>); and the fact that Anna saw the dog running before Tobias (<a href="../bible/tob011.htm#vrs5">11:5</a>).</p>

<p>(d) What seems to be a third recension of the <a href="../bible/tob002.htm">second chapter</a> is presented in Grenfell and Hunt, "Oxyrhyneus Papyri" (Oxford, 1911), part viii. The text differs from both AB and <em>Aleph</em> and consequently the Greek cursives.</p>

<p><em>(4) Old Latin Versions</em></p>

<p>Previous to the <a href="15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> translation of the Aramaic recension (see above) there existed at least three Old Latin versions of a Greek text which was substantially <em>Aleph</em>; (a) the recension of Codex Regius Parisiensis 3654 and Codex 4 of the <a href="09227b.htm">Library</a> of St-Germain; (b) the recension of Cod. Vat. 7, containing <a href="../bible/tob001.htm">1</a>-<a href="../bible/tob006.htm#vrs12">6:12</a>; (c) the recension of the "Speculum" of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>.</p>

<p><em>(5) Syriac Version</em></p>

<p>Down to <a href="../bible/tob007.htm#vrs9">7:9</a>, it is a translation of AB; thereafter, it agrees with the Greek cursive text, save that <a href="../bible/tob013.htm#vrs9">13:9-18</a>, is omitted. This second part is clearly a second recension; its proper names are not spelled as in the first part. Ahikhar (<a href="../bible/tob014.htm#vrs10">14:10</a>) is Achior (<a href="../bible/tob002.htm#vrs10">2:10</a>); 'Edna (<a href="../bible/tob007.htm#vrs14">7:14</a>) is 'Edna (<a href="../bible/tob007.htm#vrs2">7:2</a>) 'Arag (<a href="../bible/tob009.htm#vrs2">9:2</a>) is Raga (<a href="../bible/tob004.htm#vrs1">4:1</a>, <a href="../bible/tob004.htm#vrs20">4:20</a>).</p>

<p><em>(6) Hebrew Versions</em></p>

<p>There are four Hebrew versions of this deuterocanonical story:</p>

<p>(a) HL, Hebrew Londinii, a thirteenth-century <a href="09627a.htm">manuscript</a>, found by Gaster in the British Museum, and translated by him in the "Proceedings of the Soc. of the Bibl. Archaeology" (xvii and xx). Besides a cento of <a href="13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> exhortations, this <a href="09627a.htm">manuscript</a> contains the narrative portion of Tobias, translated, Gaster thinks, from a text that stood in closest relation to the Aramaic used by <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. It is just possible, though not in the least probable, that the thirteenth-century Jewish author of HL made use of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>.</p>

<p>(c) HG, Hebrew Gasteri, a text copied by Gaster from a <a href="10286b.htm">midrash</a> on the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> and published in the "Proc. of the Soc. of Bib. Arch." (xix). This <a href="09627a.htm">manuscript</a>, now lost, agreed with the Aramaic of Neubauer and was in a compact style like that of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> recension.</p>

<p>(c) HF, Hebrew Fagii, a very free translation of AB, done in the twelfth century by a Jewish scholar: it is found in Walton's "Polyglot".</p>

<p>(d) HM, Hebrew Munsteri, published by Munster in Basle A.D. 1542, found in Walton's "Polyglot". This text agrees as a rule with Neubauer's Aramaic, even when the latter is at variance with AB. It is, according to Ginsburg, of fifth-century origin. The Hebrew versions together with the Aramaic omit reference to the dog, which plays a prominent part in the other versions.</p>

<p>The foregoing review of the various and diverse recensions of the Book of Tobias shows how hard it would be to reconstruct the original text and how easily textual <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> may have crept into our <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> or the Aramaic on which it depends.</p>

<h3 id="C">Contents</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, these references are to the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> recension, whereof the <a href="05140a.htm">Douay</a> is a translation. The story naturally divides itself into two parts:</p>

<p>(1) The fidelity of Tobias the elder and of Sara to the <a href="06608a.htm">Lord</a> (<a href="../bible/tob001.htm#vrs1">1:1</a>-<a href="../bible/tob003.htm#vrs25">3:25</a>)</p>

<h3 id="D">Purpose</h3>

<p>To show that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is faithful to those that are faithful to Him is evidently the chief purpose of the book, Neubauer (op. cit., p. xvi) makes out the burial of the dead to be the chief lesson; but the lesson of <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> is more prominent. Ewald, "Gesch. des Volkes Israel", IV, 233, sets fidelity to the <a href="10582c.htm">Mosaic code</a> as the main drift of the author, who writes for <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the <a href="04775c.htm">Dispersion</a>; but the book is meant for all <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and clearly inculcates for them many secondary lessons and one that is fundamental to the rest &#151; <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is true to those who are true to Him.</p>

<h3 id="E">Canonicity</h3>

<p><em>(1) In Judaism</em></p>

<p>The Book of Tobias is deuterocanonical, i.e. contained not in the <a href="03267a.htm">Canon</a> of Palestine but in that of Alexandria. That the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the <a href="04775c.htm">Dispersion</a> accepted the book as canonical <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> is clear from its place in the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>. That the Palestinian <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> reverenced Tobias as a sacred book may be argued from the <a href="05543b.htm">existence</a> of the Aramaic translation used by <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and that published by Neubauer, as also from the four extant Hebrew translators. Then, most of these <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a> version were found as <a href="10286b.htm">Midrashim</a>, or hagganda, of the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>.</p>

<p><em>(2) Among Christians</em></p>

<p>Despite the rejection of Tobias from the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="03267a.htm">Canon</a>, its place in the <a href="03267a.htm">Christian Canon of Holy Writ</a> is undoubted. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has ever esteemed it as inspired.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul> <li><a href="12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> (A.D. 117), "Ad Philippenses", x, urges <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, and cites <a href="../bible/tob004.htm#vrs10">Tobit 4:10</a>, and <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs9">12:9</a>, as authority for his urging. </li><li>Deutero-Clement (A.D. 150), "Ad Corinthios", xvi, has praises of <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> that are an echo of <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs8">Tobit 12:8-9</a>. </li><li><a href="04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a> (A.D. 190-210), in <a href="../fathers/02106.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VI.12</a>, cites as the words of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a> "<a href="05789c.htm">Fasting</a> is <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> with <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>" (<a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs9">Tobit 12:9</a>); and in <a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.21</a> and <a href="../fathers/02102.htm">II.23</a>, "What thou hatest, do not unto another" (<a href="../bible/tob004.htm#vrs16">Tobit 4:16</a>). </li><li><a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (about A.D. 230) cites as <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> <a href="../bible/tob003.htm#vrs24">Tobit 3:24</a> and <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs12">12:12-15</a>, in "De oratione", II; <a href="../bible/tob002.htm#vrs1">Tobit 2:1</a>, in sec. 14; <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs12">Tobit 12:12</a>, in sec. 31 (cf. P.G., XI, 448, 461, 553); and writing to <a href="08565a.htm">Africanus</a> (P.G., XI, 80) he explains that, although the Hebrews do not use Tobias, yet the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> does. </li><li><a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> (A.D. 350) uses <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs7">Tobit 12:7</a> and <a href="../bible/tob004.htm#vrs19">4:19</a>, with the distinctive phrase "as it is written", cf. "Apol. contra arianos", II, and "Apol. ad Imper. Constantium" (P.G., XXV, 268, 616). </li><li>In the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (about A.D. 248) very often refers to Tobias as of Divine authority just as he refers to other books of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a>; cf. "De mortalitate", x; "De opere et eleemosynis", v, xx; "De patientia", xviii (P.G., IV, 588, 606, 634); "Ad Quirinum", i, 20 for <a href="../bible/tob012.htm">Tobit 12</a>; iii, 1 for <a href="../bible/tob002.htm#vrs2">Tobit 2:2</a>; and iv, 5-11; ii, 62 for <a href="../bible/tob004.htm#vrs12">Tobit 4:12</a> (P.G., IV, 689, 728, 729, 767). </li><li><a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (about A.D. 370) wrote a book entitled "De Tobia" against <a href="15235c.htm">usury</a> (P.L., XIV, 759), and introduced it by referring to the <a href="../bible.html">Biblical</a> work of that name as "a prophetic book", "Scripture". </li><li>In the entire <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, however, the canonicity of Tobias is clearest from its presence in the Old Latin Version, the <a href="02137a.htm">authentic</a> text of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> for the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> from about A.D. 150 until <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> replaced it. </li><li>The canonical use of Tobias in that part of the <a href="04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> whose language was <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a> is seen in the writings of <a href="05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a> (about A.D. 362) and of St. Archelaus (about A.D. 278). </li><li>The earliest canonical lists all contain the Book of Tobias; they are those of the <a href="01199a.htm">Council of Hippo</a> (A.D. 393), the Councils of Carthage (A.D. 397 and 419), St. Innocent I (A.D. 405), <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (A.D. 397). </li><li>Moreover, the great fourth- and fifth- century <a href="09627a.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> are <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that not only the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> but the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> used Tobias as canonical. </li><li>For the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> the question of the canonicity of Tobias was <a href="07790a.htm">infallibly</a> settled by the decisions of the Councils of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a>, Session IV (8 April, 1546) and of the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican</a>, Session III, ch. 2 (24 April, 1870).</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Against the canonicity of Tobias are urged several rather trivial objections which would at first sight seem to impugn the inspiration of the narrative.</p>

<p>(a) <a href="12640b.htm">Raphael</a> told an <a href="05781a.htm">untruth</a> when he said he was "Azarias the son of the great Ananias" (<a href="../bible/tob005.htm#vrs18">5:18</a>). There is no <a href="05781a.htm">untruth</a> in this. The <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> was in appearance just what he said he was. Besides, he may have meant by <em>azaryah</em>, "the healer of Jah"; and by <em>ananyah</em>, "the goodness of Jah". In this event he only told the young Tobias that he was <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> helper and the offspring of the great <a href="06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; in this there would be no <a href="05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<p>(b) A second objection is that the angelology of Tobias is taken over from that of the <a href="02151b.htm">Avesta</a> either directly by Iranian influence or indirectly by the inroad of <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a> or Grecian folk-lore. For <a href="12640b.htm">Raphael</a> says: "I am the <a href="12640b.htm">angel Raphael</a>, one of the seven who stand before the Lord" (<a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs15">12:15</a>). These seven are the Amesha Spentas of <a href="02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a>: cf. Fritzsche, "Exegetisches Handbuch zu den Apocr.", II (Leipzig, 1853), 61. The answer is that the reading <em>seven</em> is <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>; it is in <em>Aleph</em>, AB, Old Latin, and Vulgate; it is wanting in the Greek cursive text, <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a>, and HM. Still, admitting the reading of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, the Amesha Spentas have infiltrated into <a href="02151b.htm">Avestic religion</a> from the seven <a href="01476d.htm">Angels</a> of Hebraistic Revelation and not vice versa. Moreover, there are not seven Amesha Spentas in the angelology of the <a href="02151b.htm">Avesta</a>, but only six. They are subordinated to <a href="01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a>, the first principle of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a>. <a href="15073a.htm">True</a>, he is, at times, grouped with the six lower <a href="14220b.htm">spirits</a> as seven Amesha Spentas; but in this grouping we have not by any means seven <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> standing before the <a href="04683a.htm">Deity</a>.</p>

<h3 id="F">Historical worth</h3>

<p><em>(1) To Protestants</em></p>

<p>The destructive criticism which, among <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, has striven to do away with the canonical books of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> have quite naturally had no respect for those books the critics call <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. The Book of Tobias is to them no more than are the Testament of Job, the <a href="08535a.htm">Book of Jubilees</a>, and the story of Ahikhar. From the standpoint of <a href="04503a.htm">historical criticism</a> it is to be grouped with these three <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> (J.T. Marshall, Principal of the Baptist College, Manchester, in Hasting's "Dict. of the Bible", s.v.). Simrock in "Der gute Gerhard und die dankbaren Todten" (Bonn, 1858) reduces the story to the folk-lore theme of the gratitude of the departed <a href="14220b.htm">spirit</a>; the yarn is spun out of this slim thread of fancy that the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead, whose remains Tobias buried, did not forget his benevolence. Erbt (Encycl. Biblica, s.v.) finds traces of Iranian legend in the name of the <a href="04710a.htm">demon</a> <a href="01792c.htm">Asmodeus</a> (<a href="../bible/tob003.htm#vrs8">Tobit 3:8</a>) which is the Persian <em>Aeshma daeva</em>; as also in the dog &#151; "with the <a href="11712a.htm">Persians</a> a certain power over <a href="04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> was assigned to the dog." And again: "the <a href="08386a.htm">Jewish nation</a> takes up a foreign legend, goes on repeating it until it has got it into fixed oral form, in order next to pass it on to some story-writer who is able to shape it into an edifying household tale, capable of ministering comfort to many succeeding generations." Moulton, "The Iranian background of Tobit" (Expository Time, 1900, p. 257), considers the book to be Median folk-lore, in which the <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a> and Iranian elements meet.</p>

<p>On the Ahikhar story, cf. "The Story of Ahikhar from the Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, Ethiopic, Greek, and Slavonic versions" by Conybeare, Harris, and Mrs. Smith, a work which will be brought back to 407 B.C. in a new edition soon to appear (Expositor, March 1912, p. 212).</p>

<p><em>(2) To Catholics</em></p>

<p>Until recently there never was question among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in regard to the historicity of Tobias. It was among the historical books of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the Fathers had always referred to both elder and younger Tobias and to the other personages of the narratives as to facts and not to fancies. The stories of <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, <a href="03071a.htm">burial</a> of the dead, angelophany, <a href="05709a.htm">exorcism</a>, marriage of Sara with Tobias the younger, cure of the elder Tobias &#151; all these incidents were taken for granted as fact-narrative; nor was there ever any question of likening them to the tales of "The Arabian Nights" and the "Fables of &AElig;sop". Jahn, "Introductio in libros sacros", 2nd ed. (Vienna, 1814), 452, gives the stock objections to the historicity of Tobias, and suggests that either the entire composition is a <a href="11460a.htm">parable</a> to teach that the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the upright are heard or at most only the main outline is fact-narrative. His book was put on the Index (26 Aug., 1822). Anton Scholz, "Die heilige Schrift", II, iii, p. 12, and <a href="10606a.htm">Movers</a> in "Kirchenlexicon" (first ed., I, p. 481) hold that Tobias is a poetic fiction. Cosquin, in "Revue biblique" (1899, pp. 50-82), tries to show that the sacred writer of Tobias had before his eyes a form of the Ahikhar story and worked it over rather freely as a vehicle to carry the inspired thought of the moral he wished to convey to his readers. Barry, "The Tradition of Scripture" (New York, 1906), p. 128, says: "Its relation to other stories, such as <em>The Grateful Dead</em> and the tale of <em>Ahichar</em>, has been used in illustration of the romantic nature ascribed to it by modern readers; so, too, the symbolical names of its personages, and the borrowings, as they say, from <a href="11712a.htm">Persian</a> mythology of <a href="01792c.htm">Asmodeus</a>, etc." Gigot, "Special introduction to the study of the Old Testament", I (New York, 1901), 343-7, gives at length the arguments in favour of the non-historical character of the book and attempts no refutation of the same.</p>

<p>With these and a few other exceptions, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05692b.htm">exegetes</a> are unanimous in clearly defending the historicity of Tobias. Cf. <a href="15587a.htm">Welte</a> in "Kirchenlexikon" (first ed., s.v. <em>Tobias</em>); Reusch, "Das Buch Tobias", p. vi; Vigouroux, "Manuel biblique", II (Paris, 1883), 134; <a href="04378a.htm">Cornely</a>, "Introd. in utriusque testamenti libros sacros", II (Paris, 1887), i, 378; Danko, "Hist. revelationis v.t.", 369; Haneburg, "Gesch. der bibl. Offenbarung" (3rd ed., Ratisbon, 1863), 489; <a href="08611a.htm">Kaulen</a>, "Einleitung in die heilige Schrift" (Freiburg, 1890), 215; Zschokke, "Hist. sacra A.T.", 245; Seisenberger, "Practical Handbook for the Study of the Bible" (New York, 1911), 343. This almost unanimity among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05692b.htm">exegetes</a> is quite in keeping with the decision of the <a href="02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a> (23 June, 1905). By this <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are forbidden to hold that a book of the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a>, which has generally been looked upon as historical, is either entirely or in part not history properly so called, unless it be <a href="12454c.htm">proven</a> by solid arguments that the sacred writer did not wish to write history; and the solidity of the arguments against the historicity of an historical book of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> we are not to admit either readily or rashly. Now the arguments against the historical worth of Tobias are not at all solid; they are mere conjectures, which it would be most rash to admit. We shall examine some of these conjectures.</p>

<p>(a) The Ahikhar story is not in the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> at all. As it is in AB, <em>Aleph</em>, and the Old Latin, <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> undoubtedly <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> it. Why did he follow the Aramaic text to the exclusion of this episode? He may have looked upon it as an interpolation, which was not written by the inspired author. Even though it were not an interpolation, the Ahikhar episode of Tobias has not been <a href="12454c.htm">proven</a> to be a legend drawn from a non-canonical source.</p>

<p>(b) The <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="15477a.htm">apparition</a> and all incidents connected therewith are no more difficult to explain than the angelophanies of <a href="../bible/gen018.htm#vrs19">Genesis 18:19</a> and <a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs6">Acts 12:6</a>.</p>

<p>(c) The <a href="04713a.htm">demonology</a> is not unlike to that of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. The name "Asmodeus" need not be of Iranian origin; but may just as readily be explained as <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a>. The Aramaic word <em>ashmeday</em> is cognate with the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>hashmed</em>, "destruction". And even though it be a mutilated form of some Iranian ancestor of the Persian <em>Aeshma daeva</em>, what more natural than a Median name for a <a href="04710a.htm">demon</a> whose obsession was accomplished upon Median soil? The slaying of the seven husbands was allowed by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in punishment of their <a href="09438a.htm">lust</a> (<a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, v. 16); it is the youth Tobias, not the sacred writer, that suggests (according to AB, <em>Aleph</em>, and Old Latin) the <a href="04710a.htm">demon's</a> <a href="09438a.htm">lust</a> as the motive of his killing all rivals. The binding of the <a href="04764a.htm">devil</a> in the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> of Upper <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the farthest end of the then known world (<a href="../bible/tob008.htm#vrs3">8:3</a>), has the same figurative meaning as the binding of <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a> for a thousand years (<a href="../bible/rev020.htm#vrs2">Revelation 20:2</a>).</p>

<p>(d) The unlikelihood of the many coincidences in the Book of Tobias is mere conjecture (cf. Gigot, op. cit., 345). <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> may have brought about these siimilarities of incident, with a view to the use of them in an inspired book.</p>

<p>(e) Certain historical difficulties are due to the very imperfect condition in which the text has reached us.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul> <li>It was Theglathphalasar III who led <a href="10749a.htm">Nephthali</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki015.htm#vrs29">2 Kings 15:29</a>) into captivity (734 B.C.), and not, as Tobias says (<a href="../bible/tob001.htm#vrs2">1:2</a>), Salmanasar. Yet this reading of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, Old Latin, and Aramaic is to be corrected by the name Enemesar of AB and <em>Aleph</em>. The latter reading would be equivalent to the Hebrew transliteration of the Assyrian <em>kenum sar</em>. As the appellative <em>sar</em> "king", may precede or follow a personal name, <em>kenum sar</em> is <em>sar kenum</em>, that is Gargon (<em>sarru-kenu</em> II, B.C. 722). It can readily be that, twelve years after Theglath-phalasar III began the deportation of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of <a href="13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, Sardon's scouts completed the work and routed some of the tribe of <a href="10749a.htm">Nephthali</a> from their fastnesses. </li><li>A like solution is to be given to the difficulty that Sennacherib is said to have been the son of Salmanasar (<a href="../bible/tob001.htm#vrs18">1:18</a>), whereas he was the son of the usurper Sargon. The <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> reading here, as in <a href="../bible/tob001.htm#vrs2">1:2</a>, should be that of AB and <em>Aleph</em>, to wit, Enemesar; and this stands for Sargon. </li><li>In B, <a href="../bible/tob014.htm#vrs15">14:15</a>, Ninive is said to have been captured by Ahasuerus (<em>Asoueros</em>) and <a href="10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>. This is a mistake of the scribe. <em>Aleph</em> reads that Achiacharos took Ninive and adds that "he praised <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for all He had done against the children of Ninive and <a href="02007c.htm">Assyria</a>". The word for <a href="02007c.htm">Assyria</a> is <em>Athoureias</em>, Hebrew <em>asshur</em>, Aramaic <em>ahur</em>: This Greek word mislead the scribe to write <em>Lsyeros</em> for the name of the king, <em>Achiacharos</em>, i.e. the Median King Cyaxares. According to Berossus, Cyaxares was, in his campaign against Ninive, allied to the <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> King Nabopalassar, the father of <a href="10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>; the scribe of V has written the name for the son for that of the father, as Nabopalassar was unknown to him. </li><li>Rages is a <a href="13690a.htm">Seleucid</a> town and hence an anachronism. Not at all; it is an ancient Median town, which the <a href="13690a.htm">Seleucids</a> restored.</li></ul></div>

<h3 id="G">Origin</h3>

<p>It is likely that the elder Tobias wrote at least that part of the original work in which he uses the first <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> singular, cf. <a href="../bible/tob001.htm#vrs1">1:1</a>-<a href="../bible/tob003.htm#vrs6">3:6</a>, in all texts except the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> and Aramaic. As the entire narrative is historical, this part is probably autobiographical. After revealing his <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>, <a href="12640b.htm">Raphael</a> bade both father and son to tell all the wonders that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> had done them (<a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs20">12:20</a>) and to write in a book all the incidents of his stay with them (cf. same verse in AB, <em>Aleph</em>, Old Latin, HF, and HM). If we accept the story as fact-narrative, we naturally conclude that it was written originally during the <a href="03315a.htm">Babylonian Exile</a>, in the early portion of the seventh century B.C.; and that all save the last chapter was the work of the elder and younger Tobias. Almost all <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scholars consider the book post-Exilic. Ewald assigns it to 350 B.C.; Hgen, the bulk to 280 B.C.; <a href="06732a.htm">Gratz</a>, to A.D. 130; Kohut, to A.D. 226.</p>
