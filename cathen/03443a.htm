<p>Born 13 April, 1519; died 5 January, 1589. She was the daughter of Lorenzo de' Medici (II), Duke of <a href="15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, and Madeleine de la Tour d' Auvergne who, by her mother, Catherine of Bourbon, was related to the royal house of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<p>Left an <a href="11322b.htm">orphan</a> when only a few weeks old, Catherine had barely reached the age of thirteen when <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I, King of France</a>, eager to thwart the projects of the <a href="03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> and to court the friendship of <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, Catherine's uncle, arranged a marriage between Catherine and his second son Henry, <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> coming to <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in October, 1533, for the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. The death, however, of the <a href="12260a.htm">pontiff</a> during the ensuing year prevented <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a> from realizing the political advantages he had hoped for from this union. Having brought to the French court only 100,000 <em>&eacute;cus</em> and a few poor appanages, Catherine was relegated to the background, where she remained even when, on the death of her husband's elder brother, she attained the dignity of Dauphiness. Obliged to continue in this comparative obscurity for ten years because of being childless, her entire policy meanwhile consisted in trying to retain the favour of Diane de Poitiers, her husband's mistress, and of the Duchesse d'Etampes, mistress of <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a>. On the accession of Henry II, 31 March, 1547, Catherine became Queen of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, but she still remained inconspicuous, except during Henry's short campaign in <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, when she acted as regent, and even then showed her political abilities.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It was only on Henry II's death, 10 July, 1559, that Catherine's political career really began. Her son Francis II, husband of <a href="09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, was king, and the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a>, <a href="09764a.htm">Mary Stuart's</a> uncles, were in power, a condition that overtaxed Catherine's patience. The <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> relied on her because everyone <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> that the psalms of Marot had always delighted her, and that she had recently promised the Prince de Conde and the Admiral de Coligny, who were <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> leaders, liberty and security for their followers. But the intriguing <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> developed a State within the State in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and Castelnau tells us that at their <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> they were urged to adopt "all means of self defence and attack, of furnishing money to military men and making attempts upon cities and fortresses". Catherine was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to allow the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a> to quell the conspiracy of Amboise, March, 1560, and for a few months to exercise a sort of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dictatorship. Then to check and paralyze their power, she appointed Michel de l'H&ocirc;pital chancellor, a man whose wife and children were <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, and convoked an assembly of notables at Fontainebleau (August, 1560) at which it was decided that the punishment of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be suspended, and that the States General, from which religious peace was looked for, were to meet at <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in December. Meanwhile Francis II died, 5 December, 1560.</p>

<p>Catherine's policy remained just what it had been during Francis' brief reign. She continued to oscillate between the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="07527b.htm">Protestants</a> in order to establish the dominion of the royal family, and was forever manoeuvring between <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, whose queen, Elizabeth, she sought at certain times as a daughter in law, and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, whose king, <a href="12002a.htm">Philip II</a>, was her son in law. Thus did Catherine strive to insure the independence and political self government of French royalty. As Charles IX, Catherine's second son and the successor of Francis II, was scarcely ten years old, Catherine was regent and virtually sovereign. She named Anthony of Bourbon, King of <a href="10721a.htm">Navarre</a> and a <a href="07527b.htm">Protestant</a>, lieutenant general of the kingdom, increased l'Hopital's power, inflicted upon the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a> a sort of political defeat by imposing an obstacle to the marriage of <a href="09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a> with Don Carlos, son of Philip II, and convoked the conference of Poissy in an endeavour to bring about a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> understanding between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>. "It is impossible", she wrote to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, "to reduce either by arms or law those who are separated from the <a href="13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, so large is their number". She also opposed her son in law, <a href="12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, who demanded severity against the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>, and the edict of January, 1562, insured them toleration. The political interests that helped to set the religious factions at variance did not abate: the arrogance of the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> exasperated the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the Vassy massacre (March, 1562) opened the first religious <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, which fact alone was a victory for the <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> policy and a defeat for that of the regent. At one time Catherine thought of taking sides with Conde against the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a>, and accordingly wrote him four letters, which the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> subsequently claimed to have contained her orders to Conde to take up arms, but which Catherine declared had been altered. Events then occurred in rapid succession, and she had the humiliation of seeing <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> bring Charles IX back to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>.</p>

<p>Thenceforth Catherine fluctuated between the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> forces. She negotiated and watched the intrigues of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> when it would interfere in behalf of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> when it would interest itself in the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>; and of the emperor who took advantage of <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="01452a.htm">anarchy</a> to reclaim the three <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> recently conquered by Henry II. The <a href="15108a.htm">assassination</a> of <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> by the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenot</a>, Poltrot de Mere (18 February, 1563), hastened the hour of peace, and when the treaty of Amboise (12 March, 1563) had granted certain liberties to <a href="07527b.htm">Protestants</a>, Catherine, to show <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> that discord no longer existed in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> sent both <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="07527b.htm">Protestants</a> to recover Le Havre (28 July, 1563), which Admiral de Coligny had yielded to the English. It was indeed a great period in Catherine's life: Charles IX who had attained his majority on the 27th of June solemnly declared to her that she should govern more than ever; the treaty with <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, 11 April, 1564, assured Calais to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; and Catherine and the young king made a tour of the provinces. The <a href="02360b.htm">Bayonne</a> interview between Catherine and the Duke of Alba (June, 1565) caused a renewal of trouble; the <a href="07527b.htm">Protestants</a> spread the rumour that the queen mother had conspired against them with the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and a serious resort to arms was under way. For Catherine's growing <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of Coligny; her fear lest Charles IX, susceptible to certain <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> influence, should ally himself with the Prince of Orange and wage <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>; her order for the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> of Coligny what she might regain her control over Charles IX; and finally, for the connection of Coligny's <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> with the <a href="13333b.htm">massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day</a> and Catherine's responsibility in the matter see the article <a href="13333b.htm">ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S DAY</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Charles IX died 30 May, 1574, and Henry, Duke of Anjou, whom Catherine had but lately made King of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, became King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. She was very fond of this third son, but had only a limited influence over him. The concessions which he made to <a href="07527b.htm">Protestants</a> in the treaty known as the "Peace of Monsieur" (5 May, 1576) brought about the formation of the <a href="09098b.htm">Holy League</a> for the protection of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. For twelve years the power of the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> was constantly on the increase, the relentless <a href="15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> serving only to fortify it, and as a consequence Catherine suffered cruelly. Surrounded by his favourites, Henry III let his dynasty fall into disrepute. Francis of Valois, Catherine's youngest son, died 10 June, 1584, and Henry III being without issue, Henry of Bourbon, a <a href="07527b.htm">Protestant</a> (the future <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>), fell heir to the crown of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. And now the discouraged queen mother and the childless king saw <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> become the bone of contention between the <a href="09098b.htm">League</a> and the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> party; the royal family of Valois, doomed to extinction, watched the struggle as would supernumeraries assisting at a theatrical performance. Catherine, ever ambitious, laid claim to the crown of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> for a member of her <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, and dreamed in vain of giving the crown of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to her daughter's son, the Marquis de Pont a Mousson; but the matter rested between the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a> and the Bourbons. At the close of 1587 the real master of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> was no longer Henry III, but the Duke of <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a>, and on the "Day of the Barricades" (12 May, 1588) Catherine saved her son's <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> by going in person to negotiate with <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> who received her as would a conqueror. She thus gained time for Henry III to fly secretly from <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and then she provisionally reconciled Henry III and Henry of Guise by the "Edict of Union" (July, 1588). This intriguing <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>, who used these means to prolong the wearing of the crown by a Valois, was at Blois with her son, Henry III, for the meeting of the States General, when she learned, on 23 December, 1588, that through assassination Henry III had rid himself of <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a>. Her surprise was tragic. "You have cut out, my son, but you must sew together", she exclaimed upon hearing the news, and thirteen days later she died in despair at leaving her son in this critical situation. It was soon ended, however, when, on 1 August, 1589, the dagger of Jacques Clement cut short Henry's earthly existence. Catherine had always placed the interests of her children and her <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> first, and she died oppressed with anxiety whether this last representative would remain king of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> until his death.</p>

<p>Dictatorial, unscrupulous, calculating, and crafty, the subtlety of her policy harassed all parties concerned and perhaps contributed to the aggravation of discord, although Catherine herself was peaceably inclined. Moreover, being intensely <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a>, she surrounded herself with <a href="02018e.htm">astrologers</a>. But she was sadly wanting in strong religious <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and acted in favour of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> only because in so doing she saw some advantage to her crown. There was never any joint interest between the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and Catherine's religious policy. Indeed her methods were so essentially egotistical as to border on cynicism, and it was because the interests of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and of royalty were at that time identical that Catherine, in working for her children, incidentally rendered direct political service to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and, for thirty years, prevented foreigners from interfering with, or exploiting, its religious discords. Despite her many cares she found leisure in which to enrich the Bibliotheque Royale, to have Philibert Delorme erect the Tuileries, and Pierre Lescot build the Hotel de Soissons. In a word she was a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> of the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, a disciple of <a href="09501a.htm">Machiavelli</a>, and the objective point of her policy may be perceived when we remember that she was a mother, <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a>.</p>
