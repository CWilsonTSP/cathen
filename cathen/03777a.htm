<p>The <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, like the Greek (<em>peritome</em>), and the Latin (<em>circumcisio</em>), signifies a cutting and, specifically, the removal of the prepuce, or foreskin, from the penis. The number and variety of tribes and nations who practised it are surprising; a conservative estimate places the number that practise it in our day at two hundred millions. Herodotus says that the Egyptians, Colchians, and Ethiopians, from very early times, were circumcised; and he mentions other races, the <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a> and Syrians of Palestine (the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a> maintains), who say that they learned the use of circumcision from the Egyptians (Herod., II, 104; Jos., C. Ap., I, 22). Even some <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> circumcise their children, the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>, for instance, and the <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>, in Africa; and among the Filipinos, the same may be said of most of the Tagalos, who are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. To these last, however, it is a mere <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> without religious import. The <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> Moros may have introduced it into the islands, where it remains, notwithstanding centuries of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> influence against it (C. N. Barney, see bibliography). The <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> are entirely under Jewish influence, though they profess <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>: they observe the Jewish <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, circumcise on the eighth day, and observe many other usages. (See Andree, cited below, p. 189.) Andree states also that the custom of circumcising is found in Sumatra (pp. 191, 192), the east coast of <a href="10783a.htm">New Guinea</a> (p. 197), and among the Samoans, who call <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a> "the uncircumcised". Even in America, circumcision was in use among the <a href="02169b.htm">Aztec</a> and Maya races (op. cit. 201, 202). The fact of its existence in Australia (Spencer and Gillen, Tribes of Central Australia, p. 218 sq.), and in a great part of the islands of Oceanica, not to speak of America, would seem to throw some <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> on the assertion of Herodotus that it had its origin in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It is not easy to assign satisfactory reasons for a usage so general. Those who think it was a tribal mark, like tattooing, or the knocking out of the front teeth, should consider that such marks are usually conspicuous. Was it connected with phallic worship, and thus regarded as an offering to the deity of fertility? or was it, as some think, a substitute for human sacrifice? From the fact that the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were, beyond question, circumcised (G. Rawlinson &#151; Ancient <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, vol. I, p. 452), as also from the fact that the upper classes among the <a href="02169b.htm">Aztec</a> and Celebes tribes made use of it, we may conclude that circumcision was not looked upon as a mark of slavery or subjection, but rather of nobility and superiority. Father Lagrange holds that it had a religious significance, and that, as it is not referred to in Chaldean monuments, it was not a protosemitic practice, but may have had its origin in Arabia (Etudes sur les <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> s&eacute;mitiques, 1903, pp. 239-243).</p>

<p>Merely <a href="15241c.htm">utilitarian</a> motives have been assigned by many: even <a href="12023a.htm">Philo</a> (De Circumcisione, II, 211, ed. Mangey) gives cleanliness, freedom from disease, offspring, and purity of heart, this last the only mystical or sacramental one among the four, which Herodotus also mentions as the motive of the Egyptians, <em>kathariotetos eineka</em> (II, 37). Physicians prescribe circumcision in certain cases, for instance, to guard against phimosis, balanitis, and other such evils; further, Rosenzweig recommended its general adoption in the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> army (Zur Beschneidungsfrage, 1878). That the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> had some relation to initiation into manhood, at the marriageable age, seems to receive support from the custom of certain tribes of being circumcised at the age of puberty; and also from the fact that the Arabic word <em>khatan</em> signifies to circumcise and to be allied by marriage.</p>

<p>It is strange that the universal practice of circumcision among those who profess <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> is neither based upon, nor sanctioned by, the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a>. Was this silence observed by the <a href="10424a.htm">Prophet of Islam</a> because there was no need of prescribing what already had the force of law or, perhaps, because it did not seem to him to have any religious significance? However we explain his silence, tradition, by appealing to his authority, soon gave to the practice all the weight of his sanction. The age at which the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> were circumcised was, according to <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Ant., I, xii, 2), thirteen years, in imitation of Ismael (Gen. xvii, 25). At present the regular time for circumcising <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> children is between the ages of seven and twelve years. The Bedouin tribes too, though not scrupulous <a href="10424a.htm">Islamites</a>, have adhered faithfully to this usage of their forefathers. A short description of the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of circumcision among the nomads of the Sinaitic peninsula may be read in the "Palestine Exploration Fund, Quarterly Statement" (Jan., 1906, p. 28). The writer says that the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> has "nothing religious" about it: yet, as he states, the beginning of the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a> is recited on the occasion.</p>

<p>The relation, if there be any, between <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> and Jewish circumcision is an interesting subject. The clear statement of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> that circumcision was given to Abraham, as "a sign of the covenant" (Gen. xvii, 11), need not compel us to believe that hitherto it was unknown in the world. Like the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="04010c.htm">clean and unclean</a>, in food and daily life, it may be regarded as a practice of venerable antiquity that was adopted and adapted to express what it had not expressed before. The rainbow existed from the first days of rain and sunshine, for it is the result of both, but the Lord gave its future significance to <a href="11088a.htm">Noah</a>. The same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="07716a.htm">incense</a>, sacrifice, and lustral water, which, though found very early among nations not in touch with revelation, are yet prescribed by Divine ordinance and used in Divine worship. If, therefore, we question the assertion of Herodotus, that circumcision was of <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin, and was adopted from the Egyptians by surrounding nations, and, among these, by the Syrians. (<a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>) of Palestine, it is not because of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> scruples, but rather because of lack of argument. Whatever may be said about Herodotus as a <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> in matters that fell under his personal observation, when he argues, his authority is only in proportion to the weight of his arguments, and these are, in many instances, mere conjectures. Artapanus, quoted by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (Pr&aelig;par. Evan., IX, xxviii), goes so far as to say that the Egyptians adopted the practice of circumcision from Moses.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The illustration of the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of circumcision pictured on the ruins of Karnak, is probably later than the going down of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a> into <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. It is given in Andree's work, pp. 187, 188 (see below); and also in Ebers, "Aegypten etc.", pp. 278-284 (see below), who, moreover, discusses the inferences to be drawn from the finding of a circumcised mummy. We may safely say, however, that up to our time the monuments of antiquity furnish no conclusive <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that circumcision was practised anywhere prior to the Biblical date, at which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> made it "a sign of the covenant" between Himself and Abraham (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#vrs11">Genesis 17:11</a>). To the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> it had a sacramental meaning, derived from its Divine institution and sanction. As Isaac, so their children were circumcised on the eighth day, according to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>: "An infant of eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations: he that is born in the house, as well as the bought servant shall be circumcised, and whosoever is not of your stock: And my covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant. The male, whose flesh of his foreskin shall not be circumcised, that <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be destroyed out of his people: because he hath broken my covenant" (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#vrs12">Genesis 17:12-14</a>; <a href="../bible/gen021.htm#vrs4">21:4</a>). For some reason, not given in the text, Moses while in <a href="09513b.htm">Madian</a> neglected to circumcise his son, Eliezer, on which account <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> "would have killed him", i.e. not Eliezer, as some think, but Moses, as the passage indicates. Sephora, having taken a sharp stone, circumcised her son with it, and said, "a bloody spouse art thou to me"; whereupon the Lord "let him go" (<a href="../bible/exo004.htm#vrs24">Exodus 4:24-26</a>). The Greek reading, "the blood of my son's circumcision has ceased to flow", is obscure. Sephora very probably meant that by what she had done she had saved the life of her husband and confirmed their marriage by the shedding of blood.</p>

<p>During the sojourn of forty years in the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of circumcision was not observed, as the changes incident to nomadic life, in so large a community, made its observance almost impossible. When, however, the people came into the Land of Promise, the Lord said to <a href="08524a.htm">Josue</a>: "Make thee knives of stone, and circumcise the second time the <a href="08193a.htm">children of Israel</a>" (<a href="../bible/jos005.htm#vrs2">Joshua 5:2</a>). <em>The second time</em>, i.e. renew the practice which had been omitted during the nomadic period. As Sephora used a stone knife, so on this occasion stone knives were used, which is a <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that the events narrated are of great antiquity. The words of the Lord to Josue, "This day have I taken away from you the reproach of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>", seem to refer not to circumcision, as some think, but to the disgrace of being slaves to the Egyptians, contrasted with the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of entering into the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> liberty of the children of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a> interprets them in this sense: "Now the place where Joshua pitched his camp was called 'Gilgal', which denotes 'liberty', for since now they had passed over Jordan, they looked upon themselves as freed from the miseries which they had undergone from the Egyptians, and in the wilderness" (Ant., V, i, 11). Many modern scholars, however, translate Gilgal, "a rolling away", "circle" (Gesenius, s.v.), and think that the Heb. text of Josue (v, 9), "I have rolled away from you the reproach of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>", refers to the removal of the disgrace of uncircumcision; for at that time, they suppose, most of the Egyptians, and not a few <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> while in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, were uncircumcised. The law was clear and peremptory: "The uncircumcised shall be destroyed out of his people" (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#vrs14">Genesis 17:14</a>); and for both <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> and strangers circumcision was a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> preparation for eating the <a href="08755a.htm">paschal lamb</a> (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#vrs48">Exodus 12:48</a>). <em>Arel</em>, "uncircumcised", is frequently used as a term of reproach, i.e. profane, unclean (<a href="../bible/jdg015.htm#vrs18">Judges 15:18</a>; <a href="../bible/1ki014.htm#vrs6">1 Kings 14:6</a>, <a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#vrs36">17:36</a>, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/bible/1ki031.htm#vrs4">31:4</a>; <a href="../bible/isa052.htm#vrs1">Isaiah 52:1</a>; <a href="../bible/eze028.htm#vrs10">Ezekiel 28:10</a>, <a href="../bible/eze032.htm#vrs25">32:25, 26</a>, etc.). The <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="13751a.htm">Shammai</a>, therefore, was conservative, insisting on the rigorous observance of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, while that of <a href="07354c.htm">Hillel</a>, was more inclined to leniency, in dealing with <a href="12481c.htm">proselytes</a> and strangers. <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, in the advice of Eleazer and Ananias to Izates, King of Adiabene, gives the views of the rigorists and the laxists in reference to the necessity of circumcision (Ant., XX, ii, 4; cf. Graetz, Geschichte d. Juden, III, pp. 172 sqq.). The rigorous <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was adopted by John Hyrcanus, who compelled the Idumeans to be circumcised. They received, moreover, the entire <a href="10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a>; so that <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a> says "they were hereafter no other than <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>" (Ant., XIII, ix, 1). Therefore, the fact that <a href="07289c.htm">Herod</a> was an Idumean helped him to the throne. The Itureans also were forced "to live according to the Jewish <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>" (Jos., Ant., XIII, xi, 3).</p>

<p>Long before this, many of the <a href="11712a.htm">Persians</a> were circumcised and "became <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for the fear of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> had fallen upon them" (<a href="../bible/est008.htm#vrs17">Esther 8:17</a>, Heb. text; <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, Ant., XI, 6:13). The Book of Jubilees insists upon he strict observance of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, and protests against those that "make the members of their body appear like those of the <a href="06422a.htm">gentiles</a>" (xv, 26, 27). During the period of Greek rule in Palestine, when those that kept the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of Moses were <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the <a href="06422a.htm">gentile</a> tyrants (<a href="../bible/1ma001.htm#vrs63">1 Maccabees 1:63</a>; <a href="../bible/2ma006.htm#vrs10">2 Maccabees 6:10</a>), some <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, under Greek influence, "made themselves prepuces" and turned away from the ways and traditions of their fathers (<a href="../bible/1ma001.htm#vrs15">1 Maccabees 1:15, 16</a>; Joshua Ant., XII, 5:1). To this epispastic operation performed on the athletes to conceal the marks of circumcision <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> alludes, <em>me epispastho</em> (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs18">1 Corinthians 7:18</a>). Therefore Jewish circumcision, in later times, tears the membrane that remains after circumcision given in the ordinary way, among the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> for instance, and thus defeats even the surgeon's skill.</p>

<p>In our day many <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> are not so <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> in keeping the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> as their fathers were; nor do they think it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have the "sign of the covenant" in their flesh. The <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is considered cruel, nor has it any sacramental import in Jewish national life. The Reform movement at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>, 1843, considered it an unnecessary element of <a href="08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. This lax <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> could find no stronger expression than in the case of Chief Rabbi Einhorn of Mecklenburg, who in 1847 defended his having named and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> an uncircumcised child in the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, as a child, even though uncircumcised, born of Jewish <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, enjoys all the privileges and assumes all the <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>. (See Jewish Encyl., s. vv. Circumcision, Einhorn.)</p>

<p>Neither place nor minister is designated in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of circumcision. The mother sometimes, oftener the father, circumcised the child. Later, one skilled in the operation, called a <em>Mohel</em>, usually a surgeon, performed it. In <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, Ant., XX, ii, 4, we read that Izates, the King of Adiabene, wishing to live as a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>, "sent for a surgeon" and was circumcised, evidently at home, as in modern times also the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> may take place either at home or usually in the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a>. The eighth day was prescribed, even should it be the <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> (see <a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs22">John 7:22-23</a>). A name was given, as in <a href="../bible/luk001.htm">Luke 1:59</a> and <a href="../bible/mat002.htm">2:21</a>, to commemorate the change of the patriarch's name from Abram to Abraham, when <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> made the covenant with him and made circumcision the sign of it (<a href="../bible/gen017.htm#vrs5">Genesis 17:5</a>). In the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, the one that holds the child is called <em>Sandek</em>, from the Greek <em>synteknos</em>, equivalent to our godfather in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and as Elias was a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> champion of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, for which he suffered much, there is a vacant chair for him at every circumcision.</p>

<p>The <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> were proud of their descent from Abraham, but did not always "do the works of Abraham" (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs39">John 8:39</a>). They attached so much importance to the external act, that while attending to the letter they neglected the spirit of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. Jeremias (iv, 4; ix, 25, 26) calls their attention to the necessity of circumcision of the heart, as all important. Even in <a href="../bible/deu010.htm#vrs16">Deuteronomy 10:16</a> and <a href="../bible/deu030.htm#vrs6">30:6</a>, this spiritual circumcision is set forth in no uncertain language. As uncircumcision means profane, unclean, imperfect, "I am of uncircumcised lips" (<a href="../bible/exo006.htm#vrs12">Exodus 6:12</a>), "their ears are uncircumcised" (<a href="../bible/jer006.htm#vrs10">Jeremiah 6:10</a>), and was applied to inanimate things also, as in Lev., xix, 23, "the fruit that cometh forth shall be unclean [<a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> uncircumcised] to you", so to circumcise the heart (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs29">Romans 2:29</a>) means to reform the inner man, by cutting off the vices and correcting the disorders that make him displeasing in the sight of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. To leave the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a> was to give up that which more than anything else characterized it (see <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs7">Galatians 2:7-8</a>). Yet <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, while showing his freedom from the legalities of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Dispensation</a> by not circumcising Titus (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs3">Galatians 2:3</a>), wished to bury the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a> with <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> by subjecting Timothy to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of circumcision (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs3">Acts 16:3</a>). Even though <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, as a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> son of Abraham, submitted to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, His followers were to be children of Abraham by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and were to "adore the Father in spirit and in <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh004.htm#vrs23">John 4:23</a>). The Council of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> decided against the necessity of the rite, and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, in his Epistle to the Galatians, condemns the teachers that wished to make the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ only a continuation of the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: "Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing" (v, 2). Here he refers to the supposed efficacy and necessity of circumcision, rather than to the mere <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>; for he did not consider it wrong to circumcise Timothy. It was wrong, however, for the Galatians, having been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and having taken upon themselves the <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of Christ with all its privileges, to be circumcised as a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since, by going for <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to the <a href="14379b.htm">Synagogue</a>, they virtually denied the sufficiency of the merits of Christ (cf. <a href="12075c.htm">Piconio</a>, "Trip. Exp. in Gal.", v, 2). The Apostle gives the essence of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> when he says: "In <a href="08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> that worketh by charity" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs6">Galatians 5:6</a>). In <a href="../bible/rom004.htm">Romans 4</a>, he shows that Abraham was justified by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, before circumcision was given as a sign of the covenant; so that the uncircumcision of the New Law is the continuation of the first ages of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> upon the earth. The <a href="06422a.htm">gentile</a> church of uncircumcision, according to <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, is composed of men from the time of Abel the Just to the end of ages (Hom. xix in Evan.). <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> also says that as Henoch and the just of old received the spiritual circumcision, so do we receive it in the <a href="02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a> (<a href="../fathers/01283.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 43</a>).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> holds that circumcision was a figure of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>: this retrenches and restrains the animal man as that removed a part of his body &#151; which physical act indicated the spiritual effect of the sacrament (De Sac., Summa, III, Q. lxx, a. 1). He gives three reasons why the organ of generation rather than any other was to be circumcised:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Abraham was to be <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a> in his seed;</li><li>The rite was to take away <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>, which comes by generation;</li><li>It was to restrain <a href="04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, which is found especially in the generative organs (III, Q. lxx, a. 3).</li></ul></div>

<p>According to his teaching, as <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> remits <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> and actual <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> committed before its reception, so circumcision remitted both, but <em>ex opere operantis</em>, i.e. by the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the recipient, or, in the case of infants, by the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>. Infants that died before being circumcised could be saved, as were those who lived prior to the institution of circumcision, and as <a href="15687b.htm">females</a> were even after its institution, by some sign &#151; the <a href="11478c.htm">parents'</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, for instance &#151; expressive of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. Adults did not receive the remission of all the temporal punishment due to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> as in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>: &#151; "Adulti, quando circumcidebantur, consequebantur remissionem, non solum originalis peccati, sed etiam actualium peccatorum; non tamen ita quod liberarentur ab omni reatu p n&aelig;, Sicut in baptismo, in quo confertur copiosior gratia" (III, Q. lxx, a. 4). The main points of the teaching of the <a href="14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a> were commonly held in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, even before the days of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who with other Fathers maintained that circumcision was not a mere <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, but a sacramental rite. (Cf. <a href="../fathers/120116.htm"><em>City of God</em> XVI.27</a>)</p>
