<p>(UGOLINO, Count of Segni).</p>

<p>Born about 1145, at <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a> in the Campagna; died 22 August, 1241, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He received his <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> at the Universities of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna. After the accession of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne, Ugolino, who was a nephew of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, was successively appointed <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, Archpriest of St. Peter's, and <a href="03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of Saint' Eustachio in 1198. In May, 1206, he succeeded Octavian as <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia and Velletri</a>. A year later he and Cardinal Brancaleone were sent as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a> to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> to mediate between Philip of Swabia and Otto of Brunswick, both of whom laid claim to the German throne subsequent to the death of <a href="07233a.htm">Henry VI</a>. By order of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> freed Philip from the ban which he had incurred under <a href="03478b.htm">Pope Celestine III</a> on account of invading the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>. Though the <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> were unable to induce Otto of Brunswick to give up his claims to the throne, they succeeded in effecting a truce between the two claimants and returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1208 to treat with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> concerning their future procedure. On their way back to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> early in June, 1208, they were apprised at <a href="15360a.htm">Verona</a> that Philip had been <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>, and again returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Early in January, 1209, they again proceeded to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> with instructions to induce the princes to acknowledge Otto of Brunswick as king. They were successful in their mission and returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in June of the same year. After the death of <a href="08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, 16 July, 1216, Ugolino was instrumental in the election of Pope <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> on 18 July. In order to hasten the choice the <a href="03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> had agreed to an election by compromise and empowered Cardinals Ugolino and Guido of Preneste to appoint the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In January, 1217, <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> made Ugolino plenipotentiary <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> for <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and Tuscia, and entrusted him with preaching the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> in those territories. In this capacity he became a successful mediator between <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, in 1217, between <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="04483a.htm">Cremona</a> in 1218, and between Bologna and Pistoia in 1219. At the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 22 November, 1220, the emperor took the cross from Ugolino and made the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> to embark for the Holy Land in August, 1221. On 14 March, 1221, <a href="07452b.htm">Pope Honorius</a> commissioned Ugolino to preach the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> also in Central and Upper <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. After the death of Pope <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (18 March, 1227), the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> again agreed upon an election by compromise and empowered three of their number, among whom were Ugolino and <a href="04261a.htm">Conrad of Urach</a>, to elect the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. At first <a href="04261a.htm">Conrad of Urach</a> was elected, but he refused the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a> lest it might appear that he had elected himself. Hereupon the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> unanimously elected Ugolino on 19 March, 1227, and he reluctantly accepted the high <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, taking the name of Gregory IX. Though he was already far advanced in age (being more than eighty years old), he was still full of energy.</p>

<p>The important diplomatic positions which Gregory IX had held before he became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had acquainted him thoroughly with the political situation of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and especially with the guileful and dishonest tactics of <a href="06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>. Three days after his installation he sternly ordered the emperor at last to fulfill his long delayed <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> to embark for the Holy Land. Apparently obedient to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> mandate, <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> set sail from Brindial on 8 September, 1227, but returned three days later under the plea that the Landgrave of Thuringia, who was accompanying him, was on the point of death, and that he himself was seriously ill. Gregory IX, knowing that <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> had on eight or nine previous occasions postponed his departure for the East, distrusted the emperor's sincerity, and on 20 September, 1227, placed him under the ban of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He tried to justify his severe measures towards the emperor in a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes, while, on the other hand, the emperor addressed a manifesto to the princes in which he condemns the actions of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in very bitter terms. The imperial manifesto was read publicly on the steps of the Capitol in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whereupon the imperial party in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, under the leadership of the Frangipam, stirred up an insurrection, so that when the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> published the emperor's <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> in the <a href="13369b.htm">basilica of St. Peter</a>, 23 March, 1228, he was openly insulted and threatened by a <a href="07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> mob, and fled first to <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, and then to <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>.</p>

<p>In order to prove to the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a> that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was too hasty in placing him under the ban, the emperor resolved to proceed to the Holy Land and embarked from Brindial with a small army on 28 June, 1228, having previously asked the blessing of Gregory IX upon his enterprise. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, denying that an <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> emperor had a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to undertake a <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, not only refused his blessing, but put him under the ban a second time and released the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> from their <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to him. While in the Holy Land the emperor, seeing that he could accomplish nothing as long as he was under the ban, changed his tactics toward the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. He now acknowledged the <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> of his <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and began to take steps towards a reconciliation. Gregory IX distrusted the advances of the emperor, especially since Rainald, the imperial Governor of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, had invaded the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> during the emperor's absence. But the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="01455e.htm">anathema</a> did not have the effect which Gregory IX had hoped for. In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> only one <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Berthold of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, published the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, and nearly all the princes and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> remained faithful to the emperor. Cardinal Otto of San Nicolo, whom Gregory IX had sent to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> to publish the emperor's <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, was entirely unsuccessful, because Frederick's son Henry, his representative in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, forbade the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> to appear at the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> which the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> attempted to convene. Equally futile were Gregory's efforts to put Duke Otto of Brunswick on the German throne. In June, 1229, <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> returned from the Holy Land, routed the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> army which Gregory IX had sent to invade <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and made new overtures of peace to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Gregory IX, who had been a fugitive at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a> since 1228, returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in February, 1230, upon the urgent request of the Romans, who connected an overwhelming flood of the Tiber with their harsh treatment of the pontiff. He now opened negotiations with <a href="07267d.htm">Hermann of Salza</a>, the Grand Master of the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, whom the emperor had sent as his representative. On 20 July, 1230, a treaty was concluded at San Germano between the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor, by force of which that part of the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> which was occupied by imperial troops and the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> possessions in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> were restored to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. After the ban was removed from the emperor by Cardinals John of Sabina and Thomas of <a href="03319a.htm">Capua</a> in the imperial camp near Ceperano on 28 August, 1230, <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor met at <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a> and completed their reconciliation during the first three days of September.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The peace concluded between the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor was, however, to be only temporary. The <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> as conceived by Gregory IX and the empire as conceived by <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> could not exist together in peace. The emperor aimed at supreme temporal power with which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> should have no <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to interfere. At least in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> he tried to establish a rule of absolutism by suppressing all municipal liberty and holding the cities in subjection by a revived sort of <a href="06058c.htm">feudalism</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, on the other hand, citing the example of Constantine, who exchanged <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for Constantinople in deference to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, thought that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> should be the supreme ruler in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and by force of his spiritual authority over the whole <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a> the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> should in all things hold the supremacy over the empire. For a time the emperor assisted the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in suppressing a few minor revolts in the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, as was stipulated in the conditions of peace. Soon, however, he began again to disturb the peace by impeding the liberty of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and by making <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> upon <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. The freedom of the Lombard cities was a strong and <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> bulwark for the safety of the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> and it was only natural that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> should use all his influence to protect these cities against the imperial designs. As arbiter between the emperor and the Lombard cities the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had a few times decided in favour of the latter. The emperor, therefore, no longer desired the services of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as mediator and began open hostilities against the Lombard League. He gained a signal victory at Cortenuova on 27 November, 1237. To save <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> from the despotic rule of the emperor and to protect the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> entered into an alliance with the Tuscans, Umbrians, and Lombards to impede the imperial progress. The continuous victories of the emperor spurred his <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> to further action. He declared his intention to unite with the empire not only <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, but also the <a href="14257a.htm">Patrimony of St. Peter</a> and practically the whole of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. On 12 March, 1239, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> again <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the emperor and another disasterous struggle between the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire ensued. Henceforth the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was convinced that as long as Frederick was emperor there was no possibility of peace between the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire, and he left nothing undone to bring about his disposition. He ordered a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> to be preached against him in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, instructed his Germna <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> Albert of Behaim, the <a href="01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a>, to urge the election of a new king upon the princes, and to place under the ban all those that continued to side with the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> emperor. Despite <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="01455e.htm">anathemas</a> many <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and princes remained loyal to the emperor who, encouraged by his large following, decided to humiliate the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by making himself master of the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>. In this great distress the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered all <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to assemble in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> (31 March), 1241. But the emperor prevented the meeting of the council by forbidding the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to travel to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and by capturing all those that undertook the journey despite his prohibition. He himself marched towards <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with an army and lay encamped near the city, when Gregory IX suddenly died at the age of almost one hundred years.</p>

<p>The <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> which began to shed great lustre over the <a href="03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> in the first half of the thirteenth century found a devoted friend and liberal patron in Gregory IX. In them he saw an excellent means for counteracting by <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of luxury and splendour which was possessing many <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>; a powerful weapon for suppressing <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> within the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; and an army of <a href="06147a.htm">brave</a> soldiers of Christ who were ready to preach His Gospel to the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> even at the risk of their life. When still <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, Gregory IX would often don the dress of St. Francis, walk about barefoot with the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> and his disciples, and talk of holy things. Saint Francis <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> him as his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> and in a prophetic spirit addressed him at times as "the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the whole world and the father of all nations". Upon the special request of Saint Francis, Pope <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> appointed him protector of the order in 1220. He was also a devoted friend of <a href="05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> and promoted the interests of his order in many ways. At the death of St. Dominic he held the funeral services and buried the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> at Bologna in 1221. <a href="04004a.htm">St. Clare</a> and her order stood likewise under the protection of Gregory IX, as is attested by the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> he founded for the order in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, and Tuscia. However, despite his great liberality towards the rising <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> he did not neglect the older ones. On 28 June, 1227, he approved the old privileges of the <a href="03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>, in the same year he introduced the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> into Livonia and Courland, and on 6 April, 1229, he gave new <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> to the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. He financially and otherwise assisted the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> and the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> in the <a href="03712a.htm">Christianization</a> of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and the neighboring countries of the North. On 17 January, 1235, he approved the Order of Our Lady of Mercy for the <a href="12677d.htm">redemption</a> of captives. With the help of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders he planned the conversion of <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Africa and sent missionaries out of their ranks to <a href="15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, <a href="10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, and other places, where not a few suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. He also did much to alleviate the hard lot of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the Holy Land, and would have done still more, if his plans to recover the Holy Land for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> had not been frustrated by the indifference of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. The calendar of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> was enriched with some of the most popular names by Gregory IX. On 16 July, 1228, he <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, and on the next day he laid the cornerstone of the church and <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> which were erected in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>. He took part in the composition of the Office of St. Francis and also wrote some <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> in his <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>. It was also at his command that <a href="14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a> wrote a biography of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> (latest and best edition by d'Alencon, Rome, 1906). On 30 May, 1232, he <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a>, at <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>; on 10 June, 1233, St. Virgil, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and Apostle of Carinthia; on 8 July, 1234, St. Dominic, at <a href="13054a.htm">Rieti</a>; and on 27 May, 1235, St. Elizabeth of Thuringia, at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>.</p>

<p>Gregory IX was very severe towards <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who in those times were universally looked upon as traitors and punished accordingly. Upon the request of <a href="09368a.htm">King Louis IX</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, he sent Cardinal Romanus as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to assist the king in his <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. At the synod which the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> convened at <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in November, 1229, it was decreed that all <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> and their abettors should be delivered to the nobles and magistrates for their due punishment, which, in case of obstinacy, was usually death. When in 1224 <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> ordered that <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> in <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> should be burnt at the stake, Gregory IX, who was then <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, approved and published the imperial law. During his enforced absence from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1228-1231) the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> remained unmolested and became very numerous in the city. In February, 1231, therefore, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> enacted a law for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> that <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> condemned by an <a href="04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> should be delivered to the <a href="02137c.htm">secular power</a> to receive their "due punishment". This "due punishment" was death by fire for the obstinate and <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for life for the penitent. In pursuance of this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> a number of Patarini were arrested in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1231, the obstinate were burned at the stake, the others were <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> and Cava (Ryccardus de S. Germano, ad annum 1231, in Mon. Germ. SS., XIX, 363). It must not be thought, however, that Gregory IX dealt more severely with <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> than other rulers did. Death by fire was the common punishment for <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> and traitors in those times. Up to the time of Gregory IX, the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of searching out <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> belonged to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in their respective <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The so-called Monastic <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was established by Gregory IX, who in his <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of 13, 20, and 22 April, 1233, appointed the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> as the official inquisitors for all <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (Ripoil and Bremond, "Bullarium Ordinia Fratrum Praedicatorum", Rome, 1729, I, 47).</p>

<p>For a time Gregory IX lived in hope that he might effect a reunion of the Latin and Greek Churches. Germanos, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, after a conversation on the religious differences between the Greeks and the Latins, which he had with some <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at <a href="11048a.htm">Nice</a>, in 1232, addressed a letter to Gregory IX, in which he acknowledged the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy, but complained of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Greeks by the Latins. Gregory IX sent him a cordial answer and commissioned four learned <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> (two <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and two <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>) to treat with the patriarch concerning the reunion. The <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> messengers were kindly received both by the Emperor Vatatzes and by Germanos, but the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> said that he could make no concessions on matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> without the consent of the Patriarchs of Jersusalem, <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Alexandria. A synod of the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> was held at Nympha in Bithynia, to which the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> messengers were invited. But the Greeks stubbornly adhered to their <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the procession of the Holy Ghost and asserted that the Latins could not validly <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> unleavened bread. Thus Gregory IX failed, like many other <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> before and after him, in his efforts to reunite the two Churches. In 1237 the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the Syrian <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and many of his <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> renounced their <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and submitted to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (Raynaldus ad annum 1237, n. 87 sq.), but their conversion was only temporary.</p>

<p>During the thirteen years and four months of his pontificate he created about fourteen <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, many of whom were members of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The best known among them are Sinibald of Fiesco, a learned canonist, who afterwards ascended the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>; Raynald of <a href="13683b.htm">Segni</a>, a nephew of Gregory IX, who succeeded <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> as <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>; Otto of Montferrat, who spent over three years (1237-1240) as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; Jacob of Vitry, an author, confessor of St. Mary of Oignies, whose life he wrote (Acta SS., June, IV, 636-66); St. Francis Nonatus; and the learned and <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> Englishman, Robert of Somercote, who, it is said, would have succeeded Gregory IX on the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne had he not died during the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> (26 Sept., 1241). Gregory IX was also a man of learning, which he encouraged in various ways. He bestowed many privileges on the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, his <a href="01326c.htm">Alma</a> Mater, but also watched carefully over its professors, whom he warned repeatedly against the growing tendency of subjecting <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> to philosophy by making the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of the mysteries of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> dependent on <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a>. He also possesses the great merit of having again made <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelianism</a> the basis of scholastic philosophy, after the Physics of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> had been prohibited in 1210; and his Metaphysics in 1215. The prohibition of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> was meant only for the perverted Latin translation of his works and their <a href="02150c.htm">Averroistic</a> commentaries. Gregory IX commissioned <a href="15631c.htm">William of Auvergne</a> and other learned men to purge the works of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> of their <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> and thus made them again accessible to students. Among the greatest achievements of Gregory IX must be counted the collection of <a href="04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>, a work with which he entrusted Raymond of Pennaforte and which was completed in 1234 (see <a href="04670b.htm">DECRETALS</a>). The numerous letters of Gregory IX were first collected and published by Pamelius (Antwerp, 1572). Rodenburg edited 485 letters of Gregory IX, selected by Perts from the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> registers of the thirteenth century, and published them in "Mon. Germ. Epist. Rom. Pontif." (Berlin, 1883), I, 261-728. Lucian Auvray began (Paris, 1890) to edit "Les Registres de Gregoire IX, recueil des bulles de ce pape, publi&eacute;es ou analys&eacute;es d'apr&egrave;s les manuscrits originaux du Vatican", of which the eleventh fasccle appeared in 1908.</p>
