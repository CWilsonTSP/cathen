<p>There was no general council of the entire <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> held at any time in North Africa. There were, however, many national or plenary assemblies of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> representing the North African Church. These are commonly called African or Carthaginian Synods, and are not to be confounded with the district or provincial assemblies, of which there were also very many in the separate provinces of North Africa. These Roman provinces lay between the Sahara and the Mediterranean and extended from <a href="04591b.htm">Cyrenaica</a> on the east to the Atlantic on the west, corresponding roughly to the part of the continent occupied by modern Tripoli, Algeria, and <a href="10574a.htm">Morocco</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> entered into history there at the end of the second century, and disappeared in the beginning of the eighth.</p>

<h2>Ecclesiastical organizations</h2>

<p>About the middle of the third century the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the three civil provinces (Proconsular Africa, Numidia, and Mauretania) formed but one <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, but as <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were multiplied, they came to be grouped into divisions corresponding to the prevailing political divisions of the country. <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> re-districted North Africa into six civil provinces, and by the end of the fourth century the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had adjusted her organization to these lines. Thus there came to be six ecclesiastical provinces:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>Proconsular Africa;</li><li>Numidia;</li><li>Byzacena;</li><li>Tripoli;</li><li>Mauretania Sitifensis;</li><li>Imperial Mauretania.</li></ol></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>This organization lasted till the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> invasion in the seventh century. Because of its civil importance, Carthage was the <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> see and held control of these suffragan provinces, except perhaps during the period of the Byzantine domination in Africa (534-646), when Tripoli and the two Mauretanias seem to have been independent of Carthage. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a> was in rank and privilege, though not in name, the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the African Church. It was he who called and presided over the general <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, and early in the fifth century, it was his wont to sign the decrees in the name of all. These <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were held, with but few exceptions (e.g. Hippo, 393; Milevum, 402) at Carthage. In several instances we are able to name the church where the meeting took place: as "the Church of the Second District", or the "Ecclesia Restituta", or the "Secretarium Basilicae Fausti."</p>

<h2>Number of synods</h2>

<p>In the time of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> there were no <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> held in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>. But about 220, <a href="01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a> called together seventy <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> from Proconsular Africa and Numidia. From the time of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> general <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> came to be the wonted resource of Church administration, and they were held in Africa with greater frequency and regularity than elsewhere in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> from the letters of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> that, except in time of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the African <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> met at least once a year, in the springtime, and sometimes again in the autumn. Six or seven <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, for instance, were held under <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> presidency during the decade of his administration (249-258), and more than fifteen under Aurelius (391-429). The Synod of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> (393) ordered a general meeting yearly. But this was found too onerous for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and in the Synod of Carthage (407) it was decided to hold a general synod only when <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the needs of all Africa, and it was to be held at a place most convenient for the purpose. As a matter of fact, the needs were so persistent that general <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were held with perhaps equal frequency up to the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandal</a> invasion (429), and Carthage continued to be the meeting-place. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Africa then entered on "penal times". Towards the end of the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandal</a> domination there was a cessation of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were resumed. The general Synod of Carthage in 525, though numerously attended, shows in reality a <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> and diminished church. There was an improvement under the Byzantine control (533-647), and the Synod of 534 (perhaps the only general one for this period) is the second largest in point of numbers of all the African <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>. In 646 we still find the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> meeting in <a href="12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, on the very eve of the final dissolution of their ancient organization. The <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> domination spread in successive waves from 647 up to 698, when Carthage fell. Within the following half century the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Roman Africa had ceased to be.</p>

<h2>Attendance and representation</h2>

<p>Elsewhere in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> only <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> attended general <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>; but in North Africa there was, at least for a time, a departure from this custom. In the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> held under <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, to deal with the lapsed, and in the synod of 256, which considered the question of re-baptism, there were present not only the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but many <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and even a very large representation of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>. Only the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, however, had a vote in the final determinations. Not all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the country were required to assist at the general synod. At the Synod of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> (393) it was ordered that "dignities" should be sent from each <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. Only one was required from Tripoli, because of the poverty of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that province. In the <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> held in Carthage in September, 401, it was decreed that each province should be divided into two or three districts, and that each of them should send deputies to the general synod. Attendance was urgently insisted on. There were ninety <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in attendance at the synod that condemned Privatus (236-248), and more than two hundred and twenty-three, the largest recorded for Africa, at the Synod of 418. It has been through her literature, the writings of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, and, more than all, of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, rather than by her synodal action that the great Church of Africa has modified the world's history. The African <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> dealt for the most part, as was natural, with matters of local <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a>, and today are chiefly of interest to students of Church History and Canon Law. Nevertheless, at times, their decrees transcended their immediate and local scope and helped, in concert with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to fix the <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> and to define the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> Universal. The penitential decrees drawn up after the <a href="04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> and the decrees against <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> are instances in point.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Brief analysis of synodal acts</h2>

<p>The synodal decrees show how restless and factional the national temper was, and how ready to break out into violent <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Those who lapsed under <a href="04666a.htm">Decius</a> formed a party strong enough to withstand the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of the fourth and fifth centuries are constantly engaged with the bitter and persistent <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> Schism, which upset all Africa and perplexed both <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Civil intervention was invoked in the Synod of 404. The <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="04666a.htm">Decius</a> left in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, as elsewhere, many who had denied or compromised their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> under fear of death. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was now called upon to determine whether she might forgive so grave a <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. In the Synod of May, 251, under the presidency of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, it was decided that the lapsed should be admitted to penance, and should be reconciled at least at the moment of death. The next year (Synod of 252) further grace was shown them in view of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Gallus, and all who had entered seriously upon a course of penance were to be restored to fellowship at once. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Africa was not equally fortunate in finding the solution for the difficult problem of the worth of Baptism as administered outside the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The earliest synod (about 220) took the matter up and declared such Baptism invalid, and this decision was reaffirmed in <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> held in 255-256 under <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. All converts should be re-baptized. <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> strove to press the African views on <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but <a href="14288a.htm">Pope Stephen</a> menaced <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. At the celebrated September Synod of 256 the eighty-seven <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled from the three provinces still maintained their attitude against Baptism by <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. This <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> was finally retracted in the Synod (345-348) under Gratus.</p>

<p>These records show how the close relations between Africa and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> were several times troubled during the course of five centuries. The <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> controversy put the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> into a state of passive resistance to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the Synod of September, 256, <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> was placed in a painful dilemma. While maintaining the right of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to think for themselves, he still clung to the necessity of unity in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and would not break the revered bond with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Again, early in the fifth century, the appeal to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> of Apiarius, a <a href="04737b.htm">deposed</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, stirred up strong feeling among the African <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and appeals of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laics</a> "over sea" (to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>) were forbidden in the Synod of 418. Legates came from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to adjust the difference. In the Synods of 419 an enquiry was made into the canonical warrant for such appeals. The Roman <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> cited by mistake, as canons passed at Nicea (325), the canons of <a href="13473a.htm">Sardica</a> (343) regulating the appeals of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This led to a tedious delay, and the whole matter was dropped for the moment. It was reopened a few years later, when Apiarius, who had been <a href="04737b.htm">deposed</a> a second time, on new charges, again appealed to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for reinstatement. Faustinus, the Roman <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>, reappeared at the Synod of 424 and demanded the annulment of the sentence passed on the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. Apiarius, however, broke down under examination, and admitted his guilt. So nothing further could be done for him. A synodal letter to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> emphasized how needful it was that <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> should not lightly credit all complainants from <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, nor receive into fellowship such as had been <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</p>

<p>At the Synod of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> (393), and again at the Synod of 397 at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, a list of the books of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> was drawn up. It is the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> canon (i.e. including the books classed by <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> as "Apocrypha"). The latter synod, at the end of the enumeration, added, "But let Church beyond sea (Rome) be consulted about confirming this canon". <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was one among the forty-four <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who signed the proceedings. Celestius, the friend of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, came to Carthage to be <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>; Paulinus, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, warned the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a> against him; and thus, in 411, began the series of <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> against <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. They had a most important influence in checking its spread. The earlier ones seem to have been provincial. The important Synod of 416, under Sylvanus, at <a href="10304b.htm">Milevum</a> urged <a href="08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> to stop the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and in the synod of all Africa held at Carthage in 420 the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, intensely convinced that vital issues were involved, passed a series of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> utterances with annexed <a href="01455e.htm">anathemas</a> against the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was present. It was, in respect of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, the most important of all the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of Africa. It is no longer possible from the meagre remains to attempt a complete list of the general <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of Africa; nor is it any longer possible to determine, with exactness in every instance, what <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were general. The following approximate enumeration is made therefore with all due reserve:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><em>Under St. Cyprian.</em> Synods about A.D. 220 under <a href="01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>; 236-248 (condemned Privatus of Lambesa). Carthage, 251, 252, 254, 255; Autumn of 255, or Spring of 256; September 256.</li><li><em>Under Gratus.</em> at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, 345-348.</li><li><em>Under Aurelius.</em> at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo-Regius</a>, 393, 394, 397 (two sessions), June and September; 401; at <a href="10304b.htm">Milevum</a>, 402; at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, 403-410, end of 417 or beginning of 418; May, 418; May and November, 419; 420, 424.</li><li><em>Under Boniface.</em> Synod of Carthage, 525, 534. </li></ul></div>
