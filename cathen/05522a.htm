<p>Ermland, or Ermeland (Varmiensis, Warmia), a district of East Prussia and an exempt <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. <a href="01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> of Prague (d. 997) and <a href="03018a.htm">St. Bruno of Querfurt</a> (d. 1009) converted the early inhabitants of this region, the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="12519c.htm">Prussians</a>, to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and two centuries later <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> and members of the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> introduced civilization also into the land. Among these later was the saintly <a href="03704a.htm">Bishop Christian of Oliva</a> (d. 1245). In 1243 the territorial possessions of the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> were divided into the Dioceses of <a href="04566a.htm">Culm</a>, Pomesanien, Ermland, and Samland. Albert of Suerbeer, who came from Cologne, and who had been <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, was appointed <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In 1251 he took Riga for his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, a choice which was confirmed by <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, who in 1255 made Riga the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the four <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> just mentioned. A <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Order of <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>, Heinrich of Strateich, was selected as the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ermland, but he was not able to enter upon his office. It was not until August 28, 1251, that the first actual <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ermland, Anselm of <a href="10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, who was also a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> belonging to the Order of <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Valenciennes by the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> Pietro of <a href="01255b.htm">Albano</a>. The diocese included the whole of old <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> districts of Warmien, Natangen, Barten, and Galindien, the northern half of Pomesanien and the southern halves of Nadrauen and Sudauen. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was given one-third of this territory as personal <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> for his support, and in this district he was the secular ruler and a prince of the Holy Roman Empire; these <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> were confirmed in the Golden <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of the Emperor Charles IV. In 1260 Bishop Anselm founded a chapter of sixteen canons attached to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Andreas at Braunsberg and transferred to the chapter the right of electing the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But Braunsberg was ravaged by the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="12519c.htm">Prussians</a> in 1262, and the second <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Heinrich I (1278-1300), was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> in 1280 to transfer the chapter to Frauenburg. where it has remained ever since.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From the thirteenth century to the fifteenth the history of Ermland was one of constant <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>. Repeated rebellions of the native <a href="12519c.htm">Prussians</a>, incursions of the Lithuanians, and frequent <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> with <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, in which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was always the faithful ally of the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, checked the development of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the cultivation of the soil. To these disorders were added the constant encroachment and <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> who sought to bring Ermland, like other <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, under the dominion of the order. Ermland, however, defended its <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> with great determination with such efforts, and would not allow the order to influence in any way the election of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the chapter. Yet in everything else the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> held faithfully to the order, even when its star began to decline, and the whole territory ruled by the <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a> revolted in the so-called War of the Cities (1454-66). It was in this period that the celebrated Cardinal Enea Silvio de'Piccolomini (&AElig;neas Silvius) was elected (1457) <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ermland; in the following year, however, he ascended the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. The Peace of Thorn (1466) removed the diocese from the protectorate of the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> and placed it under the sovereignty of the King of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>. This transfer caused the discord to break out afresh, for the King of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> claimed for himself in Ermland the same right he exercised in the rest of his kingdom, that of naming the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Bishop Nikolaus of T&uuml;ngen (1467-89) and especially the determined Lukas Watzelrode (1489-1512) energetically opposed these <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> claims and guarded the right of a free election of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1512 the latter <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> obtained from <a href="08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> the release of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> from its suffragan connexion, always a loose one, with the metropolitan See of Riga. When this relationship was dissolved Ermland was declared an exempt <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and has remained such ever since. Bishop Watzelrode was equally successful in regulating the internal affairs of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On February 20, 1497, he held a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod at Heilsberg, where the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> resided until 1800; in 1503 he made new <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> for his domain, reorganized the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Frauenburg, selecting it for excellent teachers, among whom was his celebrated nephew <a href="04352b.htm">Copernicus</a>, published the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a> (Nuremberg, 1494) and the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> (Strasburg, 1497), etc. His weak successor Fabian of Lozanien (1512-23), however, in the Treaty of Piotrkow (December 7, 1512), conceded to the King of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> a limited influence in the election of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Existing conditions were, however, entirely changed by the defection to <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> of Albrecht of Bradenburg, Grand Master of the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>, and the two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the order who ruled Samland and Pomesanien, and the secularization of the dominion of the order by the Peace of Cracow (1525). Two-thirds of the former 220 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Ermland went to the two <a href="01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In these troubled times excellent episcopal rulers saved the diocese from complete defection; among these <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> was the energetic Moriz Ferber (1523-37), who by the ordinances issued in 1526 restored order to this desolated territory; another such <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Joannes Dantiscus (1527-48), a noted poet and diplomat, who conscientiously fulfilled his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and raised the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> (concerning Dantiscus cf. Czaplicki, De vit&acirc; et carminibus J. de Curiis Dantisci, <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, 1855; Geistliche Gedichte des Dantiscus &uuml;bersetzt und herausgegeben von Franz Hipler, M&uuml;nster, 1857).</p>

<p>But the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who deserve the greatest praise for holding the diocese to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> when threatened by the surrounding <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> were <a href="07473a.htm">Stanislaus Hosius</a> (1551-79), later a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who was distinguished for learning and virtue, and Martin Kromer (1579-89), a noted historian. Among the means successfully used for the maintenance of the Faith were the assembling of various <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, of which the most important was the one held by <a href="07473a.htm">Hosius</a> in 1565 for the purpose of carrying out the decisions of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; yearly visitations, and above all the founding of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">College</a> at Braunsberg in 1565 [cf. Duhr, Geschichte des Jesuiten in den L&auml;ndern deutscher Zunge (Freiburg im Br., 1907), I, 79 sqq., 307 sqq.] In addition to these the Congregation of St. Catherine (<em>Katharinerinnen</em>), founded at Braunsberg in 1571 by Regina Prothmann, did effective work in the instruction and training of girls; since the annulment of the right of teaching at the same time of the <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> the congregation has devoted itself almost entirely to the nursing of the sick. In the seventeenth century (1626-30, 1655-56), and at the beginning of the eighteenth century (1703-09), the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was repeatedly ravaged by the Swedes, who forcibly supressed the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> services and carried away its literary and artistic treasures. At the time of the first Partition of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1772) the whole of Ermland fell to the share of the kingdom of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In the treaty of <a href="15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> (September 18, 1773), King Fredrich II, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, guaranteed the <em>status quo</em> and the free exercise of religion for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the annexed provinces, nevertheless all <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and institutions for <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and training under religious control were gradually supressed, and the landed <a href="12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> secularized.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De salute animarum", of July 16, 1820, readjusted <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> relations for Ermland as well as for the whole of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The Diocese of Ermland now received not only the territory which had been forcibly taken from it at the time of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, but there were incorporated in it as well the whole of the former Diocese of Samland, five deaneries of the former Diocese of Pomesanien, and, in 1854, the country surrounding Marienwerder. Among the more important Bishops of Ermland during the nineteenth century were: Philippus Krementz, (1867-85), later <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and the successor of Bishop Krementz, Andreas Thiel (1885-1908); after the death of the later (July 17, 1908), Professor August Bludau of M&uuml;nster, a native of Ermland, was elected <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>.</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>
