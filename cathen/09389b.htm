<p>Notre-Dame de Lourdes, in the Department of Hautes Pyren&eacute;es, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, is far-famed for the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of which it is a centre and for the extraordinary events that have occurred and still occur there.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Lourdes is founded on the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin to a poor, fourteen-year-old girl, Bernadette Soubiroux. The first apparition occurred 11 February, 1858. There were eighteen in all; the last took place 16 July, of the same year. Bernadette often fell into an <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>. The mysterious vision she saw in the hollow of the rock Massabielle was that of a young and beautiful lady. "Lovelier than I have ever seen" said the child. But the girl was the only one who saw the vision, although sometimes many stood there with her. Now and then the apparition spoke to the seer who also was the only one who heard the voice. Thus, she one day told her to drink of a mysterious fountain, in the grotto itself, the existence of which was unknown, and of which there was no sign, but which immediately gushed forth. On another occasion the apparition bade Bernadette go and tell the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> she wished a <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> to be built on the spot and processions to be made to the grotto. At first the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were incredulous. It was only four years later, in 1862, that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> declared the faithful "justified in <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> the reality of the apparition". A basilica was built upon the rock of Massabielle by M. Peyramale, the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1873 the great "national" <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> were inaugurated. Three years later the basilica was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> solemnly <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a>. In 1883 the foundation stone of another church was laid, as the first was no longer large enough. It was built at the foot of the basilica and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1901 and called the Church of the Rosary. <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> authorized a special office and a Mass, in commemoration of the apparition, and in 1907 <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> extended the observance of this feast to the entire Church; it is now observed on 11 February.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Never has a sanctuary attracted such throngs. At the end of the year 1908, when the fiftieth anniversary of the apparition was celebrated, although the record really only began from 1867, 5297 <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> had been registered and these had brought 4,919,000 <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. Individual <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> are more numerous by far than those who come in groups. To their number must be added the visitors who do not come as <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, but who are attracted by a religious feeling or sometimes merely by the desire to see this far-famed spot. The Company of the Chemins de Fer du Midi estimates that the Lourdes station receives over one million travellers per annum. Every nation in the world furnishes its contingent. Out of the total of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> given above, four hundred and sixty-four came from countries other than <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. They are sent by the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, <a href="02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>, etc. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> lead the way. At the end of the year of the fiftieth anniversary, 2013 <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, including 546 <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 10 <a href="12423b.htm">primates</a>, 19 <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, 69 <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, had made the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Lourdes. But more remarkable still than the crowd of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> is the series of wonderful occurrences which take place under the protection of the celebrated sanctuary. Passing over spiritual cures, which more often than not escape human observance, we shall confine ourselves to bodily diseases. The writer of this article has recorded every recovery, whether partial or complete, and in the first half-century of the shrine's existence he has counted 3962. Notwithstanding very careful statistics which give the names and surnames of the patients who have recovered, the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the cure, the name of the disease, and generally that of the physician who had charge of the case, there are inevitably <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> or mistaken cases, attributable, as a rule, to the excited fancy of the afflicted one and which time soon dispels. But it is only right to note: first, that these unavoidable <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> regard only secondary cases which have not like the others been the object of special study; it must also be noted that the number of cases is equalled and exceeded by actual cures which are not put on record. The afflicted who have recovered are not <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to present themselves and half of them do not present themselves, at the Bureau des Constatations M&eacute;dicales at Lourdes, and it is from this bureau's official reports that the list of cures is drawn up.</p>

<p>The estimate that about 4000 cures have been obtained at Lourdes within the first fifty years of the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> is undoubtedly considerably less than the actual number. The Bureau des Constatations stands near the shrine, and there are recorded and checked the certificates of maladies and also the certificates of cure; it is free to all physicians, whatever their nationality or religious <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>. Consequently, on an average, from two to three hundred physicians annual visit this marvellous clinic. As to the nature of the diseases which are cured, nervous disorders so frequently mentioned, do not furnish even the fourteenth part of the whole; 278 have been counted, out of a total of 3962. The present writer has published the number of cases of each disease or infirmity, among them tuberculosis, tumours, sores, cancers, deafness, blindness, etc. The "Annales des Sciences Physiques", a sceptical review whose chief editor is Doctor Ch. Richet, Professor at the Medical Faculty of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, said in the course of a long article, apropos of this faithful study: "On reading it, unprejudiced minds cannot but be convinced that the facts stated are authentic."</p>

<h2>Their cause</h2>

<p>There exists no natural cause capable of producing the cures witnessed at Lourdes which dispense an unbiassed mind from tracing them back to the particular agency of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Those who refused to <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in a <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> intervention sought at first the scientific interpretation of the occurrences in the chemical composition of the water of the Grotto. But it was then declared by an eminent chemist officially appointed to make the analysis and his statement has since been corroborated, that the water contains no curative properties of a natural character. Then the incredulous said, perhaps it operates through its temperature, or the results obtained at Lourdes may be accounted for by the bathing in cold water. However, every one knows that hydrotherapy is practised elsewhere than at Lourdes, and that it does not work the <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a> of curing every kind of disease, from cancers to troubles which bring on blindness. Besides, many ailing ones are cured without ever bathing in the basins of the Grotto; this decides the question. Therefore, those who deny <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> intervention attribute the wonderful results seen at Lourdes to two other causes. The first is suggestion. To this we answer unhesitatingly that suggestion is radically powerless to furnish the hoped-for explanation. Omitting nervous or functional diseases, since they are in the minority among those registered as cured at the Medical Office of the Grotto, and the fact we are now establishing does not require them to be taken into account, we may confine our attention to organic diseases. Can suggestion be used efficaciously in diseases of this nature? The most learned and daring of the suggestionists of the present day, Bernheim, a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>, head of the famous <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, the more advanced rival of the Ecole de la Salp&eacute;tri&egrave;re, answers in the negative in twenty passages of the book in which he has recorded the result of his observations: "Hypnotisme, Suggestion, Psychotherapie" (Paris, 1903, 2nd edition). Studying this work, we find also that in the very cases where suggestion has a chance of success, as in certain functional diseases, it requires the co-operation of time, it cures slowly and progressively, while the complete cures of Lourdes are instantaneous. Therefore curative suggestion is no explanation. It is not suggestion that operates at Lourdes; the cause which cures acts differently and is <a href="08004a.htm">infinitely</a> more powerful.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>There remains the last resource of having recourse to some unknown law and of saying, for instance, "How do we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that some natural force of which we are still <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> does not operate the marvellous cures which are attributed directly to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>?" How do we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>? In the first place, if a law of this nature did exist, the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> of Lourdes would not be cognizant of it any more than the rest of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a>; neither would they <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> any better than others how to set it in motion. Why should this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> operate for them and not for others? Is it because they deny its existence and the others <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in it? Moreover, not only there does not exist, but there cannot exist, and consequently will never exist, a <a href="09076a.htm">natural law</a> producing instantaneously the generation of tissues affected with lesion, that is to say, the cure of an organic disease. Why so? Because any growth and consequently any restoration of the tissues of the organism is accomplished &#151; and this is a scientific fact &#151; by the increase and growth of the protoplasms and cells which compose every living body. Every existing protoplasm comes from some former protoplasm, and that from a previous one and so on, back to the very beginning; these generation (the fact is self-evident) are necessarily successive, that is, they require the co-operation of time. Therefore, in order that a natural force should be able to operate a sudden cure in an organic disease, the essential basis of life as it is in the present creation would have to be overthrown; nature as we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> it would have to be destroyed and another created on a different plan. Therefore, the hypothesis of unknown forces of nature cannot be brought forward to explain the instantaneous cures of Lourdes. It is <a href="09324a.htm">logically</a> untenable. As a matter of fact, no natural cause, known or unknown, is sufficient to account for the marvellous cures witnessed at the foot of the celebrated rock where the Virgin Immaculate deigned to appear. They can only be from the intervention of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
