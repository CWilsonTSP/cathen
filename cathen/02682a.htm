<p><a href="01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a>; comprises the entire department of the Gironde and was established conformably to the Concordat of 1802 by combining the ancient Diocese of Bordeaux (diminished by the cession of Born to the Bishopric of <a href="01237a.htm">Aire</a>) with the greater part of the suppressed Diocese of Bazas. Constituted by the same Concordat <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> to the <a href="05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a>, <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> and La Rochelle, the See of Bordeaux received in 1822, as additional suffragans, those of <a href="01209b.htm">Agen</a>, withdrawn from the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and the newly re-established P&eacute;rigueux and Lu&ccedil;on, and still later, in 1850, the three colonial <a href="05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of Fort-de-France (Martinique), Basse-Terre (Guadaloupe), and Saint-Denis (R&eacute;union).</p>

<h2>The old diocese of Bordeaux</h2>

<p>According to old Limousin legends which date back to the beginning of the eleventh century, Bordeaux was evangelized in the first century by <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> (Martialis), who replaced a temple to the unknown god, which he destroyed, with one dedicated to St. Stephen. The same legends represent <a href="09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> as having brought to the Soulac coast <a href="15362a.htm">St. Veronica</a>, who is still especially <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the church of Notre-Dame de Fin des Terres at Soulac; as having cured Sigebert, the paralytic husband of the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> Benedicta, and made him <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bordeaux; as addressing beautiful Latin letters to the people of Bordeaux, to which city he is said to have left the <a href="04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a> which has been treasured as a <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> by the Chapter of Saint-Seurin (For this cycle of legends see <a href="09263a.htm">LIMOGES</a>).</p>

<p>The first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bordeaux known to history, Orientalis, is mentioned at the <a href="01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a>, in 314. By the close of the fourth century <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had made such progress in Bordeaux that a synod was held there (385-386) for the purpose of adopting measures against the Priscillianists, whose <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> had caused popular disturbances. This was during the episcopate of Delphinus (380-404), who attended the Council of Saragossa in 380 and maintained correspondence with <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> and with <a href="11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>. At the beginning of the fifth century a mysterious personage who, according to <a href="07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, came from the East, appeared at Bordeaux. This was St. Seurin (or Severinus), in whose favour Bishop Amand abdicated the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> from 410 to 420, resuming it after Seurin's death and occupying it until 432. In the sixth century Bordeaux had an illustrious <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of Leontius II (542-564), a man of great influence who used his wealth in building churches and clearing lands and whom the poet <a href="06149a.htm">Fortunatus</a> calls <em>patrioe caput</em>. During this Merovingian period the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, founded in the fourth century, occupied the same site that it does today, back to back against the ramparts of the ancient city. The Faubourg Saint-Seurin outside the city was a great centre of popular devotion, with its three large <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of St. Stephen, St. Seurin, and St. Martin surrounding a large <a href="03504a.htm">necropolis</a> from which a certain number of sarcophagi are still preserved. This faubourg was like a holy city; and the cemetery of St. Seurin was full of <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Merovingian period around which the popular <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> of later ages was to create legends. In the high noon of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it used to be told how <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself had <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> this cemetery and that <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, having fought the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> near Bordeaux, had visited it and laid Roland's wonderful horn Olivant on the altar of Saint Seurin.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dessus l'autel de Saint Seurin le baron, Il met l'oliphant plein d'or et de mangons </p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash;says the "Chanson de Roland". Many <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> passed for those of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> gallant <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>, and others were honored as the resting-places of Veronica and Benedicta. At the other extremity of the city, the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> filled in the marshes of L'Eau-Bourde and founded there the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sainte-Croix. While thus surrounded by evidences of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> conquest, the academic Bordeaux of the Merovingian period continued to cherish the memory of its former <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of eloquence, whose chief glories had been the poet Ausonius (310-395) and St. Paulinus (353-431), who had been a rhetorician at Bordeaux and died <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11089b.htm">Nola</a>. The reigns of William VIII and William IX, Dukes of Aquitaine (1052-1127), were noted for the splendid development of Romanesque architecture in Bordeaux. Parts of the churches of Sainte-Croix and Saint-Seurin belong to that time, and the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Saint-Andr&eacute; was begun in 1096.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, a struggle between the Sees of Bordeaux and Bourges was brought about by the claims of the latter to the primacy of Aquitaine. This question has been closely investigated by modern scholars, and it has been ascertained that a certain letter from <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> to Rodolfus, which would date the existence of the primacy of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a> from the ninth century, is not authentic. As ths capital of <em>Aquitania prima</em>, Bourges at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> vaguely aspired to pre-eminence over the provinces of <em>Aquitania secunda</em> and <em>tertia</em>, and thence over Bordeaux. It was about 1073 that these aspirations were more formally asserted; between 1112 and 1126 the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> acknowledged them, and in 1146 Eugenius III confirmed the primacy of Pierre de la Chatre, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, over Bordeaux. In 1232, <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> gave the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, as patriarch, the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to visit the province of Aquitaine, imposed upon the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bordeaux the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of assisting, at least once, at the councils held by his "brother" of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, and decided that appeals might be made from the former to the latter. Occasionally, however, as in 1240 and 1284, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a> coming to Bordeaux, found the doors of the churches closed against them, and answered with <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> the solemn protests which the Bordeaux <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> made against their visits. Aquitaine was lost to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by the annulment of that marriage between Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine which was celebrated in the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Bordeaux in the year 1137, and Bordeaux became the capital of the English possessions in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Thereupon the struggle between the Sees of Bordeaux and Bourges assumed a political character, the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> necessarily upholding the claims of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. Most of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> were conspicuous as agents of English policy in Aquitaine, notable amongst them being Guillaume Amanieu (1207-26), on whom King Henry III of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> conferred the title of seneschal and guardian of all his lands beyond the sea, and who took part in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, G&eacute;rard de Mallemort (1227-60), a generous founder of <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, who acted as mediator between St. Louis and Henry III, and defended Gascony against the tyranny of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. During the episcopate of Gerard de Mallemort the old Romanesque church of Saint-Andr&eacute; was transformed into a Gothic <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. <a href="04020a.htm">Pope Clement V</a> (1305-14) was unfavourable to the claims of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. He was a native of Villandraut near Bazas, where he had built a beautiful collegiate church, was <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bordeaux from 1300 to 1305, and political adviser to <a href="12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>. When he became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, in spite of his French sympathies, his heart was set upon the formal emancipation of Bordeaux from <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. <a href="02492c.htm">Blessed Pierre Berland</a>, or Peyberland as tradition calls him (1430-57), was an <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bordeaux, illustrious for his intelligence and <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>, founder of the <a href="02684a.htm">University of Bordeaux</a> and of the College of St. Raphael for poor students, who, after helping the English to defend Bordeaux against the troops of Charles VII, received Dunois into his episcopal city and surrendered it to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. It was during his episcopate that the beautiful campanile known as the Pey Berland Tower was added to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.</p>

<p>The rich and powerful chapters of Saint-Andre and Saint-Seurin subsisted in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> as a vestige of that duality which was already noticeable in Merovingian Bordeaux. Between the two there were frequent and very animated conflicts. The artistic feeling of the canons in the thirteenth century is attested by the Gothic portal of Saint-Seurin which is still extant. At the end of the fourteenth century Canon Vital de Carle established the great Hospital of Saint-Andr&eacute;, which he placed under the protection of the municipality; and it was through the exertions of the chapter of Saint-Andr&eacute; that the first city <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of Bordeaux was founded towards the year 1402. During the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Bordeaux was a great monastic city, with its <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, Francisean, and <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, founded respectively in 1217, 1227, and 1230. In 1214 an important council was held in Bordeaux against <a href="15235c.htm">usurers</a>, highwaymen, and <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. When, after the Hundred Years' War, Bordeaux again became French, Louis XI flattered its citizens by joining the <a href="04223a.htm">confraternity</a> of Notre-Dame de Montuzet, a religious association formed of all the mariners of the Gironde by heaping favours on the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of Saint-Michel, the tower of which, built in the period between 1473 and 1492, was higher than the Pey Berland, and by furthering the <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of its former <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="02492c.htm">Pierre Berland</a>.</p>

<p>Among the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Bordeaux, in the modern epoch, may be mentioned: Charles de Gramont (1530-44), who during its earliest years helped the College of Guyenne (founded in 1533) and introduced into Bordeaux the art of the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>; Fran&ccedil;ois de Sourdis (1599-1628), who had great political influence during the minority of Louis XIII, caused the marshes in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux to be filled in, erected there a magnificent <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, welcomed to Bordeaux many congregations devoted to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform, approved (1606) the teaching order of the Filles de Notre-Dame, founded by Blessed Jeanne de Lestonnac, and befriended the College of the Madeleine founded by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in opposition to the College of Guyenne which, during the sixteenth century, was open to <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> influences, Cardinal de <a href="03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> (1826-36), who during the cholera epidemic had the sign <em>Maison de Secours</em> (House of Refuge) put over his palace, of whom M. Jullian said that no <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> in the history of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> had come nearer the ideal of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and during whose episcopate Th&eacute;r&egrave;se de Lamourus, the "Good Mother", considered by Cardinal <a href="03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> a saint worthy of the early days of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, opened for repentant <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> the Maison de la Mis&eacute;ricorde; <a href="05132a.htm">Cardinal Donnet</a> (1837-82), who re-established the old provincial councils interrupted for 224 years.</p>

<h2>The old bishopric of Bacas</h2>

<p>According to <a href="07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, Bazas had a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the time of the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandal</a> invasion in the fifth century. The dedication of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> is explained in an account given by the same historian that a lady of Bazas, whom certain hagiographers of the nineteenth century believe to have been St. Veronica, brought from Palestine a <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> at the time of that saint's death. For two hundred and fifty years prior to 1057, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bazas bore the title of <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01237a.htm">Aire</a>, <a href="16032b.htm">Dax</a>, <a href="02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>, Oloron, and Lescar. <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (1088-99) preached the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> at Bazas.</p>

<h2>Places of ecclesiastical interest in the archdiocese</h2>

<p>The town of La R&eacute;ole (from <em>Regula</em>, rule) owes its origin, and even its name, to a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded in 777, destroyed bv the <a href="11115b.htm">Northmen</a>, and rebuilt in 977 by Sancho of Gascony and his brother, Bishop Gombald. It was there that Abbo, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fleury, who came to reform the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1004, was assassinated. The town of Saint-Emilion is likewise indebted for its origin to the <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> of that name, a native of <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, who died in 767 after having founded in these parts an <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> which the Augustinians occupied after the year 1110. The Abbey of Saint-Romain at Blaye in which, it is said, the remains of Roland, nephew of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, were once preserved, was founded on the spot where, in the fourth century, <a href="13163a.htm">St. Romanus</a>, the <a href="07280a.htm">recluse</a>, died in the arms of St. Martin. The <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Grande Sauve entre Deux Mers was founded in 1080 by St. Gerard of Corbie. The Abbey of Notre Dame at Guitres had for <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, between 1624 and 1637, Peiresc the celebrated <a href="11152a.htm">numismatist</a>, one of the greatest scholars of the seventeenth century (1580-1637).</p>

<p>The most important <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> is that of Notre Dame of Verdelais, founded in 1390 by Isabella, Countess of Foix, when her mule stumbled over a buried <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>.</p>
