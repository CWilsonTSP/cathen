<p>(<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Beneficium</em>, a benefit)</p>

<p>Popularly the term <em>benefice</em> is often understood to denote either certain <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> destined for the support of <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of religion, or a spiritual office or function, such as the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, but in the strict sense it signifies a right, i.e. the right given permanently by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a> to receive <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenues on account of the performance of some spiritual service. Four characteristics are essential to every benefice:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to revenue from <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>, the beneficed cleric being the usufructuary and not the proprietor of the source of his support;</li><li>a twofold perpetuity, objective and subjective, inasmuch as the source of income must be permanently established and at the same time the appointment to the benefice must be for life, and not subject to revocation, save for the causes and in the cases specified by law;</li><li>a formal <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority giving to certain funds or <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> the character or title of a benefice;</li><li>an annexed office or spiritual function of some kind, such as the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, the exercise of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, the celebration of Mass or the recitation of time <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>.</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>This last mentioned element is fundamental, since a benefice exists only for the sake of securing the performance of <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> connected with the worship of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and is based on the Scriptural teaching that they who serve the altar should live by the altar. In fact, as <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> declares, the sole purpose of the foundation of benefices was to enable the church to have at her command <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> who might devote themselves freely to works of religion.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The need which benefices are intended to meet was in the earlier centuries of the life of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> satisfied in other ways. From the beginning, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was supported by the liberality of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but originally all offerings were transmitted to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who took charge of their administration and distribution. Usually the mass of donations was divided into four portions, of which one went to the support of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, another to the maintenance of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, a third to the repair and construction of churches, and a fourth to the relief of the needy and afflicted. Under this system even those <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> who ministered in rural <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to send the oblations received in their churches to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to swell the common fund and to be submitted to the ordinary rule of allotment. The inconvenience attending this method, especially because the offerings were frequently in kind, increased with the growth of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, particularly with the multiplication of country <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Moreover the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> came to possess considerable real <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. Hence early in the sixth century we find in some places the practice of allowing some of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to retain for themselves and for their churches the gifts which they had received or even the income from <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had acquired. The latter form of grant, in connexion with lands or permanent endowments, was known as <em>precaria</em>, a name which indicates its unstable tenure; on the death of the possessor the source of his revenue reverted to the common fund of <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>, and could not serve for the support of a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a> unless devoted anew to this purpose by a formal act of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. Though these <em>precari&oelig;</em> were in the beginning contrary to the canons, circumstances justified their increasing employment, and they paved the way for the recognition of the modern benefice.</p>

<p>All that was needed to transform the <em>precari&oelig;</em> into benefices, was to do away with the need of a new episcopal <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> assigning the income from certain lands or other <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> to the support of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> on the occurrence of a vacancy, and to recognize in the source of income a perpetual foundation for this specific purpose. When this was done and the incumbent was given permanency in office, the modern benefice came into being. It was of gradual growth, its beginning <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the sixth century and its universal adoption being delayed until the eleventh century. Since the usufruct allowed to <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> resembled the grants of land which sovereigns were accustomed to make to subjects who had distinguished themselves by military or political service, and which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was at times compelled to concede to powerful lay lords in order to secure <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> protection in troubled times, it was natural that the term benefice, which had been applied to these grants, should be employed to denote the similar practice in regard to <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Wherever the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> holds sway the establishment of benefices is the rule. In more than one country a system developed by centuries of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> has fallen before decrees of secularization, but if the usurping government makes a pretence of compensation by stipends to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, such stipends are regarded by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as beneficiary revenue, and those who receive them retain the status of beneficed <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> benefices are almost unknown. A solitary example in <a href="11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> figured as a notable exception in the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Second Plenary Council. A few <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> benefices are found in the province of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, and there is good ground for the opinion which sees in permanent rectorships all the requisites of a benefice; but these instances, with the episcopates, are in marked contrast with the general organization of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, also, benefices are the exception, but in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> they are more common (Gignac, Compend. Jur. Eccl., Quebec, 1906). The beneficiary system plays an important part in the discipline of the evangelical churches on the continent of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and of the <a href="01498a.htm">State church of England</a>. In 1900, out of 22,800 <a href="04049b.htm">clergymen</a> at work in the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>, 13,872 were beneficed. (For benefices or "livings" in the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> see Phillimore, "Ecclesiastical Law"; Idem, "Book of Church Law", London, 1899, 227; ibid. the Benefices Act of 1898. For the Evangelical Churches see Hinschius, "Kirchenrecht", <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1869 sq.; Friedberg, "Lehrbuch des Kirchenrechts", 4th ed., 1895; Real Encyk. f. Prot. Theol. und Kirche, 3d ed., 1897, II, 596.)</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Division</h2>

<p>Benefices are divided into simple and double; major and minor; elective, presentative, and collative; residential and non-residential; perpetual and manual; <a href="13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="12722c.htm">regular</a>. Simple benefices are those which involve only the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of reciting the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> or of celebrating <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>. Double benefices imply the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> or <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the external forum or administrative functions, and, if they be episcopal or supra-episcopal in rank, are styled major benefices. A benefice is elective when the appointing authority may collate only after some electoral body has named the future incumbent; presentative when such <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> belongs to a patron; collative when the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or other superior appoints independently of any election or presentation. The distinction between residential and non-residential benefices is based upon the fact that in some cases the canons or articles of foundation impose the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of residence in the locality of the benefice while in other cases no such <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> is annexed. Manual benefices are not benefices in the strict sense, since their distinctive note is that appointments to them are revocable at the will of the collating authority. A legal presumption exists that all benefices are secular, but those which exist in churches or houses of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders or which by custom or by the will of the founder have been appropriated to religious are known as regular benefices. This last distinction has at times a special importance because of the rule requiring that secular benefices be conferred only on <a href="13675a.htm">secular clerics</a>, regular benefices only on regulars.</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>

<p>Benefices can be created only by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, since the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to revenue which they suppose is always necessarily connected with some spiritual function, and is therefore reckoned among the <em>jura spiritualia</em> controlled by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The competent authority may be the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or one possessing quasi-episcopal authority, it being always understood that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> has exclusive control of all major benefices. A benefice must be erected in a church or at an altar, under the title of some saint or mystery, and with the annexed <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of rendering some spiritual service. Since the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of compensation is always implied, a sufficient endowment must in every case be guaranteed, the amount varying with the character of the benefice, the locality of the foundation, and the nature of the services which are to be rendered. In some countries, as in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, the consent of the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> is a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> preliminary to the creation of a benefice.</p>

<h2>Modification</h2>

<p>A benefice once erected is understood to be perpetual, but the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> must and does provide for circumstances which may require an alteration of the status of a benefice by union or division, or even its entire suppression or extinction. Sometimes, owing to changed conditions, especially to a diminution of revenue, it becomes <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to unite two or more benefices. This union may be effected in two ways, either so that an entirely new individual entity is brought into being, or so that the original titles remain, but are conferred on one cleric instead of several. In this latter case a distinction has to be made between a union in which both benefices retain their legal autonomy and a union in which one benefice is made legally dependent on the other. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> alone can unite major benefices; minor benefices are subject in this respect to episcopal authority, with very few exceptions. A <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not allowed to proceed to the union of benefices unless such action be justified by reasons of necessity or of advantage, and unless a hearing be first granted to all interested <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. The patron, if there be one, and the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter are the only parties whose consent, as distinguished from mere opinion, is required. The division of benefices, which is most frequently verified in connexion with <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, is authorized when the incumbent is unable on account of increasing <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> to meet the requirements of his office, even with the help of such auxiliaries as the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> allows. The formalities are generally the same as for a union. The term "dismembration" is frequently employed as a synonym for division, but strictly speaking it denotes an act by which a part of the goods or revenues of one benefice is given perpetually to another benefice or to some other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> entity. In this case no new benefice is set up, and the act in question is in reality simply an alienation of <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>, and is therefore governed by the rules applicable to alienation. Dismembration is also used at times to signify the separation of a certain territory with its inhabitants from one <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> and its incorporation in another, which may be effected for sufficient reason. The extinction of benefices occurs when both the benefice and the church to which it is attached are utterly destroyed or cease completely to have any connexion with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship, as happened in the past when certain countries were overrun by infidels or <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and in more recent times on the occasion of acts of usurpation by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>. Suppression differs from extinction in that it simply terminates the existence of a benefice, leaving intact the church and any other benefices which may be connected with it. Suppression involves a diminution of religious service, and is consequently regarded as odious in law. Nevertheless a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> may for good reasons and with the consent of his chapter proceed to suppression, and at times such action is rendered <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> by a considerable depreciation in the value of the beneficiary <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> or by the departure of the population to whose spiritual needs the benefice was intended to minister. Suppression is not infrequently requested by patrons. In such cases the practice is not to consent to absolute suppression, at least of the religious service depending on the benefice, but simply to the exoneration of the patron and his renunciation of the <em>jus patronatus</em>.</p>

<h2>Collation</h2>

<p>The collation or granting of benefices may be ordinary or extraordinary, free or <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The distinction between ordinary and extraordinary collation is based upon the fact that while, ordinarily major benefices are disposed of by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and minor benefices by <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it may occasionally happen that this rule suffers an exception in so far as it relates to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, either because of a special provision of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> in favour of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or of some other authority, or because, on the failure of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to act, the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint devolves on his superior. These exceptions are known as extraordinary collations. From the eleventh century, extraordinary collations by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> became more and more common, usually taking the form of <em>mandata de providendo, liter&oelig; expectativ&oelig;</em>, and reservations. The <em>mandata de providendo</em> were intended to give to the cleric named therein a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to a benefice already vacant in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to whom the mandate was directed. <em>Liter&oelig; expectativ&oelig;</em> were similar <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> interventions in regard to <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> benefices, but affected benefices not yet vacant, the recipient of the letter being given a claim on a benefice as soon as it should be at the disposal of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. These two methods of extraordinary collation were not productive of <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> results; they proved to be prejudicial to episcopal authority; they were taken advantage of by unworthy aspirants for <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices; and at times they were <a href="06249a.htm">fraudulently</a> obtained and offered for sale. Hence their reprobation by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, cap. xix De ref). This animadversion of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> was not, it is needless to say, a limitation of any <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogative; its sole purpose being to forestall possible abuses on time part of petitioners for favours from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Reservations are still in operation, and consist in this, that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> reserves to himself in specified cases the collation of certain <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> benefices. After serving for centuries as a <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a> of much controversy, they were finally regulated by <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> defining accurately the instances in which collation was to be reserved to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. One of the most important reservations which may serve as an example is contained in the ninth rule of the Apostolic Chancery (see APOSTOLIC CHANCERY), which provides that those <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> benefices which fall vacant during eight months of the year are to be at the disposal of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, but that <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who observe the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of residence may freely dispose of all benefices vacated during the six alternate months beginning with February. Today reservations are in effect to some extent throughout the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; for example, they affect the first dignities in chapters in the <a href="12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> and <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; but <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> is the only country in which they are in full operation. Apart from cases provided for in reservations, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> rarely, if ever, exercises his right of extraordinary collation. A collation, whether made by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or by a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, is said to be free when it is not conditioned by any act of an elector or of a patron; <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> when it follows election or <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> by competent <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> or presentation by patrons. In many countries, <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a> have secured to the representatives of <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a> an important part in appointments to benefices. Thus in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> the king nominates to all <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> and <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>; and a similar right has been granted to the Emperor of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and to the King of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>; in <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a> the chapter, before proceeding to the election of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, must allow the Government to cancel the names of those candidates whom it judges unacceptable. Secular intervention in the collation of minor benefices varies from the royal <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the King of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to the governmental <a href="05707a.htm">exequatur</a> required by Italian law. The interests of religion are safeguarded by the canonical requirement that in every case the candidate must be confirmed by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority before he can lawfully begin his incumbency. (For abuses in the collation of benefices, see PATRONAGE, <a href="04155b.htm">COMMENDATORY ABBOTS</a>, <a href="08084b.htm">INVESTITURES</a>.)</p>

<h2>Condition of collation</h2>

<p>In order that benefices may the more effectually fulfill the purposes for which they were instituted, various <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> have been enacted governing the act of collation. Whether the collation be free or <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> it must always be gratuitous, to avoid <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>; free, that is without coaction; unconditional; public, so that it may be readily <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>; and granted within six months from the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of vacancy. Moreover no benefice can be conferred before it is vacant, nor can seculars receive the benefices of regulars, nor regulars those which are secular in character. Plurality of benefices also is forbidden. This last regulation was introduced very early in the history of benefices to assure the faithful execution of the trust attached to <a href="06157b.htm">ecclesiastical foundations</a>, as well as to guard against the evils which follow luxury; but in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> its effectiveness was considerably diminished by a distinction drawn between compatible and incompatible benefices. It was claimed that a benefice which does not require residence is perfectly compatible with one which does, and also that several simple benefices might very properly be held at the same time. This view held sway down to the time of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which ordained that the possession of more than one benefice is lawful only when the first benefice obtained does not suffice for the support of the incumbent, and that in no case should both be residential. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> alone can dispense from the observance of this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. The act of collation is further conditioned by canons requiring certain qualities in the appointee:</p>

<h3 id="A">The clerical state and celibacy</h3>

<p><a href="14779a.htm">Tonsure</a> is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for all benefices, and higher orders must be received by aspirants to important charges; thus <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> are <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to receive within the year the order corresponding to their rank in the sacred college; <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> must have been <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> for at least six months; <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> must receive the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> within a year.</p>

<h3 id="B">Age</h3>

<p>Before the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> a simple benefice could lawfully be conferred on a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a> as early as his seventh year, but since that council the recipient of a simple benefice must be in his fourteenth year, and for double benefices the age of twenty-four years completed is always required. A greater maturity is demanded for certain offices, e.g. thirty years completed for the episcopate, and forty years for the post of canon penitentiary.</p>

<h3 id="C">Character</h3>

<p>The appointee must be of legitimate birth and of good reputation, and free from censure and irregularity.</p>

<h3 id="D">Relative worthiness</h3>

<p>In the case of a choice between several candidates for a <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> or for a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, the collator must appoint the most worthy, i.e. the one who possesses in the highest degree the qualities <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a successful discharge of the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> connected with the benefice in question. The same rule applies to prelacies with quasiepiscopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, to the canon <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> and to the canon penitentiary. As to other benefices authorities differ, the preferable opinion maintaining that in all cases the most worthy is to be chosen.</p>

<h3 id="E">Science</h3>

<p>According to a law of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> (Sess. VII, c. xiii, De ref.) no one can be collated to a benefice unless his fitness has been demonstrated in an examination conducted by the ordinary. In the case of <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> benefices, this examination must take the form of a concursus. (See <a href="04208b.htm">CONCURSUS</a>.) For some appointments the possession of a degree in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> or in canon law is demanded, as evidence of requisite learning; a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be a doctor or a licentiate in canon law or in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or have the public testimony of a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> as to his fitness to teach others; an <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> also must be a doctor or a licentiate in canon law or in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>; and similar qualifications are demanded for other offices. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, is, at the present time, insisting that the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> concerning degrees be faithfully observed.</p>

<h3 id="F">Extraordinary requirements</h3>

<p>These may be imposed by the articles of foundation or by secular law. Founders of benefices are given a great deal of liberty in attaching conditions to the act of collation, provided that these conditions be approved by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. In consequence, it happens at times that only members of a certain <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> or citizens of some town or city are eligible, or even, in some few instances, <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of noble birth. More onerous, and not always acceptable to the church, is the interference of <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> in the matter of collation. In many places only a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> declared acceptable to the Government, or a citizen, or a native, or one who swears fidelity to the Government at the time of appointment, or who receives the royal <a href="05707a.htm">exequatur</a>, can hope to be collated. In <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the permission of the Government is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and without this permission, which is given after an examination by <a href="02137c.htm">secular authorities</a>, a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a> is incapacitated for benefices in these two kingdoms. The <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> law also contains the curious provision that no subject is to enter the German College at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> so long as it is conducted by the <a href="14081a.htm">Fathers of the Society of Jesus</a>, or by any similar order, and that all who contravene this ordinance are to be considered as <em>person&oelig; non grat&oelig;</em> to the Government and excluded from all benefices and posts at its disposal.</p>

<h2>Obligations</h2>

<p>All beneficed <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> are bound to make a profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> within two months from the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of taking possession, to perform faithfully the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> pertaining to their charge, to recite the <a href="07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>, and if the benefice held be double, to reside in the place in which their benefice is located. Violation of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of residence is punished by loss of revenues during the time of absence, and if persisted in, by privation.</p>

<h2>Vacancy</h2>

<p>The tenure of the incumbent of a benefice is perpetual, in the sense that it can be terminated only by death or for causes specified in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. It is provided in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> that in the event of certain acts vacancy shall occur <em>ipso facto;</em> as when the incumbent marries or attempts marriage, when he takes solemn <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> in a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order, when he violates the canon forbidding plurality, when he fails to receive within the prescribed time the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, when he obtains episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, when he is guilty of any crime to which penalty of deprivation is expressly attached. In other cases deprivation follows a judicial process, instituted in virtue of <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> authorizing the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to punish certain offences in this manner. Moreover a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a> has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to resign his benefice provided the resignation be offered freely and for just reasons, and be accepted by a competent superior, and he may also, with certain conditions, exchange benefices with another incumbent.</p>

<h2>Revenues</h2>

<p>The holder of a benefice is not the owner of the foundation from which he derives his support; he occupies in reference to it the position of a tutor or guardian who must defend its interests. His chief <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> is to maintain it as a perpetual means of support for <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of religion. Its fruits or revenues, however, belong to him, but with the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of devoting to <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> causes, and especially to the relief of the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, all that is not needed for his own support. Formerly, this superfluous revenue could not be disposed of by will, but a universal custom has long since authorized such testamentary disposal, provided it be made in favour of <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> causes or of the poor. In fact, in most places on account of the difficulty of distinguishing a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric's</a> patrimonial <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> from his beneficiary revenue, the right is recognized to dispose freely by will of all <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. (See <a href="08571a.htm">JUS SPOLII</a>.)</p>
