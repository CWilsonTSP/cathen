<p>Founded at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> by <a href="11240d.htm">M. Olier</a> (1642) for the purpose of providing directors for the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> established by him (see OLIER). At the founder's death (1657) his <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, approved by religious and <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, was firmly established. The <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> and three in the provinces (Viviers, <a href="09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, Clermont) were opened to young <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to give them besides the elements of the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> lessons and examples in <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> perfection. The work in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> was inaugurated and four <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> appointed to carry it on, while a <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> called the Solitude had been opened to recruit directors for the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Alexandre Le Ragois de Bretonvilliers, the successor of <a href="11240d.htm">Olier</a> (1657-76) drew up the Constitution of the Society and secured its approval by Cardinal Chigi, <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em> and nephew of <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>. The object of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was to labor, in direct dependence on the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and perfection of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. They were to be taught <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, chant and liturgy, but especially <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> payer and the <a href="15472a.htm">Christian virtues</a>. Several chapters dealt with the organization and government of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. The number of subjects should be restricted, fervour being worth more than number. The spiritual and temporal government is vested in a superior general assisted by twelve assistants, like him elected for life. Together they constitute the general assembly empowered to elect by majority of votes the superior-general, his assistants, and among the latter four consultors, who shall be his constant advisers, sign the public acts, and represent the whole <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. The other members are admitted by the superior and his council. They take no <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, but renounce all prospect of eccelesiastical dignities. Changes and appointments are made by the superior-general. Every Sulpician should be animated by great <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the glory of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the sanctification of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, should profess detachment and abnegation, practice poverty, be submissive especially to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<p>De Bretonvilliers transferred the Solitude of Vaugirard to the Ch&acirc;teau d'Avron, which was a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> possession, where it remained until M. Tronson, his successor, established it at Issy, where it is at present. He enacted that the community of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Saint-Sulpice should continue subject to a superior. This community numbered from sixty to eighty members until the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. There <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> exercised the sacred ministry for three years and he spoke from experience when he declared that there was nothing he <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> more than Saint-Sulpice. M. Tronson assumed the direction of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> in 1676 and retained it until 1700. He was remarkable for the breadth of his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, his practical mind, and his deep <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. He was jealously vigilant to ward off the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> scourge from his <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> and the ten <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> under his care. At a time when the <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> since called Gallicanism spread everywhere he was a Roman, as the present expression is, in as far as was compatible with the submission to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> which his <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> professed.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> carried on its work amid the difficulties which <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and philosophism, by corrupting minds, incessantly aroused. Fran&ccedil;ois Leschassier (1700-25) had to defend the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> against <a href="11085b.htm">Archbishop de Noailles</a>, an avowed and militant <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>. Under his successors, Maurice Le Peletier (1725-31) and Jean Couturier (1731-70), although new <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were opened in the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the spirit of the age crept into that of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in consequence of the weakening of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> at the Court, contact with the world, and the great number of sons of the nobility who had become seminarians. At this period Saint-Sulpice was charged with the <a href="05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and even of <em>petits s&eacute;minaires</em> both at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Angers, always with the object of preparing the pupils for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. When the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> broke out the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> alone had trained more than five thousand <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and more than half the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who faced that dreadful tempest (about fifty) had been in Sulpician <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> Claude Bourachot (1770-77) and Pierre Le Gallic (1777-82), who governed with the mournful presentiment of the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, were succeeded by Andre Emery, the man providentially chosen to guide the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> during those dark days. He beheld the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> closed, his brethren scattered, hunted, and compelled to seek safety in exile, but he had the great consolation, at a time of frequent defections, of seeing them all faithful to their promises. Not one of them took the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and eighteen of them died for their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. The life of this illustrious <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> belongs to the whole Church, whose <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> he defended with unshakable firmness against <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> (see EMERY). After the Concordat he reopened the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He should be regarded as the restorer of the Society of <a href="11240d.htm">M. Olier</a>.</p>

<p>During the nineteenth century the Society of Saint-Sulpice has quietly continued its work of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> training while sharing all the vicissitudes of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The following superiors general have governed it: M. Duclaux (1811-26); Garnier (1826-45), a noted Hebrew scholar; de Courson (1845-50); Carri&egrave;re (1850-64), an eminent <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>; Caval (1864-75); J. H. Icard (1879-93); and Captier (1893-1900), the founder and first superior of the <em>procure</em> of Saint-Sulpice at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Living within the walls of its <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, which, constantly increasing, numbered twenty-six in 1900, the Society of Saint-Sulpice has, so to speak, no history. Its members, absorbed in their professional <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, share the life of the seminarians, being solicitous to train them not only in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, but also in <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> virtues, and this more by their own daily examples than by the lessons which they teach. A good Sulpician constitutes himself everywhere and always the companion and the model of the future <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, in their <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises, recreations, meals, and walks, briefly in all the details of their life.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>That such a life is eminently fruitful is <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by the numerous <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, distinguished <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, founders of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, missionaries and religious from Sulpician <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, but it will be readily understood that it furnishes few facts of history. For the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> Saint-Sulpice has been a great <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a>, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of study, regularity, and <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> paid the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> this tribute: "Congregatio Sulpicianorum fuit salus Galliae" (Audience of 10 Jan., 1905, to the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>). The recent persecutions brought about in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by the separation of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> did not fail to attack it. A circular of Minister Combes (1904) declared Saint-Sulpice unfitted to teach in <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. At the same time the old <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> was taken away from it. Nevertheless the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was not dissolved. It subsists in its essential organs, and its members, in most instances in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of their native <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, continue work of devotion to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>At different <a href="04636c.htm">dates</a> the society extended branches to American soil, to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1657, to the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1791. (See <a href="14329d.htm">SULPICIANS IN THE UNITED STATES</a>.)</p>

<p>M. <a href="11240d.htm">Olier</a> had desired to go to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> to work for the conversion of the savages; this he was unable to do, but in union with several <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, among them J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Le Royer de la Dauversi&egrave;re, he founded the Society of Notre-Dame de Montr&eacute;al. The undertaking was inspired by the desire to found a city in honor of the Blessed Virgin (Villemarie in the Island of Montreal) which should serve as headquarters for the <a href="10378a.htm">Indian missions</a> and as a stronghold against the <a href="08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>. The manner in which <a href="16059b.htm">Maisonneuve</a> accomplished this foundation is well known. In 1657 the dying <a href="11240d.htm">Olier</a> sent four of his disciples to the mission of Villemarie, where the colonists were asking for them. They were led by M. De Queylus and thenceforth the Sulpicians shared the vicissitudes of the <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> colony. Two of them, Vignal and Lemaitre, were slain by the <a href="08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> (1660). In 1663 the associates of Notre-Dame, reduced to eight by death and weary of a colony which yielded only expenses, ceded their <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> to the Society of Saint-Sulpice, which was thenceforth owner and lord of the Island of Montreal. It paid 130,000 <em>livres</em> in <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> and pledged itself never to alienate the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the island. M. de Bretonvilliers gave no less than 400,000 <em>livres</em> of his personal fortune for the maintenance of the colony and <a href="05752b.htm">M. Faillon</a> has calculated that from 1657 to 1710 the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> transmitted to that of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> not less than 900,000 <em>livres</em> or one million dollars. Personal devotion was added to these expenses. Eleven Sulpicians were laboring at <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> in 1668, teaching boys, exercising the sacred ministry, or doing missionary work among the savages. MM. Trouv&eacute; and de <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> founded the mission of Kent&eacute; on Lake Ontario. <a href="03407a.htm">Dollier de Casson</a> and Brehan de Gallin&eacute;e explored the region of the Great Lakes (1669), of which they made a map. In 1676 was opened the mission of the Mountain on the site of the present <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, where M. Belmont built a fort (1685). The brandy traffic necessitated the removal of this fixed mission and in 1720 it was transferred to Lac-des-Deux-Montagnes, where it is at present. At the end of the seventeenth century the Sulpicians had created and organized in the vicinity of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> six <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> which they <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> administered, besides supplying them with churches, presbyteries, and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century the history of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> continued closely linked with that of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, in all of whose works it assisted by its resources and devotion. The number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> increased to meet the needs of the time, and at the conquest (1760) they numbered thirty. They were headed by worthy men: <a href="02425a.htm">Vachon de Belmont</a> (1700-31), who succeeded <a href="03407a.htm">Dollier de Casson</a>; Louis Normant du Faradon (1731-59), who assisted <a href="15736c.htm">Ven. M&egrave;re d'Youville</a> in the foundation of the <a href="07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a>; Etienne Montgolfier, who had the difficult task of governing his community during the period of conquest. To the Sulpicians who remained after the Treaty of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1763) the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Saint-Sulpice ceded its possessions in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> on condition that they would carry on the work of <a href="11240d.htm">M. Olier</a>. Being unable to recruit their numbers the Sulpicians of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> would have become extinct had not the English Government humanely opened <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> to the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Twelve Sulpicians reached <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> in 1794. After lengthy disputes the possessions of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> coveted by the English agents were recognized by the British Crown (1840) and the Sulpicians were free to continue undisturbed their work for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. Besides the Coll&egrave;ge de Montr&eacute;al, founded in 1767, and which performed important services after the conquest, they founded a higher <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1840) for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In this house several thousand <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> have been trained for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. They have since founded (1894) for the benefit of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, opened the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> College at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for higher <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> study, and quite recently (1911) have organized the School of <a href="08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a> for the recruiting of <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the <a href="10547b.htm">Archdiocese of Montreal</a>. Since 1866 the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> has gradually abandoned the administration of its <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, at present retaining only those of Notre-Dame and Saint-Jacques in the city and that of Oka in the diocese. That it does not, nevertheless, stand aloof from any of the great undertakings in the city which it founded is manifested by the <a href="09047b.htm">Laval University</a> and the public <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>.</p>

<p>Separated from Saint-Sulpice as regards material possessions, the <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> community maintains its spiritual alliance with <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The superior-general or his representative makes periodically the <a href="15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> of the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> houses. They are governed by a superior elected every five years, who is assisted by a council of twelve, four of whom, called assistants, are his habitual advisers.</p>

<p>As will be readily perceived the principal Sulpician work in both <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and America is that of <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. The Sulpician is either the model of the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> in the ministry or the trainer of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> within the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. His manner of life has been described above; his instruction and method will here be treated briefly. The sole directing principle of the studies at Saint-Sulpice is the most filial docility of judgment and will towards the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, not only when he defines, but when he expresses a preference or gives directions and counsels. Mindful of their responsibility for <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> the Sulpicians teach their pupils, not the novelty which may send them astray, nor their personal opinions which have no guarantee of certitude, but the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> stamped with the seal of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and issuing thence warranted and authentic. In <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> they treat the books they explain as Divine books, avoiding the exaggerations of critical research and abiding by the interpretation of the text. In <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> they set forth the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, at the same time warning their pupils against <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> and <a href="10415a.htm">Modernistic</a> theories and minimizing insinuations. In <a href="01618a.htm">apologetics</a> they follow the historical method; in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> they recognize no master save <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>.</p>

<p>Although the kind of instruction given at Saint-Sulpice tends to produce men whose <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is more solid than brilliant, more deep than extensive, there has been no lack of remarkable professors in any branch of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> learning. Out of the seven hundred and thirty members which the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> had numbered down to 1790 no less than one hundred and fifteen had secured their doctor's degree at the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. Doctrine is surely more valuable than learning, and no book written by a Sulpician has ever been placed on the <a href="07721a.htm">Index</a>. Among the <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> were Delafosse (1701-45) and de Montaigne (1687-1767), who wrote remarkable dogmatic treatises published in the <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of Honor&eacute; Tourn&eacute;ly; Legrand (1711-87), as famous for his dogmatic writings as for his refutation of the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of his time, Rey and Rony, authors of valuable treatises published at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>; Peala (1787-1853), the continuator of the ecclesiastical conferences of <a href="09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>; Vieusse (1784-1857), author of the "Compendiosae institutiones theologicae" of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>; Carri&egrave;re (1795-1864), author of authoritative treatises on marriage, contracts, <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, etc.; Vincent (1813-69), author of the so-called "Clermont Theology". De Lantages (1616-94) and De la Ch&eacute;tardye (1634-1714) wrote justly-esteemed catechisms and conversations or <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> instructions. Among the Sulpicians whose works were addressed to the general faithful were Blanlo (1617-57), author of "Enfance chr&eacute;tienne"; Guisain (1627-82), author of the "Sages entretiens" of a <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> desirous of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>; Lasausse (1740 1826), author of many works of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>; Hamon (1795-1874), whose "Meditations" are much used; Riche (1824-92), author of works intended to assist <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. Among those who had chiefly in view the perfection of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were, after <a href="11240d.htm">Olier</a> himself, M. Tronson (1622-1700), whose "Examens particuliers" is a masterpiece of spiritual <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> and whose "Forma cleri", treatise on obedience, and other works are useful to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>; Fyot de Vaugimois (1689-1758), who wrote "Conversations with Jesus Christ before and after Mass" (1721), very popular at that time, and a host of other works for the sanctification of priests; Boyer (1768-1842), the author of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> retreats; Vernet (1760-1843), who wrote many works to enliven the <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> of religious and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, such as the "Nepotien"; Hamon (1795-1870), the biographer of Cardinal <a href="03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> and <a href="06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>; Galais (1802-54), "Le bon s&eacute;minariste" (1839); Renaudet (1794-1880), wrote various works on asceticism, also meditations; Gamon (1813-86), author of the lives of holy priests; Bacuez (1820-92), "Manuel du s&eacute;minariste en vacances".</p>
