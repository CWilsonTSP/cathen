<p>The first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> appear to have been the missionaries of Ili B&acirc;liq in Central <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>, Khan-B&acirc;lig (Peking), and Zaitun (Fu-kien), in the middle of the fourteenth century. <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a> had been introduced into Central <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, the native dynasty of Ming, replacing the Mongol dynasty of Yuan, had not followed the policy of toleration of their predecessors; the Hungarian, Matthew Escandel, being possibly the first <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>.</p>

<p>With the revival of the missions in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> with <a href="13034a.htm">Matteo Ricci</a>, who died at Peking in 1610, the blood of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was soon shed to fertilize the evangelical field; the change of the Ming dynasty to the Manchu dynasty, giving occasion for new prosecution. Andrew Xavier (better known as Andrew Wolfgang) Koffler (b. at Krems, Austria, 1603), a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and companion of Father Michel Boym, in the Kwang-si province, who had been very successful during the Ming dynasty, was killed by the Manchu invaders on 12 December, 1651. On 9 May, 1665, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Domingo Coronado, died in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> at Peking. Sometime before, a <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Francisco Fernandez, of the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Valladolid, had been <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> on 15 January, 1648. Among the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> must be reckoned the celebrated <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="13520a.htm">Johann Adam Schall von Bell</a> (T'ang Jo-wang), who was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and ill-treated during the Manchu conquest. They were the first victims in modern times.</p>

<p>After publication by a <em>literato</em>, of a <a href="09210a.htm">libel</a> against the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Fu-ngan, in Fu-kien, the viceroy of the province gave orders to inquire into the state of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, the result of which was that a dreadful prosecution broke out in 1746, during the reign of Emperor K'ien lung, the victims of which were all <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>; the following were arrested: Juan Alcober (b. at Girone in 1649); Francisco Serrano, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14738a.htm">Tipasa</a>, and coadjutor the <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>; and Francisco Diaz (b. in 1712, at Ecija); finally the <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>; Pedra Martyr Sanz (b. in 1680, at Asco, Tortosa), <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mauricastra, and Joachim Royo (b. at Tervel in 1690) surrendered. After they had been cruelly tortured, the viceroy sentenced them to death on 1 November, 1746; Sanz was <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> on 26 May, 1747; his companions shared his fate; the five <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, on 14 May, 1893. Shortly after, a fresh prosecution broke out in the Kiang-nan province, and the two <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a>, Antoine-Joseph Henriquez (b. 13 June, 1707), and Tristan de Attimis (b. in Friuli, 28 July, 1707), were thrown into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> with a great number of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, including young girls, who were ill-treated; finally the viceroy of Nan-king sentenced to <a href="12565a.htm">death</a> the two missionaries, who were strangled on 12 September, 1748. In 1785, the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> brother, Atto Biagini (b. at Pistoia, 1752), died in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> at Peking.</p>

<p>Persecution was very severe during the Kia K'ing period (1796-1820); Louis-Gabriel-Taurin Dufresse (b. at Ville de L&eacute;zoux, Bourbonnais, 1751), of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tabraca (24 July, 1800, and <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Sze ch'wan, was beheaded in this province on 14 September, 1815. In 1819, a new prosecution took place in the Hu-pe Province; Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois-Regis Clet (b. at <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, 19 April, 1748), and aged <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, was betrayed by a renegade, arrested in Ho-nan, and thrown in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> at Wu ch'ang in Oct., 1819; he was strangled on 18 Feb., 1820, and twenty-three <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were, at the same time, sentenced to perpetual banishment; another <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, Lamiot, who had also been arrested, being the emperor's interpreter, was sent back to Peking; the Emperor Kia K'ing died shortly after; Father Clet was <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1900.</p>

<p>Under the reign of Emperor Tas Kwang, another <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> was also the victim of the Mandarin of Hu-pe; also betrayed by a Chinese renegade, <a href="08327a.htm">Jean-Gabriel Perboyre</a> (b. at Puech, <a href="03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, on 6 Jan., 1802), was tranferred to Wu ch'ang like Clet; during several months, he endured awful tortures, and was finally strangled on 11 September, 1870; he was <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> on 10 November, 1889. Father d'Addosio has written in Chinese, in 1887, a life of <a href="08327a.htm">Perboyre</a>; full bibliographical details are given of these two <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in "Bibliotheca Sinica".</p>

<p>Just after the French treaty of 1844, stipulating free exercises of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Hu-pe, Giuseppe Rizzolati, was expelled, and Michel Navarro (b. at <a href="06723a.htm">Granada</a>, 4 June, 1809, was arrested; a <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> missionary, Laurent Carayon was taken back from Chi-li to Macao (June, 1846), while <a href="07510a.htm">Huc</a> and Gabet were compelled to leave Lhasa, the capital of <a href="14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, on 26 February, 1846, and forcibly conducted to Canton. The death of Father August Chapdelaine, of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions (b. at <a href="09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, <a href="04455b.htm">Diocese of Coutances</a>, 6 Jan., 1814, beheaded on 29 Feb., 1856, at Si-lin-hien, in the Kwang-si province), was the pretext chosen by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, to join <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in a <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>; when peace was restored by a treaty signed at Tien-tsin in June, 1858, it was stipulated by a separate article that the Si-lin mandarin guilty of the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> of the French missionary should be degraded, and disqualified for any office in the future. On 27 Feb., 1857, Jean-Victor Muller, of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions, was arrested in Kwang-tung; an indemnity of 200 dollars was paid to him; he was finally <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the rebels at Hing-yi-fu, on 24 April, 1866. On 16 August, 1860, the T'ai-p'ing rebel chief, the Chung Wang, accompanied by the Kan Wang, marched upon Shanghai; on 17th, his troops entered the village of Tsa ka wei, where the <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a> of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Luigi de Massa (b. at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 3 March, 1827) was situated; the father was killed with a number of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>; they were no less than five brothers belonging to the Napolitan <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Massa, all <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>: Augustin (b. 16 March, 1813; d. 15 August, 1856), Nicolas (b. 30 Jan., 1815; d. 3 June, 1876), Ren&eacute; (b. 14 May, 1817; d. 28 April, 1853), Gaetano (b. 31 Jan., 1821; d. 28 April, 1850), and Luigi. Two years later, another <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit father</a>, Victor Vuillaume (b. 26 Dec., 1818), was <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> on 4 March, 1862, at Ts'ien Kia, Kiangsu province, by order of the Shanghai authorities.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>At the beginning of 1861, Jean-Joseph Fenouil (b. 18 Nov., 1821 at Rudelle, Cahors), later <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14506b.htm">Tenedos</a>, and <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Yun-nan, was captured by the Lolo savages of Ta Leang Shan, and ill-treated being mistaken for a Chinaman. On 1 Sept., 1854, Nicolas-Michel Krick (b. 2 March, 1819, at Lixheim), of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions, missionary to <a href="14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>, with Fater Bourry, in the country of the Abors. On 18 Feb., 1862, Jean-Pierre N&eacute;el (b. at Sainte-Catherine-sur-Riv&eacute;rie, <a href="09472a.htm">Diocese of Lyons</a>, June, 1832), <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions, was beheaded at Kaichou (Kweichou). Gabriel-Marie Piere Durand (b. at Lunel, on 31 Jan., 1835), of the same order, missionary to <a href="14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, in trying to escape his prosecutors, fell into the Salwein river and was drowned on 28 Sept., 1865.</p>

<p>On 29 August, 1865, Fran&ccedil;ois Mabileau (b. 1 March, 1829, at Paimboeuf), of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions, was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Yew yang chou, in Eastern Sze Chw'an; four years later, Jean-Francois Rigaud (b. at Arc-et-Senans) was killed on 2 Jan., 1869, at the same place. Redress was obtained for these crimes by the French Legation at Peking. In Kwang-tung, Fathers Verch&eacute;re (1867), Dejean (1868), Delavay (1869), were prosecuted; Gilles and <a href="09106a.htm">Lebrun</a> were ill-treated (1869-1870). Things came to a climax in June, 1870: rumours had been afloat that children had been kidnapped by the missionaries and the sisters at T'ien-tsin; the <em>che-fu</em>, instead of calming the people, was exciting them by posting bills hostile to foreigners; the infuriated mob rose on 20 June, 1870: the French consul, Fontainer, and his chancellor Simon, were <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> at the Yamun of the imperial commissioner, Ch'ung Hou; the church of the <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> was pillaged and burnt down: Father Chevrier was killed with a Cantonese <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, Vincent Hu, the French interpreter, <a href="14697c.htm">Thomassin</a> and his wife, a French merchant, Challemaison and his wife; inside the native town, ten sisters of St. Vincent of Paul were <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> in the most cruel manner, while on the other side of the river, the Russian merchants, Bassof and Protopopoff with his wife, were also <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> there was an outcry from all the foreign communities. It may be said that this awful crime were never punished; <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> was involved in her gigantic struggle with <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and she had to be content with the punishment of the supposed murderers, and with the apology brought to St-Germain by the special embassy of Ch'ung hou, who at one time had been looked upon as one of the instigators of the massacre. Jean Hue (b. 21 Jan., 1837), was massacred with a <a href="03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> on 5 Sept., 1873, at Kien-Kiang in Sze chw'an; another <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions, Jean-Joseph-Marie Baptifaud (b. 1 June, 1845), was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Pienkio, in the Yun-nan province during the night of 16-17 September, 1874. The secretary of the French legation, Guilaume de Roquette, was sent to Sze ch'wan, and after some protracted negotiations, arranged that two murderers should be executed, and indemnity paid and some mandarins punished (1875).</p>

<p>In the article <a href="03663b.htm">CHINA</a> we have related the Korean massacres of 1839, and 1866; on 14 May, 1879, Victor Marie Deguette, of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions, was arrested in the district of Kung-tjyou, and taken to Seoul; he was released at the request of the French minister at Peking; during the preceding year the <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Korea, Mgr Ridel, one of the survivors of the massacre of 1866, had been arrested and sent back to <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>. On Sunday, 29 July, 1894, Father Jean-Mo&iuml;se Jozeau (b. 9 Feb., 1866), was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> in Korea. There <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions were the next victims: Jean-Baptiste-Honor&eacute; Brieux was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> near Ba-t'ang, on 8 Sept., 1881; in April, 1882, Eug&egrave;ne Charles Brugnon was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>; Jean-Antoine Louis Terrasse (b. at Lantriac, Haute-Loire) was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> with seven <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> at Chang In-Yun'nan province, during the night of 27-28 March, 1883; the culprits were flogged and banished, and an indemnity of 50,000 taels was paid. Some time before, Louis-Dominique Conraux, of the same order (b. 1852) was arrested and tortured in <a href="09585a.htm">Manchuria</a> at Hou Lan. On 1 November, 1897, at eleven o'clock in the evening, a troop of men belonging to the Ta Tao Hwei, the great "Knife Association", an anti-foreign <a href="14071b.htm">secret society</a>, attacked the German mission (<a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Steyl), in the village of Chang Kia-chwang (Chao-chou prefecture), where Fathers Francis-Xavier Nies (b. 11 June, 1859, at Recklinghausen, <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>), Richard Henle (b. 21 July, 1863, at Stetten, near Kaigerloch, Sigmaringen), and Stenz were asleep; the latter escaped, but the other two were killed. This double <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> led to the occupation of Kiao-chou, on 14 Nov., 1897, by the German fleet: the Governor of Shan-tung, Li Peng-heng was replaced by the no less <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a> Yu Hien. On 21 April, 1898, Mathieu Bertholet (b. at Charbonnier, Puy de Dome, 12 June, 1865), was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> in the Kwang-si province at Tong-Kiang chou; he belonged to the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions.</p>

<p>In July, 1898, two French missionaries were arrested at Yung chang in Sza-ch'wan, by the bandit Yu Man-tze already sentenced to <a href="12565a.htm">death</a> in Jan., 1892, at the request of the French legation; one of the missionaries escaped wounded; but the other, Fleury (b. 1869), was set at liberty only on 7 Jan., 1899. On 14 October, 1898, Henri Chan&eacute;s (b. 22 Sept., 1865, at Coubon-sur-Loire), of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions, was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Pak-tung (Kwang-tung), with several native <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>; the Chinese had to pay 80,000 dollars. In the same year, on 6 Dec., the <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Jean Delbrouck (brother Victorin, b. at Boirs, 14 May, 1870), was arrested and beheaded on 11 Dec., his body being cut to pieces; by an agreement signed on 12 Dec., 1899, by the French consul at Hankou, 10,000 taels were paid for the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a>, and 44,500 tales for the destruction of churches, buildings, etc. in the prefectures of I-ch'ang and Sha-nan. The most appalling disaster befell the <a href="03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> in 1900 during the Boxer rebellion: at Peking, the <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarist</a>, Jules Garrigues (b. 23 June, 1840), was burnt with his church, the Tung-Tang; Dor&eacute; (b. at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 15 May, 1862) was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>, and his church the Si Tang, destroyed; two Marist brethren were killed at Sha-la-eul; Father d'Addosio (b. at <a href="02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, 19 Dec., 1835), who left the French legation to look after the foreign troops who had entered Peking, was caught by the Boxers, and <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a>; another <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, Chavanne (b. at St. Chamond, 20 August, 1862), wounded by a shot during the siege, died of smallpox on 26 July.</p>

<p>In the Chi-li province, the following <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> suffered for their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>: Modeste Andlauer (b. at Rosheim, Alsace, 1847); Remis Isor&eacute; (b. 22 Jan., 1852, at Bambecque, Nord); Paul Denn (b. 1 April, 1847, at <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a>); Ignace Mangin (b. 30 July, 1857, at Verny, Lorraine).

Maria in Valle, Trevi); Cesada; and Joseph: in the Hu-pe province, the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Ebert; in the Shan-si province, where the <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a> Yu hien, subsequently beheaded, ordered a wholesale massacre of missionaries both <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, at T'ai yuan: Gregorio Grassi (b. at Castellazzo, 13 Dec., 1833, <a href="15401b.htm">vicar apostolic</a>; his coadjutor, Francisco Fogolla (b. at Motereggio, 4 Oct., 1839), <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bagi; Fathers Facchini, Saccani, Theodoric Balat, Egide, and Brother Andrew Bauer, all <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>.

<p>The <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Missions (Congregation of Scheut), numbered also many <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>: Ferdinant Hamer (b. at Nimegue, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 21 August, 1840; burnt to death in <a href="08602c.htm">Kan-su</a>), the first <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the province; in <a href="10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>: Joseph Segers (b. at Saint Nicolas, Waes, 20 Oct., 1869); Herman; Mallet; Jaspers; Zylmans; <a href="01007d.htm">Abbeloos</a>, Dobbe. The cemeteries, at Peking especially, were <a href="04748c.htm">desecrated</a>, the graves opened and, the remains scattered abroad. Seven cemeteries (one British, five French, and one mission), situated in the neighbourhood of Peking has been <a href="04748c.htm">desecrated</a>. By Article IV of the Protocol signed at Peking, 7 Sept., 1901, it was stipulated: "The <a href="03663b.htm">Chinese</a> government has agreed to erect an expiatory monument in each of the foreign or international cemeteries, which were <a href="04748c.htm">desecrated</a>, and in which the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> were destroyed. It has been agreed with the Representatives of the Powers, that the Legations interested shall settle the details for the erection of these monuments, <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> bearing all the expenses thereof, estimated at ten thousand taels for the cemeteries at Peking and in its neighbourhood, and at five thousand taels for the cemeteries in the provinces." The amounts have been paid. Notwithstanding these negotiations, Hippolyte Julien (b. 16 July, 1874) of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> on 16 Jan., 1902, at Ma-tze-hao, in the Kwang Tung province.</p>

<p>In 1904, Mgr. Theotime Verhaegen, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Southern Hu-pe (b. 1867), was killed with his brother, at Li-Shwan. A new massacre of several missionaries of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Foreign Missions including Father Jean-Andr&eacute; Souli&eacute; (b. 1858), took place in 1905 in the Mission of Tibet (western part of the province of Sze-chw'an). Finally we shall record the death of the Marist Brother, Louis Maurice, <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Nan ch'ang on 25 Feb., 1906.</p>

<p>A long and sad list, to which might be added the names of many others, whose sufferings for the Faith of Christ have not been recorded.</p>
