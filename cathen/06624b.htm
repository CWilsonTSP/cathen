<p>Duke of Lower Lorraine and first King of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, son of Eustache II, Count of Boulogne, and of Ida, daughter of Godfrey the Bearded, Duke of Lower Lorraine; b. probably at Boulogne-sur-Mer, 1060; d. at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 18 July, 1100 (according to a thirteenth-century chronicler, he was born at Baisy, in Brabant; see Haigner&eacute;, M&eacute;moires lus &agrave; la Sorbonne, Paris, 1868, 213). The history of his early years has been distorted by legend, according to which he slew with his own hand the anti-king Rodolphe at the battle of Moelsen (1080), and was first to enter <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> after it had been besieged by <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> (1084). What appears <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> is that he was chosen to succeed his uncle Godfrey the Hunchback, Duke of Lower Lorraine, who was assassinated in 1076. But <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> took Lorraine, leaving to Godfrey only the marquessate of <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. As a vassal of the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a> Godfrey took sides with the army of <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> in the <a href="08084c.htm">War of the Investitures</a> and followed the emperor on his expedition to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> against <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (1080-1084). In the interval he was compelled to return in order to defend his possessions which had been attacked by the Count of <a href="10679a.htm">Namur</a>, and about 1089 <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> restored to him the legacy of Godfrey the Hunchback by creating him Duke of Lower Lorraine. The new duke's authority was extremely weak when opposed to the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> power which had developed in the vicinity. At this time the whole north of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> was aroused by the letter of <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, who besought the nobility of <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a> to go on the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. Godfrey was among the first to take the cross, together with his two brothers, Eustache and Baldwin (1096). To procure resources he sold or pledged many of his estates. Many nobles at once arrayed themselves under his banner, and about 15 August, 1096, he departed at the head of 10,000 <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a> and 30,000 foot soldiers. His army was composed of Walloons and Flemings. "Born at the frontier of the two nations and himself speaking both languages", he served as the link between them, and by his authority appeased the quarrels provoked by their national self-esteem (<a href="11358b.htm">Otto of Freisingen</a>, Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script., XX, 250).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> reached the valley of the Danube and in September, 1096, arrived at Tollenburch (Tulin, west of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>), on the frontier of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, where they learned of the disaster that had befallen the followers of Peter the <a href="07280a.htm">Hermit</a>. Before entering <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> Godfrey negotiated with King Coloman for a free passage through his dominions. He himself met the king, who welcomed him warmly, but took Godfrey's brother Baldwin as a hostage, together with his wife. During the march through <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (October, 1096) the strictest disciplines prevailed among the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, to whom the inhabitants furnished provisions in abundance. After crossing the Save, the army entered the territory of the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. At Belgrade Godfrey received a letter from the Emperor Alexius I (Comnenus), promising him assistance if the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> would refrain from <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a>. At Nish and at Sterniz (Sofia), they found abundant provisions and presents from the emperor. After a halt of eight days at Philippopolis (26 Nov.-3 Dec.) the army approached Adrianople (8 December) and marched towards the Hellespont. Here occurred the first conflict between the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> and the imperial government. According to <a href="01261d.htm">Albert of Aix</a>, Godfrey, learning that the emperor held in captivity Hugues, a prince of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, demanded the latter's freedom, and on the emperor's refusal pillaged the neighborhood of Salabria (Selymbria). As a matter of fact, the French prince was not a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, but Godfrey and his army arrived before Constantinople (23 Dec., 1096) in a hostile mood, and closely watched by the imperial troops. Warned against the emperor, Godfrey kept away from the imperial palace.</p>

<p>However, during the <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a> festivities, he consented to cross the Golden Horn, and went into camp at Pera (29 Dec.). The chief desire of Alexius was to prevent the junction of Godfrey's army with that of Bohemond, leader of the Normans of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; Alexius had hoped to induce Godfrey to swear fealty to him and then to remove his army to <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Throughout the winter Godfrey resisted the imperial demands. At last, 2 April, 1097 (the date given by Anna Comnena is preferable to 13 January given by <a href="01261d.htm">Albert of Aix</a>; see Chalandon, "Alexis Comn&egrave;ne", 179), on the approach of Bohemond, the emperor decided to act, and cut off the supplies of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. Several combats ensued, and, despite the contrary assertion of <a href="01261d.htm">Albert of Aix</a>, Godfrey must have been defeated. Anna Comnena states that he then consented to do homage to the emperor, promising to restore him any former imperial possessions which he might wrest from the infidels. Some days later the <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> army was conveyed to Pelekan on the Gulf of <a href="11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, and at the end of April all the leaders of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> were reunited. Godfrey appears to have acted as peacemaker, and he induced Raymond IV, of St-Gilles, Count of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, to swear fealty to the emperor. Far from directing the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>, he appears to have taken an obscure part in the siege of Nic&aelig;a and the battle of Doryl&aelig;um (1 July, 1097).</p>

<p>During the crossing of <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> he was seriously wounded while hunting. At the siege of Antioch he consented to obey the orders of Bohemond, and after the capture of the city he had to give up the castle which his followers had taken (July, 1098). On the way to Jerusalem. while others quarrelled, Godfrey marched towards <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, where his brother, Baldwin, had just established himself. He returned from this expedition in October, 1098, and before entering Antioch, with only twelve <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>, put to flight one hundred and fifty <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. According to the tradition repeated by Guibert de Nogent (Gesta, VII, 11), he had, with a stroke of the sword, hewn a <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> horseman through the middle so that his body fell in two equal halves. Having returned to <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, he took part, together with Robert Courte-Heuse, Duke of Normandy, in the council of arbitration assembled to reconcile Bohemond and Raymond of St-Gilles. After 23 November, 1098, a number of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> left Antioch with Raymond, but Godfrey of Bouillon and Robert, Count of <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, began to march on <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> only at the end of February, 1099. After besieging Gibel they rejoined the main army before Arka (12 March), were at Tripoli (13 May), Beirut (19 May), C&aelig;sarea (30 May), and reached <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> on 7 June.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Godfrey and his army took an active part in the siege of the Holy City. His camp was pitched to the westward. On 15 July, 1099, about nine in the morning, Godfrey and his brother Eustache placed a movable tower against the walls and were the first to enter the city. During the ensuing massacre of <a href="10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, Godfrey, thinking only of his <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a>, stripped himself of his arms, and, barefooted and in his under-garments, made the rounds of the ramparts, and then went to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> at the Holy Sepulchre. The <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> were soon intent on providing a new king for the conquest. Several <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> offered the crown to Raymond of St-Gilles, who refused, declaring "that the title of king seemed to him out of place in that city" (Raimond de Aguilers, Histor. Occid. des Crois., III, 301). Robert Courte-Heuse being urged declined in like manner. All refused to accept the burden which the new royalty must prove. Finally, Godfrey, being unanimously elected, accepted "for the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (22 July). According to the chronicles of those times, he refused to wear the crown "through respect for Him who had been <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> in that place with the Crown of Thorns". Indeed, he seems never to have borne the title of king (which only appears under his successor), and to have been content with that of <em>Duke</em> and <em>Advocate of the Holy Sepulchre</em>.</p>

<p>It may be that he acted in this manner through respect for the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who regarded the new conquest as the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of all <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and some of whom were averse to the election of a king (Raimond de Aguilers, Hist. Occid. Crois., III, 295). Godfrey seems to have always considered himself the protector of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Not only did he make so many donations that <a href="15639a.htm">William of Tyre</a> despairs of enumerating them, not only did he cede a fourth of <a href="08268a.htm">Jaffa</a> (Joppa), the city of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the tower of <a href="04642b.htm">David</a> to the patriarch Daimbert, but he consented, as did Bohemond, to receive investiture from the patriarch (<a href="15639a.htm">William of Tyre</a>, Historia, IX, XV). Godfrey displayed great energy in meeting the many difficulties which threatened the new State, but he was destined to succumb to sickness. On 12 August, 1099, having rallied the <a href="04543c.htm">crusading</a> forces, he gained a victory at <a href="01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, thus preserving Palestine from <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> invasion.</p>

<p>Assisted by the <a href="12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, he rebuilt the city of <a href="08268a.htm">Jaffa</a>, which became a port of arrival for <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. He signed a treaty of alliance with the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> fleet, agreeing to besiege Acre, but was attacked by the plague at C&aelig;sarea, 10 June. After a short stay at the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> which he had founded at <a href="08268a.htm">Jaffa</a>, he returned to Jerusalem, where he died on 18 July, having named his brother Baldwin as his successor. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in the church of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>The <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Godfrey was destroyed in 1808, but at that time a large sword, said to have been his, was still shown. Legend soon laid claim to him; in the contemporary accounts of the <a href="04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> (Gesta Francorum, Raimond de Aguilers, Foucher de Chartres, Anna Comnena, etc.), he is portrayed as the perfect type of a <a href="03691a.htm">Christian knight</a>. Tall of stature, with pleasing countenance, and with so courteous a manner "that he seemed more a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> than a <a href="03691a.htm">knight</a>" (Robert the Monk, Hist. Occid. Crois., III, 731), in the hour of danger he showed admirable <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>. As a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he was among the first to take the cross, accomplished his <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> without the slightest deviation, and at great personal cost accepted the defence of the new conquest. Such is Godfrey as he appears in actual history. In the chronicle of <a href="01261d.htm">Albert of Aix</a> (d. 1120, edit. Hist. Occid. Crois., IV), the author already exhibits a tendency to put the figure of Godfrey in the foreground and to attribute to him, to a certain extent, the direction of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>. <a href="01261d.htm">Albert of Aix</a> and Guibert de Nogent attribute to Godfrey exploits of an epic character (Guibert de Nogent, Gesta, VII, 11). When, in the thirteenth century, Jean d'Ibelin and Philip of <a href="11134b.htm">Novara</a> edited the "Assises" of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, they referred to Godfrey as a law-making king, and attributed to him a code, the "Letters of the Holy Sepulchre", which never existed. Indeed, at that time, and perhaps as early as the twelfth century, Godfrey of Bouillon had become, like Roland and Arthur, a hero of the <em>chansons de geste</em>. The <em>trouv&egrave;res</em> provided him with a mythical origin, making him a descendant of the legendary "King of the Swan", whose feats he is made to repeat, and, after relating the events of his childhood, continued his adventures to the taking of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Under <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>, Graindor of <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> reconstructed the works of a certain Richard the Pilgrim, and composed a complete history of this <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>: (1) "Elioxe", ed. Todd (Baltimore, 1889); (2) "Beatrix", ed. Hippeau (Paris, 1868); (3) "Antioche", ed. P. <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (Paris, 1848); (4) "J&eacute;rusalem", ed. Hippeau (Paris, 1868); see L.
