<p>An institution originated (1874) by J. Roosevelt Bailey, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, for the protection and promotion of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian mission interests in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States of America</a>. The <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> Government holds the Indians as its wards and, accordingly, supervises them in all their internal and external relations. Consequently, missionaries, philanthropists, traders and others who have to do with the Indians or who live among them, are <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to approach them through these governmental channels, and to conduct all negotiations with them under permission and direction of Government Indian officials. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian mission interests being extensive, varied, and scattered over many states and <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, as a measure of expediency bordering closely on necessity, established, at the seat of Government, the Bureau of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Missions, through which to transact the affairs of the missions with the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> Indian Office&mdash;the director of the Bureau being the mouthpiece of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and of the missionaries in their official relations, regarding Indian matters, with the Government. In order to do its work intelligently and effectively, the Bureau excercises a limited supervision over the missions and mission-institutions. At the present time the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and missionaries, generally speaking, look to the Bureau for support of the mission <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and for material assistance in maintaining and establishing missions. To meet these needs, the Bureau, through various agencies, solicits <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> for the missions from the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body (Indian and white) throughout the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The Bureau comprises: a board of incorporators&mdash;the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (president), James Cardinal Gibbons; <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Philadelphia, Patrick J. Ryan; <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York, Most Rev. John M. Farley; a director, Rev. Wm. H. Ketcham; a treasurer, Very Rev. E. R. Dyer, S.S.; a secretary, Charles S. Lusk; a legal advisor, Hon. Charles J. Bonaparte; a field-lecturer, Rev. Charles Warren Currier. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and Philadelphia and the director form the executive board. As for the greater portion of the Indian population, the advent of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionary antedates that of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> Government. Prior to the creation of the Bureau, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian affairs were adjusted locally between <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and missionaries and Indian agents and other Government officials. Tired of destructive and expensive Indian <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, and realizing that the western Indians could not be kept in a pacific state by money or promises, President Grant looked for the solution of the Indian problem in the Christianizing of the tribes. Accordingly he announced to Congress (5 December, 1870) his "Indian Peace Policy";&mdash;"Indian agencies being civil offices, I determined to give all the agencies to such <a href="13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> as had heretofore established missionaries among the Indians, and perhaps to some other <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> who would undertake the work on the same terms&mdash;i.e., as a missionary work". This plan to give the agencies over to "such <a href="13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> <em>as had heretofore established missionaries among the Indians</em>" was fair and practicable and might have proved successful had it been carried out impartially. In 1870 there were seventy-two Indian agencies, and in <em>thirty-eight</em> of these, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries had been the <em>first to establish themselves</em>. Despite this fact, only <em>eight</em>&mdash;Colville and Tulalip in Washington Territory, Umatilla and Grand Ronde in <a href="11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, Flathead in <a href="10516b.htm">Montana</a>, Standing Rock and Devil's Lake in <a href="11111b.htm">Dakota</a>, Papago in Arizona &mdash; were assigned to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Eighty thousand <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians passed from <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> influences to <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> control.</p>

<p>This condition necessitated vigorous defensive measures on the part of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. At the instance of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in whose <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> were Indians, Archbishop Bailey, on 2 January, 1874, appointed General Charles Ewing <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Commissioner. The same year, the Very Rev. J. B. A. Brouillet, <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the Diocese of Nesqually, was called to Washington to assist General Ewing. In 1875, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ladies of the city of Washington organized the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Missionary Association. Father Brouillet became the director and treasurer of The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Mission Work. In 1879, the Bureau was officially created with General Ewing, commissioner, Father Brouillet, director, and Rev. Felix Barotti, treasurer. On 13 June, 1879, the <a href="12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of the Propaganda</a> gave a letter of commendation in favour of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Missionary Work. Father Barotti died in 1881 and was succeeded as treasurer by Charles S. Jones of Washington D.C. On 14 June, 1881, the Bureau was incorporated under the general incorporation law of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. On 1 June, 1877, <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> created General Ewing a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. On General Ewing's death (1883), Captain John Mullan of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> was appointed <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Commissioner. Father Brouillet died in 1884 and Rev. J. A. Stephan was appointed director. By a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Third <a href="02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, the Bureau was formally recognized as an institution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and placed under a committee of five <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>: James Cardinal Gibbons, Most Rev. Patrick W. Riordan, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, Right Rev. James A. Healy, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="02798a.htm">Right Rev. John B. Brondel</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07203a.htm">Helena</a>, and Right Rev. Martin Marty, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14016b.htm">Sioux Falls</a> &mdash; (in 1893 this committee was increased to seven by the addition of Most Rev. Patrick J. Ryan, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Philadelphia, and Most Rev. Placide L. Chapelle, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Sante Fe). The committee of five made appointments as follows: president, Right Rev. Martin Marty; vice-president Most Rev. Placide L. Chapelle; director, Rev. J. A. Stephen; assistant director, Rev. George L. Willard; treasurer, Rev. J. A. Walter.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1894 the committee of regents was dissolved and the Bureau reconstituted. The old organization was superseded by a new corporation chartered in perpetuity by an Act of the General Assembly of the State of Maryland (approved 6 April, 1894), the <a href="01691a.htm">Most Rev. Archbishops</a> of Baltimore, New York, and Philadelphia being the incorporators, and the corporate title, The Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions.</p>

<p>Under the new organization Bishop Marty was retained as president and at his death (1896) was succeeded by Cardinal Gibbons. Right Rev. Monsignor J. A. Stephans was director until his death in 1901. The office of assistant director, vacant since 1890, was successively filled by Rev. B. J. Kelly and Rev. E. H. Fitzgerald. The treasurer, appointed in 1894, still remains in office (1909), and also the secretary who, as private secretary to General Ewing, has in reality served as secretary to the Bureau since its inception.</p>

<h2>Work of the bureau</h2>

<p>The Indian Peace Policy was in force from 1874 to 1882, but even after its discontinuance the need for the Bureau remained imperative. Being constantly in touch with the officials of the Indian Office, the Bureau has been instrumental in ameliorating the condition of the Indian, and in making tolerable the lot of the missionary, who, at all times, has been under close and galling Governmental supervision, and, in many instances, subjected to annoyance, humiliations, and petty persecutions on the part of the Indian agents and agency employees. From 1874 to 1879 the Government refused to concede to all <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> an equal right to go upon Indian reservations. For this sole reason a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionary was expelled from a reservation assigned to <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and in 1880 the Indian Office declared itself unable to grant a permit for a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionary to go upon a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> reservation, though the fact that the reservation was under <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> control did not signify that the Indians were <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The same year, by order of the Department, a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionary was expelled from a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> agency (Devil's Lake). This brought a change in popular sentiment which, together with the agitation kept up by the Bureau, caused the recognition, rather theoretical than actual, of religious liberty for Indians and Indian missionaries. Even yet the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, so far as Indians are concerned, are often violated, particularly in the case of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian pupils attending Government <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</p>

<p>A fund known as the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Mission Fund, created chiefly by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Missionary Association and partly by charitable donations and bequests, provided support for the Bureau up to 1887, and supplied it with means to assist the missions. During the twenty-two years following its organization, it received and disbursed from this fund $48,717.88. All the officers of the bureau serve without salary, with the exception of the director, secretary, and field-lecturer. The salaries and running-expenses of the Bureau since 1887 have been provided from the annual <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> collections for Indian and <a href="12627a.htm">Negro</a> missions. The influence of the Bureau for good has steadily increased. President Roosevelt recognized the value of the institution and during the present administration (1909) it has received marked consideration.</p>

<p>Impartial observers of Indian affairs admit that the greatest good accomplished for the Indian has been through the agency of religious <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and particularly of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and it is in this cause the Bureau has done its best work. In 1873, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries and sisters had charge of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> government <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> (two boarding and five day) supported out of the U. S. treasury at a cost of $8000. Only in this was was help received from the Government by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries and Sisters until 1877. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian mission and <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> work was kept up in a measure by funds collected and disbursed by the Bureau. In 1877 the bureau made application to the Government for contracts for the support and tuition of Indian pupils in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. This application was favourably received and the "Contract School System" came into being. Not less than $1,500,000 to erect and equip <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> buildings were furnished by the daughters of <a href="05159a.htm">Francis A. Drexel</a> of Philadelphia, particularly by Mother M. Katherine Drexel, the foundress of the <a href="02599a.htm">Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</a> for Indians and Coloured People. In 1883 the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission boarding <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> numbered eighteen and received from government allotments $39,175. The highwater mark in the number of <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> (forty-three boarding and seventeen day) was reached in 1890 and of Government compensation ($397, 756) in 1892.</p>

<p>The remarkable success of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> aroused great opposition, <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> suddenly changed their policy and declined to accept Government help for their mission <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, popular sentiment unfavorable to the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the contract <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> system was created by the <a href="01426a.htm">American Protective Association</a>, with the result that Congress in 1895 began to curtail its appropriations for <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in mission <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and in 1896 declared it "to be the settled policy of the Government to hereafter make no appropriation for education in any sectarian school", and in 1900 made what it designated "the final appropriation for sectarian <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>". During the term of the contract system, the Bureau secured from the Government for the tuition and support of children in Indian mission <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> the grand total of $4,540,263. Since the discontinuance of the contracts, some <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> have been closed; on the other hand new missions and new <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> have been established. Most of the existing <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> have been supported by the Bureau, which also aids in maintaining the missions and in providing <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the work of instructing <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian pupils of Government <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. At present, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> work, inclusive of <a href="01246b.htm">Alaska</a>, comprises fifty-three boarding and seven day <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The bureau provides support to forty-one of these boarding <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, besides providing for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of a number of Indian boys in an institution for whites. In 1907 it disbursed to the missions and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> $231, 517.31. This may be taken as an annual average of its work in this line.</p>

<p>The most important achievements of the Bureau within the last decade have been: (1) the revocation of the "Browning ruling" (1902) which denied the Indian parent the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to choose a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for his child, the Indian Office arrogating that right to itself; (2) the restoration of rations (1906), amounting approximately to $20,000, to pupils of mission <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> entitled to them by right of treaty, the rations having been denied the mission <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> children in 1901; (3) the securing of contracts, which produce to the contract <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> an average yearly income of $100,000 for the support and tuition of Indian pupils in certain mission <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, payable out of Indian tribal funds, these contracts being granted by order of President Roosevelt (1904), and sustained by a decision of the Supreme Court of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, 18 May, 1908, in consequence of which the tuition and support of the pupils of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of the Menominees (Wisconsin), <a href="14017a.htm">Sioux</a> (<a href="14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>), Northern Cheyennes (Montana), Osages and Quapaws (Oklahoma), which tribes have tribal funds, are paid out of the moneys of these tribes; (4) the recognition of the right of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian pupils in Government <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> to be exempted from attending <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> worship and instruction; (5) the securing of the enactment by Congress (1909) of a law granting patents in fee simple for the mission and <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> lands on Indian reservations (aggregating over 10,000 acres) which have been held by the church as tenant at will.</p>

<p>Of the annual amount disbursed by the Bureau, Mother Katherine Drexel contributes more than half. In this way from 1898 to 1908 she expended $799,157.37. Prior to 1891 no part of the annual <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> collection was granted the bureau for its <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> work. Since that time it has received from the collection and disbursed to the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> $276,286,74. The remainder of the funds disbursed by the Bureau have been accumulated by means of an appeal which it issues annually, and by donations, bequests, and <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> instituted for the soliciting of <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> for the Indian missions.</p>

<h2>Societies</h2>

<p>(1) The Catholic Indian Missionary Association (<a href="07789a.htm">indults</a> granted 16 July, 1876 and 20 July, 1876), for the support of the Bureau and its work, was organized (1875) in the city of Washington chiefly through the efforts of Mrs. Gen. Wm. T. Sherman. This association accomplished its purpose. The contract school system rendered it unnecessary and it ceased to exist.</p>

<p>(2) Society for the Preservation of the Faith Among Indian Children (<a href="07789a.htm">indult</a> granted 20 December, 1904), known as the Preservation Society, established by the Bureau in 1901, approved by the American <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and commended by <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (1908), collects from each of its members an annual fee of twenty-five cents for the benefit of the missions. It has maintained an average membership of from forty-five to fifty thousand. Recently the Most Reverend Incorporators of the Bureau have requested the American Federation of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Schools to take a special interest in this <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> and to secure and maintain for it a membership of eight hundred thousand. The director of the Bureau is the President of the Preservation Society.</p>

<p>(3) The <a href="09691a.htm">Marquette League</a>, an auxiliary to the Preservation Society (blessing bestowed by <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, July, 1904) was organized in New York City (1904) chiefly through the agency of Rev. H. G. Ganss, who for several years devoted his time to promoting the Preservation Society. The League exacts a membership fee of two dollars yearly and secures offerings for the repair and building of <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, the support of catechists, scholarships for Indian pupils in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions, and other missionary purposes. Its funds are distributed through the Bureau. Branches of the League have been established in various eastern centres, but the New York City League, under the able management of its successive presidents, Mr. E. Eyre, Mr. Joseph H. Fargis, Hon. Eugene A. Philbin, and the Brooklyn League, under its President, Mr. Alexander McKinney, have produced the best results.</p>

<h2>Benefactors</h2>

<p>Mother M. Katherine Drexel has been the most generous helper of the Bureau and the Indian missions. In the Indian and <a href="12627a.htm">Negro</a> mission work of the American church she holds a unique position. Other notable benefactors are: Cardinal Gibbons, <a href="04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>, Archbishop Ryan, Archbishop Farley, Archbishop Keane, Bishop Horstmann, Rev. T. K. Crowley, Rev. N Kirsten, Mrs. Edward Morrel, Henry Heide, Theodore E. Tack, <a href="09505a.htm">Thomas McMahon</a>, E. Eyre, F. S. Horn, John J. Horn, Robert A. Johnston, John G. Kuhrie, Miss Juliana Klein, Michael Fogarty, Association of the Holy Childhood, Ludwig-Missions-Verein (Munich).</p>

<h2>Bureau publications</h2>

<p>From 1877 to 1881 the Bureau published "Annals of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Missions in America". In 1883 it published a pamphlet, "The Work of the Decade"; in 1895, a pamphlet, "The Bureau of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Missions, 1874 to 1895". From time to time is has circulated statistics and various pamphlets on topics relating to Indian <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and mission work. It publishes each year a Report of the Director to the Most Reverend Incorporators, and an annual, "The Indian Sentinel" (since 1902), in the interest of the Preservation Society.
