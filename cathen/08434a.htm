<p><a href="01582a.htm">Antipope</a> of the Pisan party (1400-15), b. about 1370; d. 22 November, 1419. Cardinal Baldassare Cossa was one of the seven <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who, in May, 1408, deserted <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, and, with those belonging to the obedience of <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (see <a href="09431c.htm">P<font size=-2>EDRO DE</font> L<font size=-2>UNA</font></a>), convened the <a href="12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a>, of which Cossa became the leader.</p>

<p>Descended from a noble but impoverished <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, he embraced in his youth a military career, but later forsook it for the service of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Endowed with great energy and very talented, he studied <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> at Bologna, where he took his doctor's degree, and then entered the service of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> curia. On 27 February, 1402, <a href="02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> made him <a href="03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of St. Eustachius, and in the following year appointed him <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> of Romandiola. On 17 March, 1403, he set out for Bologna, where, until 1408, he proved himself an astute financial administrator of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> territory, as well as a skilful statesman and able commander. At the same time he was utterly worldly-minded, ambitious, crafty, unscrupulous, and immoral, a good soldier but no churchman. He played an important part in the <a href="12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> (1409), and, when the two <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> of <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, were deposed, he conducted the election of Pietro Philarghi, who was elevate to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> as <a href="01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>. The new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was entirely under the influence of Baldassare Cossa. The latter supported Louis of Anjou in a military expedition against Ladislaus of Naples. Louis seized on several fortresses in the Ecclesiastical States, and in 1400 captured <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> was now proclaimed <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but refused to leave Bologna, where he died on 3 May, 1410. In the hope of procuring an understanding with that <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="09566a.htm">Prince Malatesta</a> of <a href="13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, protector of <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, begged the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the Pisan obedience to defer a new election. These <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> assembled at Bologna would not consent, but, supported by Louis of Anjou and the city of Florence, elected Baldassare Cossa, 17 May, 1410. On 24 May Cossa was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, and on the following day was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, taking the name of John XXIII.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Soon after he ascended the throne, John received an ambassador from Sigismund of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, who wished to confer with him about the political and religious affairs of his kingdom. On 18 May King Ruprecht of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the firm supporter of <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, died. The electors of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and Cologne wrote informing John that they intended to elect Sigismund, King of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, as King of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. As Sigismund had, even before he heard of Ruprecht's death, entered into negotiations with the Pisan <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, John exerted himself all the more readily on his behalf, and on 21 July Sigismund, who had become reconciled with his brother Wenzel of Behemia, was chosen King of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Sigismund's election was also recognized by <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>. In April, 1411, John XXIII advanced with Louis of Anjou upon <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where they vigorously prosecuted the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against Ladislaus of Naples, and completely routed him at the battle of Roccasecca (19 May, 1411), but made no use of their victory. Soon afterwards, Louis of Anjou returned to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, thus enabling Ladislaus to rally his troops and strengthen his positions. Subsequently, John began negotiations with Ladislaus in spite of the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of 11 August, 1411. Ladislaus thereupon abandoned the cause of <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory</a>, and acknowledged John as legitimate <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, in recognition of which the latter withdrew his <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, enfeoffed Ladislaus with the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, consented to his conquest of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, appointed him <em>gonfalonier</em>, or standard-bearer, of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and gave him financial aid (16 October, 1412).</p>

<p>In conformity with a resolution passed at the <a href="12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a>, John had summoned a new council to meet at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 29 April, 1412, for the purpose of carrying out <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms. He also appointed a number of new <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, among whom were many able men, such as Francesco Zarabella of Florence, Pierre d'Ailly, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, Guillaume Fillastre, dean of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and Robert Hallam, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>. From the beginning of 1412 conferences and meetings of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> had been held throughout <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in preparation for this council, among the representatives appointed by the king being Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly and <a href="13799a.htm">Patriarch Cramaud</a>, created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1413. But, when the council was opened in April, there were so very few participants that it had to be prorogued several times. When the sessions finally began, the only thing accomplished was the condemnation of the writings of <a href="15722a.htm">Wycliff</a>, the council being dissolved in March, 1413. John's regrettable weakness in dealing with Ladislaus of Naples soon led to another attack by the latter upon <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> territory. In May, 1413, he invaded the Roman province, and John was compelled to fly with his <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. He escaped to <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where he sought the protection of Sigismund, King of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, then labouring in Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> for the convocation of a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> to put an end to the unfortunate <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. John's <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> were authorized to come to an understanding with Sigismund on this matter, and Sigismund took advantage of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> predicament to insist on the selection of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> as the meeting-place of the council. On 30 October, 1413, Sigismund invited Popes <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> and <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> and all <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> to attend, and prevailed on John XXIII, with whom he had a meeting at <a href="09322b.htm">Lodi</a> towards the end of November, to issue the Convocation <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> (9 December, 1413) of the general council to be opened at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> on 1 November, 1414.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>By the sudden death of Ladislaus (6 August, 1414) John's position in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was improved, and he could now return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> urgently protested that his presence was needed at the <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, and that he must adhere to his promise of presiding in person, and direct there the treatment of all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. On 1 October, 1414, John set out for <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> with a large following and supplied with ample means, but with heavy heart and anxious forebodings. Timidity and suspicion had replaced the warlike spirit he had shown as <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. On his way through the Tyrol he formed an alliance with Frederick of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who was on terms of enmity with Sigismund. John and his nine <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> made their entry into <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> on 29 October, 1414, and on 5 November the council was opened. The prospects of the Pisan <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> became daily more hopeless. The emperor had not bound himself by any permanent <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> towards John. He had needed this <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, as possessing ;the largest obedience, to bring about the council, but, from the summer of 1413, he had come to the conclusion that unity could be promoted only by the abdication or the deposal of all three claimants of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. John at first dominated the council, while he endeavoured to increase his adherents by presents, and, by the aid of spies, to learn the temper of the members. However, the hostility of the council towards him became ever more apparent. The chief spokesmen among his <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were Pierre d'Ailly and Fillastre; after Sigismund's arrival even these plainly expressed their opinion that the only way to put an end to the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> was by the abdication of all three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>.</p>

<p>In the second session of the council, John was persuaded to read aloud a formal promise of <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> abdication of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> (2 March, 1415), and to repeat this promise in a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 8 March. But on 20 March he fled secretly from <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> to Schaffhausen in the territory of Duke Frederick of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and thence to Freiburg im Breisgau, which belonged to the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, also his adherent. John's flight, in consequence of the great difficulties it caused the council, only increased the hostility towards him, and, while he himself tried to negotiate further concerning his abdication, his supporters were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to submit to Sigismund. Formally deposed in the twelfth session (29 May, 1415), John made his submission and commended himself to the mercy of the council. John was accused of the gravest offences in several inimical writings as well as in the formal charges of the council. Undeniably secular and ambitious, his moral life was not above reproach, and his unscrupulous methods in no wise accorded with the requirements of his high office. On the other hand, the heinous crimes of which his opponents in the council accused him were certainly gravely exaggerated. After his abdication he was again known as Baldassare Cossa, and was given into the custody of the Palatine Louis, who had always been his enemy. The latter kept him confined in different places (Rudolfzell, Gottlieben, Heidelberg, and Mannheim). At the forty-second session of the council, 28 Dec., 1417, after <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> had been elected, the release of Cossa was decreed. It was not, however, till the following year that he recovered his liberty. He then set out for Florence, where <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> was staying, and did homage to him as the Head of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. On 23 June, 1419, the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> made him <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Tusculum. But Cossa was completely crushed, and died a few months later at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where he was buried in the <a href="02276b.htm">baptistery</a> beside the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Cosimo de Medici erected a magnificent <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> to his memory.</p>
