<h2 id="section1">St. Ignatius Loyola</h2>

<p>(19 April 1541-31 July, 1556). The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> spread rapidly, and at the time of <a href="07639c.htm">St. Ignatius'</a> death had twelve provinces: <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a>, <a href="01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, Upper Germany, Lower <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> (including <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a>), <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, and <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, the last-mentioned province lasting but a short time. It met with opposition at the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>; while in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> it was severely attacked by Melchior Cano.</p>

<h2 id="section2">James Lainez</h2>

<p>(2 July, 1558-19 January, 1565). Lainez served two years as <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and was chosen general in the first general congregation, retarded until 1558 (19 June-10 Sept.) owing to the unfortunate <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> and Philip II. <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> gave orders that the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> should be recited in choir, and also that the generalate should only last three years. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> died on 18 August, 1559, and his orders were not renewed by his successor, <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>; indeed he refused Fr. Lainez leave to resign when his first triennium closed. Through <a href="12129a.htm">Pius'</a> nephew, <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> now received many privileges and openings, and progress was rapid. Father Lainez himself was sent to the "Colloquy of Poissy", and to the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1563-4), <a href="06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a> being left in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as his <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. At the death of Lainez the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> numbered 3500 members in 18 provinces and 130 houses.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section3">St. Francis Borgia</h2>

<p>(2 July 1565-1 October, 1572). One of the most delicate tasks of his government was to negotiate with <a href="12130a.htm">Pope St. Pius V</a>, who desired to reintroduce the singing of Office. This was in fact begun in May, 1569, but only in professed houses, and it was not to interfere with other work. <a href="12130a.htm">Pius</a> also <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> (Christmas, 1566) that no candidate for any <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> should be <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> until after his profession; and this indirectly caused much trouble to the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, with its distinct grades of professed and non-professed <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. All therefore had to be professed of three <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, until <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> (December, 1572) allowed the original practice to be restored. Under his administration the foreign missionary work of the order greatly increased and prospered. New missions were opened by the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> in <a href="06115b.htm">Florida</a>, Mexico, and <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Everard Mercurian</h2>

<p><a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> (23 April, 1573-1 August 1580). Fr. Mercurian was born in 1514 in the village of Marcour (Luxembourg), whence his name, which he signed Everard de Marcour. He became the first non-Spanish general of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. <a href="07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a>, without commanding, had expressed his desire for this change. This, however, caused great dissatisfaction and opposition among a number of the Spanish and Portuguese members, which came to a crisis during the generalate of Father Mercurian's successor, Father Claudius Acquaviva. Father Tolet was entrusted with the task of obtaining the submission of <a href="02209c.htm">Michael Baius</a> to the decision of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; he succeeded, but his success later served to draw on the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> the <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. Father Mercurian, when general, brought the rules to their final form, compiling the "Summary of the Constitutions" from the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of St. Ignatius, and drawing up the "Common Rules" of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, and the particular rules of each office. He was greatly interested in the foreign missions and established the Marionite and English missions, and sent to the latter <a href="05293c.htm">Blessed Edmund Campion</a> and <a href="11729a.htm">Father Robert Persons</a>. Father Everard Mercurian passed thirty-two years in the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, and died at the age of sixty-six. At that time the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> numbered 5000 members in eighteen provinces.</p>

<h2 id="section5">Claudius Acquaviva (Aquaviva)</h2>

<p>Neapolitan (19 February, 1581-31 January, 1615). (For the disputations on grace, see <a href="04238a.htm">Congregatio de Auxiliis</a>). After Ignatius, Acquaviva was perhaps the ablest ruler of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. As a legislator he reduced to its present form the final parts of the Institute, and the <a href="12654a.htm">Ratio Studiorum</a>. He had also to contend with extraordinary obstacles both from without and within. The <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> was banished from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and from <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>; there were grave differences with the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, with <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, with the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>; and within the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> the rivalry between <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and Italian led to unusual complications and to the calling of two extraordinary general congregations (fifth and sixth). The origin of these troubles is perhaps eventually to be sought in the long <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion, which gradually died down after the canonical <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>, 1595 (in which Fathers Georges, Toledo, and <a href="12317a.htm">Possevinus</a> played important parts). The fifth congregation in 1593 supported Acquaviva steadily against the opposing parties, and the sixth, in 1608, completed the union of opinions. <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a> in 1606 re-confirmed the Institute, which from now onwards may be considered to have won a stable position in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at large, until the epoch of the Suppression and the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. Missions were established in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="03660a.htm">Chile</a>, <a href="11470b.htm">Paraguay</a>, the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, and <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>. At Father Acquaviva's death the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> numbered 13,112 members in 32 provinces and 559 houses.</p>

<h2 id="section6">Mutius Vitelleschi</h2>

<p>Roman (15 November, 1615-9 February, 1645). His generalate was one of the most pacific and progressive, especially in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>; but the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> worked havoc in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Sts. Ignatius and <a href="06233b.htm">Francis Xavier</a> (1622) and the first centenary of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> (1640) were celebrated with great rejoicings. The great mission of <a href="11470b.htm">Paraguay</a> began, that of <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> was stamped out in blood. <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> was raised in 1619 to the rank of a province of the order, having been a mission until then. Missions were established in Tibet (1624), Tonkin (1627), and Maranhao (1640). (See <a href="15486d.htm">VITELLESCHI</a>)</p>



<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section7">Vincent Caraffa</h2>

<p>Neapolitan (7 January 1646-8 June 1649). A few days before Father Caraffa's election as general, <a href="08020b.htm">Pope Innocent X</a> published a brief "Prospero felicique statui", in which he ordered a general congregation of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> to be held every nine years; it was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> also that no office in the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> except the position of master of <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a> should be held for more than three years. The latter regulation was revoked by <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent's</a> successor, <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> on 1 January, 1658; and the former by <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1746 by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Devotam", many <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> having been granted in the mean time.</p>

<h2 id="section8">Francis Piccolomini of Sienna</h2>

<p>(21 December, 1649-17 June, 1651). Before his election as general he had been professor of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the Roman college; he died at the age of sixty-nine, having passed fifty-three years in the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section9">Aloysius Gottifredi</h2>

<p>Roman (21 January, 1652-12 March 1652). Father Gottifredi died at the house of the professed Fathers, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, within two months after his election, and before the Fathers assembled for the election and congregation had concluded their labour. He had been a professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> at the Roman College, and later secretary of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> under <a href="15486d.htm">Father Mutius Vitelleschi</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section10">Goschwin Nickel</h2>

<p>German (b. at J&uuml;lich in 1582; 17 March, 1652-31 July, 1664). During these years the struggle with <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> was growing more and more heated. The great controversy on the Chinese Rites (1645) was continued (see <a href="13034a.htm">MATTEO RICCI</a>). Owing to his great age, Father Nickel obtained from the eleventh congregation the appointment of John Paul Oliva as <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (on 7 June, 1661), with the approval of <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section11">John Paul Oliva</h2>

<p>Genoese (elected vicar cum jure successionis on 7 June, 1661) 31 July, 1664-26 November 1681. During his generalate, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> established a mission in <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>, which at first met with great success, four hundred thousand converts being made within twenty-five years; in 1736, however, the mission was destroyed by violent <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Father Oliva's generalate occurred during one of the most difficult periods in the history of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, as the controversy on <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, the <em>droit de r&eacute;gale</em>, and <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a> were being carried on by the opponents of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> with the greatest acrimony and <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a>. Father John Paul Oliva laboured earnestly to keep up the <a href="14081a.htm">Society's</a> high reputation for learning, and in a circular letter sent to all the houses of study urged the cultivation of the oriental languages.</p>

<h2 id="section12">Charles de Noyelle</h2>

<p>Belgian, 5 July 1682-12 December, 1868. Father de Noyelle was born at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a> on 28 July, 1615; so great was his <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a> for virtue and <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> that at his election he received unanimous vote of the congregation. He had been assistant for the Germanic provinces for more than 20 years; he died at the age of seventy, after fifty years spent in the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. Just about the time of his election, the dispute between <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV of France</a> and <a href="08021a.htm">Pope Innocent XI</a> had culminated in the publication of the "D&eacute;claration du clerg&eacute;de France" (19 March, 1682). This placed the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> in a difficult position in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, as its spirit of devotion to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> was not in harmony with the spirit of the "D&eacute;claration". It required all the ingenuity and ability of Pere La Chaise and Father de Noyelle to avert a disaster. <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> was dissatisfied with the position the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> adopted, and threatened to suppress the order, proceeding even so far as to forbid the reception of <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section13">Thyrsus Gonz&aacute;lez</h2>

<p>Spaniard, 6 July, 1687-27 October, 1705. He interfered in the controversy between <a href="12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> and Probabiliorism, attacking the former <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> with energy in a book published at Dilligen in 1691. As <a href="12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> was on the whole in favour in the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, this caused discussions which were not quieted until the fourteenth congregation, 1696, when, with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> approval, liberty was left to both sides. Father Gonzalez in his earlier days had laboured with great fruit as a missionary, and after his election as general encouraged the work of popular home missions. His treatise "De infallibitate Romani pontificis in definiendis fidei et morum controversiis" which was a vigorous attack on the doctrines laid down in the "D&eacute;claration du clerg&eacute;de France" was published at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1689 by order of <a href="08021a.htm">Pope Innocent XI</a>; however, <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent's</a> successor, <a href="01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a>, caused the work to be withdrawn, as its effects had been to render the relations between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> more difficult. Father Gonz&aacute;lez* laboured earnestly to spread <a href="12275b.htm">devotion</a> to the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>; he died at the age of eighty-four, having passed sixty-three years in the order, during nineteen of which he was general.</p>

<h2 id="section14">Michelangelo Tamburini</h2>

<p>Of <a href="10413a.htm">Modena</a>, 31 January, 1706-28 February, 1730. The long reign of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, so favorable to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in many respects, saw the beginning of those hostile movements which were to lead to the Suppression. The king's autocratic powers, his Gallicanism, his insistence on the repression of the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> by <a href="15446a.htm">force</a>, the way he compelled the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> to take his part in the quarrel with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> about the <em>r&eacute;gale</em> (1684-8), led to a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> situation in which the parts might be reversed, when the all-powerful sovereign might turn against them, or by standing neutral leave them the prey of others. This was seen at his death, 1715, when the regent banished the once influential father confessor Le Tellier, while the gallicanizing <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a>, laid them under an <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> (1716-29). <a href="14440d.htm">Father Tamburini</a> who before his election as general had taught <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for twelve years and had been chosen by Cardinal Renauld d'Este as his <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>; he had also been <a href="12514b.htm">provincial</a> of <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, secretary-general of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, and <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. During the disputes concerning the Chinese Rites, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> was accused of resisting the orders of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Father Tamborini protested energetically against this <a href="03190c.htm">calumny</a>, and when in 1711 the procurators of all the provinces of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> were assembled in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he had them sign a protest which he dedicated to <a href="04029a.htm">Pope Clement XI</a>. The destruction of Port Royal and the condemnation of the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> (1711) testified to the accuracy of the opinions adopted by the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> in these disputes. <a href="14440d.htm">Father Tamburini</a> procured the <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Saints <a href="01331c.htm">Aloysius Gonzaga</a> and Stanislaus Kostka, and the beatification of St. John Francis R&eacute;gis. During his generalate the mission of <a href="11470b.htm">Paraguay</a> reached its highest degree of success; in one year no fewer than 77 missionaries left for it; the missionary labors of <a href="06218b.htm">St. Francis de Geronimo</a> and Blessed Anthony Baldinucci in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Venerable Manuel Padial in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, enhanced the reputation of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. <a href="14440d.htm">Father Tamburini</a> died at the age of 82, having spent sixty-five years in religion. At the time of his death, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> contained 37 provinces, 24 houses of professed Fathers, 612 colleges, 59 novitiates, 340 residences, 200 mission stations; in addition, one hundred and fifty-seven <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were directed by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section15">Francis Retz</h2>

<p><a href="02121b.htm">Austrian</a> (born at Prague in 1673) 7 March, 1730-19 November 1750. Father Retz was elected general unanimously, his able administration contributed much to the welfare of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>; he obtained the <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="08464a.htm">St. John Francis Regis</a>. Father Retz's generalate was perhaps the quietest in the history of the order. At the time of his death, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> contained 39 provinces, 24 houses of professed Fathers, 669 colleges, 61 novitiates, 335 residences, 273 mission stations 176 <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and 22,589 members of whom 11,293 were <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section16">Ignatius Viscanti</h2>

<p>Milanese, 4 July, 1751-4 May 1755. It was during this generalate that the accusations of trading were first made against Father Antonine de La Valette, who was recalled from <a href="09731a.htm">Martinique</a> in 1753 to justify his conduct. Shortly before dying, Fr. Viscanti allowed him to return to his mission, where the failure of his commercial operations, somewhat later, gave an opportunity to the enemies of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to begin a <a href="15546c.htm">warfare</a> that ended only with the Suppression (see below). Trouble with <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal</a> also began at this time. Father Visconti died at the age of seventy-three.</p>

<h2 id="section17">Aloysius Centurioni</h2>

<p>Genoese, 30 November, 1755-2 October 1757. During his brief generalate, the most noteworthy facts were the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> by <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal</a> of the Portuguese <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the troubles caused by Father de La Valette's commercial activities and disasters. Father Centurioni died at Castel Gandolfo, at the age of seventy-two.</p>

<h2 id="section18">Lorenzo Ricci</h2>

<p>Florentine, 21 May, 1758 until the Suppression in 1773. In 1759, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> contained 41 provinces, 270 mission posts, and 171 <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. <a href="13033a.htm">Father Ricci</a> founded the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> province of the order in 1770. His generalate saw the slow death agony of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>; within two years the Portuguese, <a href="02745c.htm">Brazilian</a> and East Indian provinces and missions were destroyed by <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal</a>; close to two thousand members of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> were cast destitute on the shores of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in fetid dungeons in <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the two Sicilies followed in the footsteps of <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal</a>. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Apostolicum" of <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> in favor of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> produced no fruit. <a href="04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> at last yielded to the demand for the extinction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. <a href="13033a.htm">Father Ricci</a> was seized, and cast a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> into the Castel San Angelo, were he was treated as a criminal until death ended his sufferings on 24 November, 1775. In 1770, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> contained 42 provinces, 24 houses of professed Fathers, 669 colleges, 61 novitiates, 335 residences, 273 mission stations, and about 23,000 members.</p>
