<p>(VLADIMIR or VOLODOMIR).</p>

<p>Grand Duke of Kieff and All <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, grandson of St. Olga, and the first Russian ruler to embrace <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, b. 956; d. at Berestova, 15 July, 1015. St. Olga could not convert her son and successor, Sviatoslav, for he lived and died a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and brought up his son Vladimir as a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> chieftain. Sviatoslav had two legitimate sons, Yaropolk and Oleg, and a third son, Vladimir, borne him by his court favourite Olga Malusha. Shortly before his death (972) he bestowed the Grand Duchy of Kieff on Yaropolk and gave the land of the Drevlani (now Galicia) to Oleg. The ancient Russian capital of Novgorod threatened rebellion and, as both the princes refused to go thither, Sviatoslav bestowed its sovereignty upon the young Vladimir. Meanwhile <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> broke out between Yaropolk and Oleg, and the former conquered the Drevlanian territory and dethroned Oleg. When this news reached Vladimir he feared a like fate and fled to the Varangians (Variags) of Scandinavia for help, while Yaropolk conquered Novgorod and united all <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> under his sceptre. A few years later Vladimir returned with a large force and retook Novgorod. Becoming bolder he waged <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against his brother towards the south, took the city of Polotzk, slew its prince, Ragvald, and married his daughter Ragnilda, the <a href="02537c.htm">affianced</a> bride of Yaropolk. Then he pressed on and besieged Kieff. Yaropolk fled to Rodno, but could not hold out there, and was finally slain upon his surrender to the victorious Vladimir; the latter thereupon made himself ruler of Kieff and all <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 980. As a <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> prince Vladimir had four wives besides Ragnilda, and by them had ten sons and two daughters. Since the days of St. Olga, <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which was originally established among the eastern <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a> by Sts. Cyril and Methodius, had been making secret progress throughout the land of Russ (now eastern <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>) and had begun to considerably alter the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. It was a period similar to the era of the conversion of Constantine.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Notwithstanding this undercurrent of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, Vladimir erected in Kieff many <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> and shrines (<em>trebishcha</em>) to the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavic</a> <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> gods, Perun, Dazhdbog, Simorgl, Mokosh, Stribog, and others. In 981 he subdued the Chervensk cities (now Galicia), in 983 he overcame the wild Yatviags on the shores of the Baltic Sea, in 985 he fought with the <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> on the lower Volga, and in 987 he planned a campaign against the Greco-Roman Empire, in the course of which he became interested in <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The Chronicle of Nestor relates that he sent envoys to the neighbouring countries for information concerning their <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a>. The envoys reported adversely regarding the <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> who followed (<a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a>), the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> of Khazar, and the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> with their plain missionary Latin churches, but they were delighted with the solemn Greek ritual of the Great Church (St. Sophia) of Constantinople, and reminded Vladimir that his grandmother Olga had embraced that Faith. The next year (988) he besieged Kherson in the Crimea, a city within the borders of the eastern Roman Empire, and finally took it by cutting off its water supply. He then sent envoys to Emperor Basil II at Constantinople to ask for his sister Anna in marriage, adding a threat to march on Constantinople in case of refusal. The emperor replied that a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> might not marry a <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a>, but if Vladimir were a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> prince he would sanction the alliance. To this Vladimir replied that he had already examined the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrines of the Christians</a>, was inclined towards them, and was ready to be <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Basil II sent this sister with a retinue of officials and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to Kherson, and there Vladimir was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, in the same year, by the Metropolitan Michael and took also the <a href="10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> of Basil. A current legend relates that Vladimir had been stricken with blindness before the arrival of Anna and her retinue and had recovered his sight upon being <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>. He then married Princess Anna, and thereafter put away his <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> wives. He surrendered the city of Kherson to the Greeks and returned to Kieff in state with his bride. The Russian historian Karamsin (Vol. I, p. 215) suggests that Vladimir could have been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> long before at Kieff, since <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and their <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were already there; but such an act would have humbled the proud chieftain in the eyes of his people, for he would have accepted in a lowly manner an inconspicuous rite at the hands of a secret and despised <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. Hence he preferred to have it come from the envoys of the Roman Emperor of Constantinople, as a means of impressing his people.</p>

<p>When Vladimir returned to Kieff he took upon himself the conversion of his subjects. He ordered the <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of the gods to be thrown down, chopped to pieces, and some of them burned; the chief god, Perun, was dragged through the mud and thrown into the River Dnieper. These acts impressed the people with the helplessness of their gods, and when they were told that they should follow Vladimir's example and become <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> they were willingly <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, even wading into the river that they might the sooner be reached by the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Zubrycki thinks this readiness shows that the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrines of Christianity</a> had already been secretly spread in Kieff and that the people only waited for an opportunity to publicly acknowledge them. Vladimir urged all his subjects to become <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, established churches and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> not only at Kieff, but at Pereyaslav, Chernigoff, Bielegorod, Vladimir in Volhynia, and many other cities. In 989 he erected the large Church of St. Mary ever Virgin (usually called <em>Desiatinny Sobor</em>, the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of the Tithes), and in 996 the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Transfiguration, both in the city of Kieff. He gave up his warlike career and devoted himself principally to the government of his people; he established <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, introduced <a href="04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>, and became known for his mildness and for his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> in spreading the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>. His wife died in 1011, having borne him two sons, Boris and Glib (also known as Sts. Roman and David, from their <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> names). After this his life became troubled by the conduct of his elder children. Following the custom of his ancestors, he had parcelled out his kingdom amongst his children, giving the city of Novgorod in fief to his eldest son Yaroslav; the latter rebelled against him and refused to render either service or tribute. In 1014 Vladimir prepared to march north to Novgorod and take it away from his disobedient son, while Yaroslav invoked the help of the Varangians against his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>. Vladimir fell ill and died on the way. His feast in celebrated on 15 July in the Russian Orthodox and <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03158a.htm">calendars</a>, and he has received the name of <em>Ravnoapostol</em> (equal to the Apostles) in the title of the feast and the troparion of the liturgy. The <a href="13231c.htm">Russians</a> have added in their service books words referring his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> and intercession to the present Russian Empire (<em>rossiiskaya zemlya</em>), but the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> have never permitted these interpolations.</p>
