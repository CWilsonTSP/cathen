<p>An Order founded at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, by Nano (Honoria) Nagle (see below). In 1775 she entered with some companions on a <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>. With them she received the habit 29 June, 1776, taking the name of Mother Mary of St. John of God. They made their first annual <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> 24 June, 1777. The foundress had begun the erection of a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> close to that which she had built for the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and it was opened on <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 1777. They adopted as their title "Sisters of the Sacred Heart", which was changed in 1791 to that of "Presentation Sisters". Their habit was similar to that of the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. The second superioress was Mother Mary Angela Collins. Soon after her succession a set of rules, adapted from <a href="02079b.htm">that of St. Augustine</a>, was drawn up by <a href="10609b.htm">Bishop Moylan</a>, and approved by <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> in Sept., 1791. This congregation of teaching sisters was raised to the status of a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order by <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in 1800.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Communities from <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a> were founded at Killarney in 1793; Dublin in 1794; and at Waterford in 1798. A second <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a> was established in 1799, by Sister M. Patrick Fitzgerald; and a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at Kilkenny in 1800, by Sister M. Joseph McLoughlan. At the present day, there are 62 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, and about 1500 sisters. Each community is independent of the mother-house, and subject only to its own superioress and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of its respective diocese. The <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, under the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> Government Board, have for their first object the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and moral training of the young, which is not interfered with by the Government. The secular system followed is the "National", superseded, in many cases, by the "Intermediate", both of which ensure a sound <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>; to which are added domestic economy, Latin, <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>, French, and German. The average attendance of children in each of the city <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, and Limerick is over 1200; that in the country <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> between 300 and 400, making a total of 22,200 who receive an excellent <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> gratis. For girls who are <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to earn a living, work-rooms have been established at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, Youghal, and other places, where Limerick lace, <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> points and crochet are taught. The first foreign country to receive a Presentation Convent was Newfoundland in 1829, when Sisters Josephine French and M. de Sales Lovelock went from <a href="06373a.htm">Galway</a>. There are now fourteen houses of the order on the island and about twenty in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the first of which was founded at <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> by Mother Xavier Cronin from Kilkenny in 1854.</p>

<p>In 1833 a house was founded by Mother Josephine Sargeant from Clonmel at <a href="09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, from which sprang two more, one at Buxton and one at Glossop. Their <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> are well attended; the number of children, including those of an <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, being about 1400. <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> received its first foundation in 1841, when Mother Xavier Kearney and some sisters from Rahan and Mullingar established themselves at <a href="09515a.htm">Madras</a>. Soon four more <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> in the presidency were founded from this, and in 1891 one at Rawal Pindi. Their <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> are flourishing, comprising <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and day and boarding-schools, both for <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a> and natives. At Rawal Pindi the sisters do much good work among the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> soldiers, who go to them for religious instruction. In 1866 Mother Xavier Murphy and some sisters left Fermoy for a first foundation at <a href="07380c.htm">Hobart</a> Town, Tasmania, under the auspices of its first <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Dr. Murphy. There is a branch of this house at Launceston. St. Kilda, <a href="10155a.htm">Melbourne</a>, received sisters from Kildare in 1873, and Wagga Wagga a year later, with Mother M. John Byrne at their head. From these two houses numerous others branched forth to all parts of <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a>; today there are over twenty <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, about 500 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and thousands of children attending their <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</p>

<h2>Presentation Order in America</h2>

<p>About half a century after its establishment, the Presentation Order sent four sisters from the <a href="06373a.htm">Galway</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> to <a href="10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, at the request of Dr. Fleming, <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the island. The mother-house is at St. John's; there are now (1911) thirteen <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, 120 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and over 2000 pupils. In November, 1854, some Presentation Nuns arrived at <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> from <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Mother M. Teresa Comerford and her sisters had great initial difficulties; but <a href="01282a.htm">Archbishop Alemany</a> succeeded in interesting prominent <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the city in their work, and in course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> two fine <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> were built within the city limits, besides <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> at Sonoma and Berkeley. The earthquake of 1906 destroyed both of their <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> in the city, with practically their entire contents; but the sisters have <a href="06147a.htm">courageously</a> begun their work afresh, and bid fair to accomplish as much good work as in the past.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The Presentation Convent, St. Michael's, <a href="11020a.htm">New York City</a>, was founded 8 Sept., 1874, by Mother Joseph Hickey, of the Presentation Convent, Terenure, Co. Dublin, with two sisters from that <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, two from Clondalkin, and seven <a href="12319b.htm">postulants</a>. Rev. Arthur J. Donnelly, <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Michael's Church, on completing his <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> building, went to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1873 to invite the Presentation Nuns to take charge of the girls' department. The consent of the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> having been obtained, <a href="04564a.htm">Cardinal Cullen</a> applied to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> authorizing the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> to leave <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and proceed to New York, which was accorded by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. The work of the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> at St. Michael's has been eminently successful. From 1874 to 1910 there have been entered on the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> register 16,781 names. In 1884 the sisters took charge of St. Michael's Home, Green Ridge, Staten Island, where over two hundred destitute children are cared for.</p>

<p>In 1886 Mother Magdalen Keating, with a few sisters, left New York at the invitation of Rev. P. J. Garrigan, afterwards <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14016a.htm">Sioux City</a>, and took charge of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of St. Bernard's Parish, Fitchburg, <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. The mission <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> most flourishing, and has branch houses in West Fitchburg and Clinton, <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>; Central Falls, Rhode Island; and Berlin, <a href="10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>. The order was introduced into the <a href="05179b.htm">Diocese of Dubuque</a> by Mother M. Vincent Hennessey in 1874. There are now branch-houses at Calmar, Elkader, Farley, Key West, Lawler, Waukon, Clare, Danbury, Whittemore, and Madison, Nebraska. The order came to <a href="05786a.htm">Fargo, North Dakota</a>, in 1880 under Mother Mary John Hughes, and possesses a free <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, home, and academy. St. Colman's, Watervliet, New York, was opened in 1881, the sisters having charge of the flourishing <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. In 1886 some sisters from <a href="05786a.htm">Fargo</a> went to <a href="01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>, and since then, under the guidance of Mother M. Joseph Butler, they have taken charge of <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> at Bridgewater, <a href="02790b.htm">Bristol</a>, Chamberlain, Elkton, Jefferson, Mitchell, Milbank, and Woonsocket, besides two <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. There are in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> 438 members of the order, who conduct 32 <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, attended by 6909 pupils; 5 academies, with 416 pupils; 3 <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, with 519 inmates; 2 <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>.</p>

<h2>Nano Nagle (Honoria)</h2>

<p>The foundress of the Presentation Order, born at Ballygriffin, <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1728; died at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, 20 April, 1784. After an elementary <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were then proscribed, she went to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> for further studies, where some of her kinsmen were living in the suite of the exiled King James, and entered on a brilliant social life in the court circles of the capital. One morning, when returning from a ball, she was struck by the sight of crowds of working-men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> waiting for a church to be opened for early Mass. A few weeks later she returned to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and only the stringent <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> then in force against <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> activity prevented her from consecrating herself at once to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> training of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> children, who were growing up in <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of their Faith. A short time spent as a <a href="12319b.htm">postulant</a> at a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> confirmed her <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> that her mission lay rather in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, a conviction strengthened by the advice of her directors. Her first step on returning to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was to familiarize herself with the work of some ladies who had privately organized a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and, on the death of her mother and sister, she went to <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, where in the face of the most adverse conditions she began her crusade against the <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and vice there prevalent. Her first pupils were gathered secretly, and her part in the undertaking having been discovered, it was only after a period of opposition that she secured the support of her relatives. In less than a year, however, she had established two <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and five for girls, with a capacity for about two hundred. The foundress herself conducted the classes in <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> and instructed those preparing for First Communion, searching the most abandoned parts of the city for those in need of spiritual and temporal help. Her charity extended also to aged and infirm <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, for whom she established an asylum at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, and especially to working-women, whose perseverance in <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and virtue was a source of solicitude to her. The demands of her numerous charitable undertakings proving excessive for her resources, she solicited contributions from house to house, at the cost of much humiliation.</p>

<p>For the purpose of perpetuating her work she decided to found a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>; and a community of <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, young Irishwomen trained especially for the purpose, was sent to <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a> in 1771, although they did not venture to assume their religious garb for eight years. As the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Rule, with which Nano had not thoroughly acquainted herself, did not permit entire <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> to the visitation of the sick and the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of poor children, she resolved to form a community more peculiarly adapted to the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> she had taken up, while remaining a devoted friend of the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. In 1775 she founded the Presentation Order (see above). She set an example of charity and self-abnegation to her community, giving seven hours daily to the class-room and four to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in addition to the demands of her <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> as superior and her work of visitation. It was said there was not a single garret in <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a> that she did not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>. Her austerities and the persistence with which she continued her labours in the most inclement weather brought on a fatal illness; she died exhorting her community to spend themselves for the poor. Her remains were <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> in the cemetery of the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> she had built.</p>
