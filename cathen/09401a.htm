<p>L&uuml;beck, a free imperial state and one of the Hanse towns, is in area the second smallest and in population the twentieth state in the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The state, which includes the city of L&uuml;beck and its neighbourhood, has an area of about 115 sq. m. and a population (1905) of 105,857 inhabitants, of whom 101,724 were <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, 2457 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 638 <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Of the three Hanse towns which still remain &mdash; Hamburg, <a href="02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, and L&uuml;beck &mdash; L&uuml;beck was the last founded. It was first established in the eleventh century, below the site of the present town, and in the midst of the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavic</a> tribes dwelling on the coast of the Baltic, and a church was erected there under the protection of Henry the Proud. This settlement, however, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> too weak to withstand the attack of the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, and was destroyed early in the twelfth century. In 1143 Count Adolf II of Holstein founded a new colony above the site of the former, at the junction of the Trave and the Wakenitz, and introduced settlers from <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, and Friesland. The rapid development of the town awakened at first the <a href="08326b.htm">envy</a> of Duke Henry the Lion, and he only began to favour it after its submission to him in 1157. He gave the town a municipal constitution, established a mint there, and made Bishop Gerold transfer to L&uuml;beck the seat of the Bishopric of Oldenburg, founded by <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a> for Wagria. In 1173 Henry himself laid the foundation-stone of the Romanesque <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was completed in 1210. To the east of the town the Johanneskloster was founded in 1177, and occupied by <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> from <a href="03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On the downfall of Henry, the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> became <a href="05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, while the town itself <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> submitted to <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, who, in 1188, confirmed its liberties and its territorial boundaries. The commerce of the town developed rapidly, and its ships traversed the whole Baltic Sea. This prosperity by no means diminished with the advent of the Danes, who, under Cnut VI, brought Holstein and L&uuml;beck into subjection in 1201. The victory of the Holsteiners over the Danes at Yornh&ouml;od, in 1227, restored to L&uuml;beck its complete independence. In 1226 it had been already raised by <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> to the rank of a free city of the empire, although the emperor had not availed himself of his authority to appoint a protector for its territories. Even the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who resided at first in the <em>area capituli</em> (the <em>Thum</em> or Domhof) --but after the middle of the thirteenth century in Eutin, while his chapter remained in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> area--had no secular <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the town, whose privileges were ratified by Popes <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> and <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>. What great prestige L&uuml;beck acquired throughout Northern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by its vigorous preservation of its independence, may be inferred from the fact that numerous North German towns adopted the municipal law of L&uuml;beck as the model for their own. The prominent position which L&uuml;beck held in Baltic commerce from the thirteenth century resulted naturally in her taking the leading part in the Hansa, or great confederacy of Low German cities, formed in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. As head of the Hansa, the importance of L&uuml;beck increased enormously in Northern <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, until finally it stood at the head of over 100 towns and cities which had adopted its <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>. At times, however, it had to bear the burden of defending the Hansa unassisted, especially against its hereditary foe, <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of 1362-70, L&uuml;beck captured Copenhagen (1368), and, by the Peace of Stralsund, was appointed arbitrator of the dispute concerning the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> Crown. The following decades constitute the era of L&uuml;beck's greatest prosperity. In 1372 its burgomaster was appointed by the emperor. Domestic strife between the patricians and the guilds broke out in L&uuml;beck as elsewhere, but resulted in its case in the maintenance of the rule of the merchant patricians, from whose <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> were chosen throughout the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the four burgomasters and the twenty councillors. The power of L&uuml;beck in the fifteenth century is shown by the emperor's request, in 1464, that it should arrange peace between the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> and the Poles, although the mission of the burgomaster, Castorp, was none too successful. He met with greater success in preventing his city from being drawn into the disputes of the neighbouring Scandinavian lands. In the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between Christian I of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Sweden (1499&mdash;), however, L&uuml;beck could not remain neutral; it afforded protection and shelter to the exiled Gustavus Vasa, formed the confederacy of the Wendish towns and Danzig against Christian, in 1521, asserted once more the might of the Hansa in the Baltic, and dispatched with Gustavus Vasa a fleet to blockade Stockholm in 1522. In 1523 Stockholm had to surrender to the L&uuml;beck admirals, and from their hands the newly elected King Vasa of Sweden received the keys of his capital.</p>

<p>The <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> found a later entrance into L&uuml;beck than into other North-German towns. The initiative in introducing the new <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was taken by the middle classes, while the municipal authorities, on account of their friendship for the emperor and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, strongly opposed the innovation. After 1529, however, in consequence of the pecuniary demands of the council, a citizens' committee of forty-eight members was formed to enquire into the finances of the town. This committee procured a petition of the citizens for the introduction of <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> preachers. On 5 June, 1530, pursuant to a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the citizens which the council could not oppose, <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> services were introduced into all the churches of L&uuml;beck except the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was under the territorial <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the chapter, and all <a href="04049b.htm">clergymen</a> were forbidden to celebrate <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> until further notice. In consequence of the supineness of the chapter, <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> services were held even in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in July, and it was only in the choir, and at certain hours that <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship was tolerated. The reigning <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Heinrich III Bockholt (1523-35), could offer no effective resistance to the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in the town, but he exerted himself to the utmost. After his death, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, desiring the friendship of the neighbouring <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes lest their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> should be confiscated, elected <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> views--Detlef von Reventlow (1535) and Daithasar von Rantzow (1536-47). These were succeeded by four <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Jodokus Hodfilter (1547-53), who, however, lived away from his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Theodorich von Reden, who resigned in 1555; Andreas von Barby (1557-79), who did not obtain <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation; and the determined <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Johann Tiedemann (d. 1561). Eberhard von Holle (1564-86) openly espoused <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in 1565, introduced the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> almost completely into the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and, in 1571, surrendered even the choir of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to the preachers.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>With the eleven-year-old Johann Adolf, who was the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to marry (1596), began the succession of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the House of Holstein-Gottorp, in whose possession this <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>--the only <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>--remained, even after the Peace of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, until the secularization of 1803. Most of the <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a> also fell into the hands of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>: on 1 Jan., 1624, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> still occupied 6 <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a>, 13 vicarships, and 4 <a href="12371a.htm">prebends</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; at the end of the seventeenth century they held only four <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a>. It was owing to the continued existence of a remnant of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> within the city that <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> did not utterly perish in L&uuml;beck. The care of the few <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there (in 1709, fourteen <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> with sixty members within the city and about forty outside) was entrusted to a missionary paid by the canons. This missionary was, as a rule, one of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who, from 1651, were permanently established within the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> domain, or area. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of L&uuml;beck repeatedly received imperial letters of protection in favour of the free practice of their religion. In 1683 the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were granted the right of holding service within the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <em>area</em> and administering the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and the right of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the city to attend these services and receive the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> was never afterwards disputed. Concerning the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to administer the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of Baptism and Matrimony, disputes afterwards arose, and for the periods 1705-14 and 1775-1805, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> did not dare to <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a> or marry in public. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> resided with the canons until 1702, when they founded a separate establishment in which they held <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship until 1773. On the suppression of their order, the fathers at first continued their pastoral <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, but other <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> succeeded them in course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>. It was the French domination, in 1811, which first brought an extension of religious freedom for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century the political importance of L&uuml;beck declined. The rash efforts of Burgomaster J&uuml;rgen Wullenweber (1533-35) to oust <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> trade from the Baltic, to revive L&uuml;beck's hegemony there, and, in union with Count Christopher of Oldenburg, to restore the exiled Christian II of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> to his throne, ended, after some initial successes, unfortunately, and led to the decay of Lubeck. Once more did it appear as an important political factor, when <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> broke out between <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Sweden in 1563, and L&uuml;beck sustained, in union with the former, a vigorous and successful naval conflict against Sweden. The Peace of Stettin, in 1570, guaranteed the town many of its claims, but the heavy cost of the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> had imposed such a burden on it that it was henceforth without the resources for carrying on <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>. With the diminution, through various causes, of the power and influence of the whole Hansa, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, that of L&uuml;beck also declined, especially as Hamburg and Bremen were now gradually outstripping it in commerce. The town finally sank into the position of a port of call between the transatlantic and northern commerce. The <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> imposed grievous burdens on the defenceless citizens in consequence of the repeated quartering of soldiers in the town. When, after its last diets in 1630 and 1669, the Hansa was finally dissolved and there was formed a defensive alliance-- L&uuml;beck, <a href="07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, and Bremen, the Council of L&uuml;beck still retained the directorship as the sole remnant of its former position of eminence.</p>

<p>During the long period of peace, following the confusion of the Northern War which crippled Baltic trade for the first two decades of the eighteenth century, the prosperity of L&uuml;beck gradually increased, although the town was far removed from the great trade-routes of the world. The Imperial Delegates' Enactment of 1803 (see G<font size=-2>ERMANY</font>) brought it a small increase of territory by assigning to it the portion of that <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> (the <em>area capituli</em>) which lay within its boundaries; the remainder fell to the Duchy of Oldenburg, to which the episcopal line of the House of Gottorp had succeeded in 1773, and forms today the Oldenburg principality of L&uuml;beck. As the imperial delegates had also guaranteed L&uuml;beck perpetual neutrality, and the citizens had begun to level the fortifications, they were unable to offer any resistance to the French, who, after the Battle of Jena, in 1806, pursued Bl&uuml;cher northwards. Occupied by the French on 5 November, the town was pillaged for three days and remained in their possession until 1813. For the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who then numbered between 500 and 600 the foreign occupation brought, in some measure, an equality of <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> with the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and the liberty--never since contested--of <a href="02258b.htm">baptizing</a> and marrying, their co-religionists according to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rites, without outside interference. The Congress of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> recognized L&uuml;beck as a free member of the German League. Subsequently the town devoted itself with great energy to removing all the obstacles impeding the development of its commerce and navigation. These were due principally to the opposition of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, which still occupied Holstein.</p>

<p>The Liberal Constitution of 1848, which guaranteed to the middle classes a great measure of influence in the government of the city side by side with the Senate, contributed very greatly to foster the public spirit of the citizens and initiated a new period of prosperity for the old Hanse town. Its inclusion in the German Customs Union (<em>Zollverein</em>) opened to L&uuml;beck, in 1868, a great field of commercial activity. In 1866 L&uuml;beck had unhesitatingly taken the side of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In the new <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a> its position as a free city is unimpaired: under the protection of the Empire, and during the long epoch of peace since 1871, it has developed, not precipitately, but steadily and surely, and its population has more than doubled (1871: in the city, 39,743, and within the state boundaries, 52,158; 1905: in the city, 91,541, and in the state, 105,857).</p>

<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of L&uuml;beck, whom immigration has increased almost threefold since 1871, are subject to the <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Northern Missions. The <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of L&uuml;beck (1 <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and 3 assistants minister to all the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the free state, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Principality of L&uuml;beck, who live nearer L&uuml;beck than to Eutin, and a portion of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="16070a.htm">Ratzeburg</a>, Lauenberg, Holstein, and Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> soldiers are spiritually subject to the army <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a> at <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, who entrusts them to the care of the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> at L&uuml;beck.</p>

<p>By the Regulation of 18 March, 1904, which determines its relations towards the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the state has reserved to itself the <em>jus circa sacra</em>. The names of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> appointed by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> must be submitted to the Senate with copies of all their certificates of studies. Religious orders and congregations may at any time be excluded by the Senate. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> citizens, who are taxed on an income of more than 1000 marks, must pay a church tax; otherwise, the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenue is derived from the general church and <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> funds, and-- since this is insufficient to meet the expenditure--from the <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> contributions of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who are mostly poor, and from the Bonifatiusverein. To the assistance of this association is also due the &#9;erection of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the Sacred Heart in the town (1888-91) and of the chapel-of-ease in the industrial district of Kucknitz (1909-10). Since 1850 there has been a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, which is conducted by a religious director, and has received since 1905 a grant from the state. In 1874 an establishment of the <a href="03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, from the mother-house at <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, was founded to teach and to care for the sick. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations of L&uuml;beck include those of the Christian Family, the Holy Childhood, Guardian Angels, St. Elizabeth, <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> and one for the adornment of poor churches, an association for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> business men and officials, a men's association; an association for journeymen, one for youths, and a Sodality of Mary for unmarried <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press is represented by the "Nordische Volkszeitung".</p>
