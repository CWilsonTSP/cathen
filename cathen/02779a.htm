<h2 id="section1">Guillaume Bri&ccedil;onnet</h2>

<p>A <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, b. at <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. at Narbonne, 14 December, 1514. He was a younger son of Jean Bri&ccedil;onnet, Lord of Varennes, in Touraine, Secretary to the king and collector-general of Customs. Appointed Superintendent of Finances for the Province of Languedoc under Louis XI, Guillaume Bri&ccedil;onnet discharged the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office with such integrity and efficiency, and showed himself so devoted to the interests of Louis that that monarch recommended him to his successor. Charles VIII made him Secretary of the Treasury, raised him to the first place in the Council of State, and, according to the historian Gicciardini, would undertake nothing in the government of his kingdom without the advice of Bri&ccedil;onnet. Ludovico Sforza, called the Moor, wishing to dispossess his nephew of the Duchy of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and finding himself opposed by Ferdinand, King of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, sent an embassy under the Count of Belgiojoso to Charles to induce the French king to assert his claims to the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> as heir to the house of Anjou. Sforza promised to place all his troops at the king's service. Bri&ccedil;onnet having shortly before this lost his wife, Raoulette de Beaune, by whom he had three sons, had entered the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> and been named <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St.-Malo. To flatter his <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> the <a href="10298a.htm">Milanese</a> ambassadors assured him that the king's influence would raise him to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. Bri&ccedil;onnet, thus won over to the Sforza interest, adroitly encouraged the warlike dispositions of his sovereign, triumphed over the opposition of the royal council, of the Duke of Bourbon, and of Anne of France, the Duke's wife, influenced Charles to sign a secret treaty with Sforza, and assured the king of his ability to raise the funds <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to carry on the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> both on land and sea.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><a href="01289a.htm">Pope Alexander VI</a>, alarmed at the apparent danger threatening <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, promised the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat to Bri&ccedil;onnet if he could prevail upon Charles to abandon his enterprise; but Bri&ccedil;onnet, realizing that he could not govern without flattering the king's passion for conquest, urged him on, and, notwithstanding the dilapidated state of the treasury, succeeded in meeting the expenses of the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>. Accompanying Charles on his expedition, he provoked a mutiny in the French army, by his treachery in sacrificing the <a href="12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, allies of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, to their enemies, the Florentines, and had he not hidden himself form the fury of the soldiers they would have taken his life. Upon this occasion, as upon others, Bri&ccedil;onnet's <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> led him into conduct at variance with his motto: <em>Ditat servata fides</em>. Charles had entered <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a conqueror, greatly irritated against <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> who had stirred up opposition against him; but the adroit Bri&ccedil;onnet reconciled his royal master with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and for reward received the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat. This <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> was conferred in a special consistory held in the king's presence, 16 January, 1495, the new <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> taking the title of <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of St.-Malo, from his <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>.</p>

<p>Bri&ccedil;onnet soon had cause to repent the advice he had given to invade <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. A formidable league was formed for the purpose of cutting off the French retreat, and neither the diplomacy nor the entreaties of the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> had any effect on the hostile generals. The prowess of Charles and the invincible valour of his troops alone saved the French from a humiliating defeat. With 8,000 men the king defeated, at Tornovo, an army of 40,000, and opened a road to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Soon after this Bri&ccedil;onnet, induced by a tempting promise of preferment for one of his sons, tried to persuade Charles to break off the peace negotiations and support with an army the Duke of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans'</a> claims to the Duchy of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Charles, however, preferred the counsels of Philippe de Comines and sacrificed the interests of the duke, and the king's premature death put an end to the influence of Bri&ccedil;onnet, Louis XII giving his confidence to the Cardinal d'Amboise. But whilst serving his king and the State, the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of St.-Malo had not overlooked his own interests; he had obtained from <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> the Bishopric of <a href="11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>. His title being disputed by the nominee of the chapter, there arose a litigation which lasted until the year 1507, when Bri&ccedil;onnet was awarded the title. In 1497 he had received <em><a href="07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> the Bishopric of Toulon, and in the same year succeeded his brother in the archiepiscopal See of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. On the 27th of May, 1498, he <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> Louis XII in his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and followed the king to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. As a peer of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, he assisted at the session of the Council of State at which the marriage of Louis with Jeanne, the daughter of Louis XI, was annulled.</p>

<p>When he had ceased to be a minister of State, Bri&ccedil;onnet retired to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for two years. Louis then made use of his talents to check what he called the arrogance of the warrior <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. By his king's direction Bri&ccedil;onnet took steps to assemble at <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> a council of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> opposed to the policy of Julius, and bent on the reformation of the head and <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> suddenly and secretly with a group of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> whom he had won over, and opened his council at <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, but soon transferred it to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and thence to Lyons. He was, however, summoned to appear before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, was deprived of the Roman purple and <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Louis, on his side, bestowed upon him <em><a href="07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> the rich Abbey of St.-Germain-des-Pres and the government of Languedoc. At the death of <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a> Bri&ccedil;onnet was absolved from all censures and <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, and restored by <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> to the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. He then retired to end his days at Narbonne, for which see he had exchanged <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in a superb mausoleum which he had built for himself in the church of Our Lady.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Whilst in power, Bri&ccedil;onnet showed himself a patron of men of letters; they dedicated their works to him and became his panegyrists. He was called <em>oraculum regis</em> and <em>regni columna</em>. His life was in fact swayed by <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> and occupied by intrigues. He composed a manual of Latin <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, dedicated to Charles VIII. At Saint-Malo he issued several synodal instructions.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Guillaume Bri&ccedil;onnet</h2>

<p><a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, b. at <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a> in 1472; d. at the chateau of Esmant near Montereau, 24 January, 1534. He was a son of Cardinal Bri&ccedil;onnet (see above), and before entering the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> was known as the Count de Montbrun. In 1489 he was named <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lodeve. Distinguished by remarkable judgment, great learning, and a <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of study, he received from Louis XII several preferments, and was named as <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Queen. In 1507 he succeeded his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> as <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St.-Germain-des-Pres. The king entrusted him with delicate and difficult missions, and sent him, the same year that Guillaume became <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as extraordinary ambassador for the purpose of justifying the conduct of his prince against the accusations of the Emperor Maximilian. In an eloquent Latin speech pronounced in the presence of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> fully vindicated Louis. Guillaume enjoyed equally the confidence of <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, who transferred him to the See of Meaux, and sent him as ambassador to <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he resided for two years. As <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St.-Germain, he displayed a great <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the reform of abuses, put an end to disorders, and revived monastic regularity, spirit, and fervour. As <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux, he held a number of <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, and made wise regulations against the depravity of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> and the relaxation of <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, and promoted among his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> a taste for learning, to bring back to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> the disciples of the new <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, who were already numerous in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was no less <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> in opposing the encroachments of the religious and in directing them back to the spirit of their state. The Cordeliers, a branch of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, accused the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, basing their accusation on the protection given by him to the partisans of <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> defended himself and was declared innocent. His <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of letters <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to increase considerably the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of the Abbey of St.-Germain. He translated into French the "Contemplatines Idiotae de amore divino".</p>

<h2 id="section3">Robert Bri&ccedil;onnet</h2>

<p><a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, fifth son of Jean Bri&ccedil;onnet, an elder brother of the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> [see (1)]. Date of birth uncertain; d. at <a href="10603b.htm">Moulins</a>, 3 June, 1497. He owed to the credit which Guillaume had with Charles VIII his rapid elevation to public offices and dignities. He was named Canon of St.-Aignan at <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the rich Abbey of St.-Vaast at <a href="01752c.htm">Arras</a>, and in 1493 he was raised to the archiepiscopal See of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>, four years before the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> was appointed to that <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. Charles appointed him President of the Superior Tribunal of Finances, and Chancellor of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. He enjoyed this new dignity for only twenty-two months before his death. He showed himself, as did his brothers and nephews, a patron of men of letters.</p>
