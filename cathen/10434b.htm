<p>(Properly, JEAN-BAPTISTE POQUELIN, the name by which he became known to fame having been assumed when he went on the stage, to avoid embarrassing his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>).</p>

<p><a href="06166a.htm">French</a> comic poet; b. at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 15 Jan., 1622; d. there 17 Feb., 1673. He was the son a <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> furniture dealer who was also a valet-de-chambre to the king, and succeeded his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> in the latter of these two capacities. After making his studies with the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at the Coll&egrave;ge de Clermont, he seems to have studied <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> in some provincial town &mdash; perhaps Orl&eacute;ans. It is not known, however, if he ever took his licentiate. The stage very soon attracted him and absorbed him. At twenty-one he entered the theatrical company, organized under the name of "L'Illustre Th&eacute;&acirc;tre", in which were Madeleine B&eacute;jart and her brothers. The troupe engaged a band of four musicians at the cost of one <em>livre</em> per day, and a dancer, who was to receive thirty-five <em>sols</em> per day and five <em>sols</em> extra for every day when there was a performance. The business started with a deficit, and Moli&egrave;re, who appears to have been chosen president by his associates, was arrested for <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>. He was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Ch&acirc;telet, but released on his own recognizances.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the course of the subsequent wanderings through different parts of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, Moli&egrave;re composed some small comic pieces of no importance, of which two have been preserved &mdash; "La Jalousie de Barbouill" &mdash; and "Le M&eacute;decin Volant". Afterwards, about 1653 or 1655, he staged, at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, "L'Etourdi". In this he began to use the language of fine comedy which <a href="04374b.htm">Corneille</a> had created ten or twelve years before. "Le D&eacute;pit Amoureux", produced at B&eacute;ziers in 1656, should also be mentioned here. Before long the "Illustre Th&eacute;&acirc;tre" regained confidence to face the <a href="11480c.htm">Parisian</a> public; we find it in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1658. Next year the troupe, now authorized to call itself "Troupe de Monsieur, Fr&egrave;re du Roi" performed "Les Pr&eacute;cieuses Ridicules". In this comedy Moli&egrave;re declared <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the spirit of refined humbuggery (<em>l'esprit pr&eacute;cieux</em>), and he never ceased to be its enemy, as witness "Les Femmes Savantes" (1672), one of his last pieces. The last twelve years of his life saw the production of his most famous works. "L'Ecole des Maris" (1661) shows the beauty of a confiding and gentle character in a man; "Les F&acirc;cheux" (also 1661) was written in fifteen days; "L'Ecole des Femmes" (1662) gives another lesson to husbands &mdash; which was very creditable to the playwright, for he himself, at the age of forty, had just married a girl of twenty, Madeleine B&eacute;jart's sister, the volatile Armande who was to give him so much trouble. The "Critique de L'Ecole des Femmes" and the "Impromptu de Versailles" (1663) are two little prose pieces in which the writer defends his comedy of the preceding year and attacks his critics. "Tartuffe" (1664), the famous comedy, at first in three acts, afterwards in five, deals trenchant blows at <a href="07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>, unfortunately, however, often striking <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> virtue at the same time. After its first production the public performance of this piece was forbidden, and the ban was not removed for five years.</p>

<p>In the interval Moli&egrave;re wrote: "Don Juan" (or "Le Festin de Pierre") (1665), apparently intended as a revenge for the suppression of "Tartufe"; "Le Misanthrope" (1669) a great comedy of character; "Amphitryon" (1668), three acts in verse of various measures, where Jupiter assumes the form of the Theban general, Amphitryon, in order to betray his wife, Alemena; lastly, "L'Avare" (1668). Excepting "Les Femmes Savantes", already mentioned, the comedies of his last four years exhibit a great deal of gaiety, but not so much breadth &mdash; "Monsieur de Pourceaugnac" and "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme", in 1669, "Les Fourberies de Scapin", in 1671 and "Le Malade Imaginaire" (1673). While on stage playing in "Le Malade Imaginaire", the author was seized with a violent h&aelig;morrhage; he was carried home, and died.</p>

<p>In him <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> lost the greatest of the comic writers whom her history has produced. Judging Moli&egrave;re exclusively from a literary point of view, it must be admitted that he does not owe his <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a> to the quantity of dramatic entanglement in his plays; he owes it above all to the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of his portraiture. His friend <a href="02623a.htm">Boileau</a> called him "the looker-on" (<em>le contemplateur</em>). He <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> how to look at the world, to note its vices and its failings, and his genius had the power of combining what he saw, melting all his observations together, adding to them, and thus creating beings who are no longer particular <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but are recognizable as men of their whole period &mdash; often of all periods of humanity. Moreover, the characters are his chief concern: with him, as with <a href="12630b.htm">Racine</a>, the characters carry the whole piece, they are its <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. His art may at times fail in other points &mdash; as in his <em>d&eacute;nouements</em>, which are often ill contrived &mdash; but in that one respect he is always admirable. His plays, then, present a portrait of the heart of a man, but a profile portrait drawn by a satirist, whose business is to see only the defective side of it, and a dramatic writer, who is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> by the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of stage optics to emphasize certain lines. This verisimilitude &mdash; or, as his friend La Fontaine expressed it, carefulness "not to go one step away from nature" &mdash; is found in all Moli&egrave;re's works. It is particularly visible in his style. Good critics, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, have found fault with Moli&egrave;re's style, particularly in his verse; <a href="02623a.htm">Boileau</a>, <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, and La Bruy&egrave;re did so in the seventeenth century; Vauvenargues, in the eighteenth; Th&eacute;ophile Gautier and others, in the nineteenth. On the other hand, a whole <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> has arisen in the last fifty years to extol this writer: for the Moli&egrave;rists, as they have been called, Moli&egrave;re is above all criticism; they preach a sort of cultus of Moli&egrave;re. To be more judicious, we must be more moderate. Admitting that the language of comedy, which is that of familiar conversation, permits him certain liberties, which he cannot be fairly blamed for using, still, making all due allowance for the nature of his medium, there is no denying that his style suffers from real carelessness &mdash; useless repetitions, incoherent metaphors, heavy and entangled phrases. Moli&egrave;re was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to write quickly; he was an improviser, but a genius of improvisation. For his style, in spite of its faults, is still, as <a href="02623a.htm">Boileau</a> said to <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, a "rare" style. Frank and natural, he excels in making reason and good sense talk. It is the style of a poet, too warm, highly coloured, brilliant. Lastly, one finds in him striking words and striking touches, which come spontaneously, and add to his charm.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As for morality, it owes Moli&egrave;re much less than literature does. Although he gave out, in his prefaces, that it was his wish and <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> as a dramatic poet, to be of service to morality, he has been severely censured in this regard, from <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. While he never put on the stage &mdash; as is so often done in these days &mdash; a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> guilty of violating her marriage <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, or about to violate them, yet he has been reproached with the presentation of other dangerous pictures. Furthermore, he is always on the side of the young people, who surely need no encouragement in their <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> propensities. All his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>, all his satires, are for <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>; all the unpleasant failings depicted by his comedies reside in the fathers and the old people; the laugh is always at their expense, except when their egoism excites horror. It must be confessed that, while the passions of the young king, <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, had only too much reason to be pleased with the author of "Amphitryon", religion has no cause to approve the author of "Tartufe". Moli&egrave;re's <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was not as profound as that of <a href="04374b.htm">Corneille</a>, <a href="12630b.htm">Racine</a>, <a href="02623a.htm">Boileau</a>, and nearly all the illustrious writers of his time. And yet, when there was question of his being given <a href="03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>, and the <em>cur&eacute;</em> hesitated, on the ground that the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> had arrived too late to give <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> to the comedian, who, it may almost be said, passed from the stage to the tribunal of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, his <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that he had received the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in the last previous paschal season.</p>
