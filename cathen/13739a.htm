<p>Foundress and first superior of the <a href="03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>; born in <a href="11020a.htm">New York City</a>, 28 Aug., 1774, of non-Catholic <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> of high position; died at Emmitsburg, <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 4 Jan., 1821.</p>

<p>Her father, Dr. Richard Bayley (born in <a href="04253b.htm">Connecticut</a> and <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>), was the first professor of <a href="01457e.htm">anatomy</a> at Columbia College and eminent for his work as health officer of the Port of New York. Her mother, Catherine Charlton, daughter of an <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> of Staten Island, N.Y., died when Elizabeth was three years old, leaving two other young daughters. The father married again, and among the children of this second marriage was Guy Charleton Bayley, whose <a href="04347a.htm">convert</a> son, <a href="02359a.htm">James Roosevelt Bayley</a>, became <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Elizabeth always showed great affection for her stepmother, who was a devout <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a>, and for her stepbrothers and sisters. Her <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> was chiefly conducted by her father, a brilliant man of great natural <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>, who trained her to self-restraint as well as in intellectual pursuits. She read industriously, her notebooks indicating a special interest in religious and historical subjects. She was very religious, wore a small crucifix around her neck, and took great delight in reading the <a href="13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>, especially the <a href="../bible/psa000.htm">Psalms</a>, a practice she retained until her death.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>She was married on 25 Jan., 1794, in St. Paul's Church, <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a>, to William Magee Seton, of that city, by Bishop Prevoost. In her sister-in-law, Rebecca Seton, she found the "friend of her <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>", and as they went about on missions of mercy they were called the "Protestant Sisters of Charity". Business troubles culminated on the death of her father-in-law in 1798. Elizabeth and her husband presided over the large <a href="11322b.htm">orphaned</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>; she shared his financial anxieties, aiding him with her sound judgment. Dr. Bayley's death in 1801 was a great trial to his favourite child. In her anxiety for his <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> she had offered to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, during his fatal illness, the <a href="09238c.htm">life</a> of her infant daughter Catherine. Catherine's <a href="09238c.htm">life</a> was spared, however, she died at the age of ninety, as Mother Catherine of the <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a>. In 1803 Mr. Seton's health required a sea voyage; he started with his wife and eldest daughter for <a href="09131a.htm">Leghorn</a>, where the Filicchi brothers, business friends of the Seton firm, resided. The other children, William, Richard, Rebecca, and Catherine, were left to the care of Rebecca Seton.</p>

<p>From a journal which Mrs. Seton kept during her travels we learn of her heroic effort to sustain the drooping spirits of her husband during the voyage, followed by a long detention in quarantine, and until his death at <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (27 Dec., 1803). She and her daughter remained for some <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> with the Filicchi <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>. While with these <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> and in the churches of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> Mrs. Seton first began to see the beauty of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Delayed by her daughter's illness and then by her own, she sailed for home accompanied by Antonio Filicchi, and reached <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a> on 3 June, 1804. Her sister-in-law, Rebecca, died in July.</p>

<p>A time of great spiritual perplexity began for Mrs. Seton, whose <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> was, "If I am right Thy grace impart still in the right to stay. If I am wrong Oh, teach my heart to find the better way." Mr. Hobart (afterwards an <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>), who had great influence over her, used every effort to dissuade her from joining the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, while Mr. Filicchi presented the claims of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> religion and arranged a correspondence between Elizabeth and <a href="03650a.htm">Bishop Cheverus</a>. Through Mr. Filicchi she also wrote to <a href="03381b.htm">Bishop Carroll</a>. Elizabeth meanwhile added <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> to her <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> for light. The result was that on <a href="01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>, 14 March, 1805, she was received into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by Father Matthew O'Brien in St. Peter's Church, Barclay Street, <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a>. On 25 March she made her first Communion with extraordinary fervour; even the faint shadow of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a> had had such an attraction for her that she used to hasten from one church to another to receive it twice each <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a>. She well understood the storm that her <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> would raise among her <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> relatives and friends at the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> she most needed their help. Little of her husband's fortune was left, but numerous relatives would have provided amply for her and her children had not this barrier been raised. She joined an English <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gentleman named White, who, with his wife, was opening a school for boys in the suburbs of <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a>, but the widely circulated report that this was a proselytizing scheme forced the school to close.</p>

<p>A few faithful friends arranged for Mrs. Seton to open a boarding-house for some of the boys of a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> school taught by the <a href="04570a.htm">curate</a> of St. Mark's. In January, 1806, Cecilia Seton, Elizabeth's young sister-in-law, became very ill and begged to see the ostracized <a href="04347a.htm">convert</a>; Mrs. Seton was sent for, and became a constant visitor. Cecilia told her that she desired to become a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. When Cecilia's decision was known threats were made to have Mrs. Seton expelled from the state by the Legislature. On her recovery Cecilia fled to Elizabeth for refuge and was received into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. She returned to her brother's <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> on his wife's death. Mrs. Seton's boarding-house for boys had to be given up. Her sons had been sent by the Filicchis to <a href="06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>. She hoped to find a refuge in some <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where her teaching would support her three daughters. <a href="03381b.htm">Bishop Carroll</a> did not approve, so she relinquished this plan. Father <a href="05178c.htm">Father Dubourg, S.S.</a>, from St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, met her in <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a>, and suggested opening in <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> a school for girls. After a long delay and many privations, she and her daughters reached <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> on Corpus Christi, 1808. Her boys were brought there to St. Mary's College, and she opened a school next to the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Mary's Seminary and was delighted with the opportunities for the practice of her religion, for it was only with the greatest difficulty she was able to get to daily <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> and Communion in <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a>. The <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> life for which she had longed ever since her stay in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> now seemed less impracticable. Her life was that of a religious, and her quaint costume was fashioned after one worn by certain <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Cecilia Conway of Philadelphia, who had contemplated going to <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> to fulfill her <a href="15498a.htm">religious vocation</a>, joined her; soon other <a href="12319b.htm">postulants</a> arrived, while the little school had all the pupils it could accommodate.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Mr. Cooper, a <a href="15451a.htm">Virginian</a> <a href="04347a.htm">convert</a> and seminarian, offered $10,000 to found an institution for teaching <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a> children. A farm was bought half a mile from the village of Emmitsburg and two miles from <a href="10605a.htm">Mt. St. Mary's College</a>. Meanwhile Cecilia Seton and her sister Harriet came to Mrs. Seton in <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. As a preliminary to the formation of the new community, Mrs. Seton took <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> privately before <a href="03381b.htm">Archbishop Carroll</a> and her daughter Anna. In June, 1809, the community was transferred to Emmitsburg to take charge of the new institution. The great fervour and <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> of Mother Seton, imitated by her sisters, made the many hardships of their situation seem light. In Dec., 1809, Harriet Seton, who was received into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at Emmitsburg, died there, and Cecilia in Apr., 1810.</p>

<p><a href="06093a.htm">Bishop Flaget</a> was commissioned in 1810 by the community to obtain in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the rules of the <a href="03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>. Three of these sisters were to be sent to train the young community in the spirit of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, but <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> forbade them to leave <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The letter announcing their coming is extant at Emmitsburg. The rule, however, with some modifications, was approved by <a href="03381b.htm">Archbishop Carroll</a> in Jan., 1812, and adopted.</p>

<p>Against her will, and despite the fact that she had also to care for her children, Mrs. Seton was elected superior. Many joined the community; Mother Seton's daughter, Anna, died during her <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> (12 March, 1812), but had been permitted to pronounce her <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> on her death-bed. Mother Seton and the eighteen sisters made their <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> on 19 July, 1813. The fathers superior of the community were the <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, Fathers <a href="05178c.htm">Dubourg</a>, David, and <a href="05178b.htm">Dubois</a>. <a href="05178b.htm">Father Dubois</a> held the post for fifteen years and laboured to impress on the community the spirit of St. Vincent's Sisters of Charity, forty of whom he had had under his care in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The fervour of the community won admiration everywhere. The school for the daughters of the well-to-do prospered, as it continues to do (1912), and enabled the sisters to do much work among the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>. In 1814 the sisters were given charge of an <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> in Philadelphia; in 1817 they were sent to <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a>. The previous year (1816) Mother Seton's daughter, Rebecca, after long suffering, died at Emmitsburg; her son Richard, who was placed with the Filicchi firm in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, died a few years after his mother. William, the eldest, joined the United States Navy and died in 1868. The most distinguished of his children are Most. Rev. Robert Seton, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Heliopolis (author of a memoir of his grandmother, "Roman Essays", and many contributions to the "American Catholic Quarterly" and other reviews), and <a href="13740a.htm">William Seton</a>.</p>

<p>Mother Seton had great facility in writing. Besides the translation of many <a href="01767c.htm">ascetical</a> French works (including the life of Saint Vincent de Paul, and of <a href="09133b.htm">Mlle. Le Gras</a>) for her community she has left copious diaries and correspondence that show a <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> all on fire with the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. Great spiritual desolation purified her <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> during a great portion of her <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>, but she cheerfully took the royal road of the cross. For several years the saintly <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (then Father) Bruti was her <a href="05024a.htm">director</a>. The third time she was elected mother (1819) she protested that it was the election of the dead, but she lived for two years, suffering finally from a pulmonary affection. Her perfect sincerity and great charm aided her wonderfully in the work of sanctifying <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. In 1880 Cardinal Gibbons (then <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>) urged the steps be taken toward her <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a>. The result of the official inquiries in the cause of Mother Seton, held in <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> during several years, were brought to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by special messenger, and placed in the hands of the postulator of the cause on 7 June, 1911.</p>

<p>Her cause is entrusted to the <a href="10357a.htm">Priests of the Congregation of the Mission</a>, whose superior general in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> is also superior of the Sisters of Charity with which the Emmitsburg community was incorporated in 1850, after the withdrawal of the greater number of the sisters (at the suggestion of <a href="07516a.htm">Archbishop Hughes</a>) of the <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a> houses in 1846. This union had been contemplated for some <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, but the need of a stronger bond at Emmitsburg, shown by the <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a> separation, hastened it. It was effected with the loss of only the <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> community of six sisters. With the <a href="10779c.htm">Newark</a> and <a href="07117b.htm">Halifax</a> offshoots of the <a href="11020a.htm">New York</a> community and the Greenburg foundation from <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, the sisters originating from Mother Seton's foundation number (1911) about 6000. The original Emittsburg community now wearing the cornette and observing the rule just as <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent</a> gave it, naturally surpasses any of the others in number. It is found in about thirty <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and forms a part of the worldwide sisterhood, whilst the others are rather <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> communities.</p>

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Elizabeth Ann Seton was <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1963 and <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> on September 14, 1975.]</p>
