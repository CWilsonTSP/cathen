<p>The Congress of Ems was a meeting of the representatives of the German <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Friedrich Karl von Erthal of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Maximilian Franz of Cologne, Clemens Wenceslaus of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and Hieronymus von Colloredo of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, at the little town of Bad-Ems, near Coblenz, in August, 1786, for the purpose of protesting against <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> interference in the exercise of episcopal powers and fixing the future relations between these <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and the <a href="12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>.</p>

<p>The Gallican principles concerning the relation between the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, which had been disseminated in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by <a href="07463a.htm">Hontheim</a>, the Auxiliary <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> (1748-1790), in his treatise "De statu ecclesi&aelig; et legitim&acirc; potestate Rom. Pontificis" (1763) under the pseudonym "Febronius", were shared by some of the most influential <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> became confirmed in the position which they took towards the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by the encouragement and support of <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, who arrogated to himself both temporal and <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a>. As early as 1769 the representatives of the Elector-Archbishops of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, at a meeting held in Coblenz, had drawn up a list of thirty-one articles, most of which were directed against the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>. The proximate occasion of the Congress of Ems was the erection of an Apostolic nunciature in <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> (27 Feb., 1785) and the appointment of Zoglio, titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02046a.htm">Athens</a>, as <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> (27 June), with <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the entire territory of the Elector Karl Theodor, which then comprised <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> with the Rhine Palatinate and the former Duchies of J&uuml;lich and Berg. <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> erected this nunciature upon the urgent request of the Elector of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, who was loath to have parts of his territory under the <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who, being electors like himself, were rather his equals than his subordinates. He had previously suggested to the Elector-Archbishops of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> to appoint special vicars-general for their districts in his territory. Upon their refusal he requested <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> to erect separate <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for his territory, but in deference to the wishes of the three elector-archbishops, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> also refused. Finally the Elector of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> asked for the above-mentioned nunciature, and despite the protests of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> his wish was granted.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Meanwhile Bellisomi, the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, was transferred to <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, and <a href="11380b.htm">Pacca</a>, the titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04615b.htm">Damietta</a> was appointed to succeed him at Cologne. Maximilian Franz, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a> (a brother of <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>), refused to see him, and none of the three elector-archbishops <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> his credentials. Despite protests, both <a href="11380b.htm">Pacca</a> and Zoglio began to exercise their powers as <a href="11160a.htm">nuncios</a>. Relying on the support which <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> had promised, the three elector-archbishops and the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> planned concerted action against <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and sent their representatives to Ems to hold a congress. Von Erthal of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, who was the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of the opposition, was represented by his <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> Valentine Heimes; Maximilian Franz of Cologne, by his privy councillor Heinrich von Tautph&auml;us; Clemens Wenceslaus of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, by his privy councillor and official representative in temporal matters, Joseph Ludwig Beck; Colloredo of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, by his consistorial councillor, Johann Michael B&ouml;nicke. On 25 August, 1786, these <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> representatives signed the <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a> "Punctation of Ems", consisting of twenty-three articles which aimed at making the German <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> practically independent of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For the text of the articles see Munch, "Sammlung aller &auml;lteren und neueren Concordate" (Leipzig, 1831), I, 404-423.</p>

<p>Assuming that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave unlimited power of binding and loosing to the Apostles and their successors, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the "Punctation" maintains that all prerogatives and reservations which were not actually connected with the primacy during the first three centuries owe their origin to the <a href="05773a.htm">Pseudo-Isidore decretals</a>, universally acknowledged as <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>, and, hence, that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> must look upon all interference of the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> with the exercise of their episcopal functions in their own <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> as encroachments on their <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. Upon these <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> principles the four <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> based their demands, which may be summarized as follows: all direct appeals to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> must be discontinued; all exempt <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> must become subject to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in whose districts the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are situated; no German <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> must have generals, <a href="12514b.htm">provincials</a>, or other superiors who do not reside in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> need not obtain quinquennial faculties from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, because by virtue of their office they can dispense from abstinence, from matrimonial impediments, including the second degree of <a href="04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> and the second and first degrees of affinity, from solemn religious <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> and the <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> resulting from <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>; <a href="03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> and ordinances of the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> are binding in each <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> only after the respective <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has given his <em>placet;</em> all Apostolic nunciatures must be abolished; the manner of conferring <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> and the procedure in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lawsuits must be changed in favour of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; the episcopal <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> must be changed so that it shall not appear to be the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of a vassal, etc.</p>

<p>It may easily be seen that the articles of the "Punctation" lower the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy to a merely honorary one and advocate an independence of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> in regard to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> which is entirely incompatible with the Unity and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Still the "Punctation" was immediately ratified by the four <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and sent to <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> with an <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> request for his support. The emperor was pleased with the articles and would have pledged his unqualified support if his councillors, especially <a href="08611b.htm">Kaunitz</a>, had not for political reasons advised him otherwise. In his reply of 16 Nov., 1786, the emperor wisely makes his support dependent on the condition that the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> gain the consent of their suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the superiors of the exempt <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the estates into whose districts their <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> extends. The suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, especially the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned prince-bishops August von Styrum of Speier and Franz Ludwig von Erthal of W&uuml;rzburg-Bamberg (a brother of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>), protested against the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> tendency of the "Punctation" and saw in the anti-papal procedure of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> merely an attempt to increase their own power to the detriment of their suffragans. The Elector of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> likewise remained a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> defender of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and his <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and even the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> King <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was an opponent of the "Punctation" and favoured the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> <a href="11380b.htm">Pacca</a> at Cologne.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Still the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> insisted on their demands. When the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at Cologne by authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> granted a matrimonial <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the second degree of <a href="04264a.htm">consanguinity</a> to Prince von Hohenlohe-Bartenstein and Countess Blankenheim, Archbishop Maximilian Franz of Cologne addressed to him a strong protest forbidding him for the future the exercise of all <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the <a href="04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> themselves now began to grant <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> from such degrees of relationship as were not contained in their ordinary quinquennial faculties, just as if the "Punctation of Ems" were in full force. When the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, by order of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, informed the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> that all marriages contracted by virtue of such <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> were invalid, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> ordered their <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> to return the circular to the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> and to obtain all future <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> directly from their ordinary, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> was now near to a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Fortunately, von Erthal of Mains needed the services of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He desired Karl Theodor von Dalberg as coadjutor, and, to obtain the consent of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he withdrew, at least apparently, from the "Punctation" and obtained a renewal of his quinquennial faculties from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 9 Aug., 1787. Similarly the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> asked for quinquennial faculties as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, but not as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Von Erthal's submission to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was only a pretended one. He continued his opposition and on 2 June, 1788, requested <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, in the name of himself and the three other <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, to bring the affair concerning the German <a href="11160a.htm">nuncios</a> before a diet. But soon the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> discovered that all the estates were opposed to the "Punctation" and that a diet would rather retard than accelerate the fulfilment of their wishes. For this reason they addressed a letter to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1 Dec., 1788) asking the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to put an end to the unedifying <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dissensions in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by withdrawing the faculties from the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncios</a> and by sending representatives to the German estates with authority to come to an amicable agreement regarding the other demands of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. In answer to this request appeared the publication of a memorable document composed by order of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and entitled: "Sanctissimi Dom. nostri Pii Pap&aelig; VI responsio ad Metropolitanos Moguntinum, Trevirensem, Coloniensem et Salisburgensem super Nunciaturis Apostolicis" (Rome, 1789). It was a masterpiece in form and contents of Apostolic firmness and paternal reproof. After presenting a dispassionate and objective view of the whole litigation, the document refutes all the arguments of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> against <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> nunciatures, shows how wrong it was for the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> to rebel against <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, explains that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> cannot send representatives to worldly estates who have no <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to pass judgment on <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, and admonishes the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> to give up their untenable position towards the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> writing was not without effect. Archbishop Wenceslaus of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, who had long desired an amicable settlement of the odious affair, into which, it appears, he was drawn against his will, publicly withdrew from the "Punctation" on 20 Feb., 1790, and admonished his colleagues to follow his example. They, however, continued their opposition and on occasion of the imperial capitulation of Leopold II (1790) and that of Francis II (1792) obtained the promise that their complaints concerning the nunciatures would be attended to as soon as possible by a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the diet. The threatening progress of the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> finally changed the attitude of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Cologne and Salzburg, but the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> clung to the "Punctation" until the victorious French army invaded his electorate, and he was deprived of all his possessions west of the Rhine, at the Peace of Campo Formio, in 1797.</p>
