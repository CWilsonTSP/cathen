<p><a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>; he was the son and namesake of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bookseller, and was born in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, 25 Jan., 1540; executed at Tyburn, 1 Dec., 1581. A city company sent the promising child to a grammar <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> and to Christ Church Hospital. When <a href="09766a.htm">Mary Tudor</a> entered <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> in state as queen, he was the schoolboy chosen to give the Latin salutatory to her majesty. Sir Thomas White, lord mayor, who built and endowed St. John's College at <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, accepted Campion as one of his first scholars, appointed him junior fellow at seventeen, and, dying, gave him his last messages for his academic <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. Campion shone at Oxford in 1560, when he delivered one oration at the reburial of Amy Robsart, and another at the funeral of the founder of his own college; and for twelve years he was to be followed and imitated as no man ever was in an English <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> except himself and <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a>. He took both his degrees, and became a celebrated tutor, and, by 1568, junior proctor. Queen Elizabeth had visited Oxford two years before; she and Dudley, then chancellor, won by Campion's bearing, beauty, and wit, bade him ask for what he would. Successes, local responsibilities, and allurements, his natural ease of disposition, the representations, above all, of his friend Bishop Cheyney of Gloucester, blinded Campion in regard to his course as a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>: he took the Oath of Supremacy, and <a href="04647c.htm">deacon's</a> orders according to the new rite. Afterthoughts developing into scruples, scruples into anguish, he broke off his <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> Oxford life when his proctorship ended, and betook himself to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, to await the reopening of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a> University, an ancient <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> foundation temporarily extinct. Sir Henry Sidney, the lord deputy, was interested in Campion's future as well as in the revival which, however, fell through. With Philip Sidney, then a boy, Campion was to have a touching interview in 1577.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As too <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minded an <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a>, Campion was suspected, and exposed to danger. Hidden in friendly houses, he composed his treatise called "A History of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>" Written from an English standpoint it gave much offence to the native <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and was severely criticized, in the next century, by Geoffrey Keating In his <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> history of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Urged to further effort by the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="09727a.htm">Gregory Martin</a>, he crossed to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in disguise and under an assumed name, reaching <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> in time to witness the trial of one of the earliest Oxonian <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, <a href="08485b.htm">Dr. John Storey</a>. Campion now recognized his vocation and hastened to the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a>. Cecil lamented to Richard Stanihurst the expatriation of "one of the diamonds of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>." At <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> Campion remained for his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course and its lesser degree, but then set out as a barefoot pilgrim to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, arriving there just before the death of <a href="06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>; "for I meant", as he said at his examination, "to enter into the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, thereof to <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> and to be professed". This he accomplished promptly in April (1573), being the first <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> received by Mercurianus, the fourth general. As the English province was as yet non-existent, he was allotted to that of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, entering on his <a href="11144a.htm">noviceship</a> at Prague and passing his probation year at <a href="03011c.htm">Br&uuml;nn</a> in <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. Returning to <a href="12338a.htm">Prague</a>, he taught in the college and wrote a couple of sacred dramas; and there he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1578. Meanwhile, Dr. Allen was organizing the apostolic work of the English Mission, and rejoiced to secure Fathers Robert Parsons and Edmund Campion as his first <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> helpers. In the garden at <a href="03011c.htm">Br&uuml;nn</a>, Campion had had a vision, in which <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> foretold to him his <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Comrades at Prague were moved to make a scroll for <em>P. Edmundus Campianus Martyr</em>, and to <a href="11395a.htm">paint</a> a prophetic garland of roses within his cell. Parsons and Campion set out from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had many adventures, and called upon <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> in <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and upon Beza in Geneva. Campion was met in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, and fitly clothed, armed, and mounted by a devoted young convert friend. His office was chiefly to reclaim <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who were wavering or temporizing under the pressure of governmental tyranny; but his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> to win <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, his preaching, his whole saintly and soldierly <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>, made a general and profound impression. An alarm was raised and he fled to the North, where he fell again to writing and produced his famous tract, the "Decem Rationes". He returned to <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, only to withdraw again, this time towards Norfolk. A spy, a former steward of the Roper <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, one George Eliot, was hot upon his track, and ran him and others down at Lyford Grange near Wantage in Berkshire on 17 July, 1581.</p>

<p>Amid scenes of violent excitement, Campion was derisively paraded through the streets of his native city, bound hand and foot, riding backwards, with a paper stuck in his hat to denote the "seditious <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>". First thrown into Little Ease at the Tower, he was carried privately to the house of his old patron, the Earl of Leicester; there he encountered the queen herself, and received earnest proffers of liberty and preferments would he but forsake his papistry. Hopton having tried in vain the same blandishments, on Campion's return to the Tower, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> was then examined under torture, and was reported to have betrayed those who had harboured him. Several arrests were made on the strength of the lie. He had asked for a public disputation. But when it came off in the Norman <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Tower, before the Dean of St. Paul's and other divines, Campion had been denied opportunity to prepare his debate, and had been severely racked. Thus weakened, he stood through the four long conferences, without chair, table, or notes, and stood undefeated. <a href="07503a.htm">Philip Howard</a>, Earl of Arundel, who was looking on in the flush of worldly <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a>, became thereby inspired to return to <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> service. The privy council, at its wits' end over so purely spiritual a "traitor", hatched a plot to impeach Campion's loyalty, and called in the hirelings Eliot and Munday as accusers. A ridiculous trial ensued in Westminster Hall, 20 Nov., 1581. Campion, pleading not guilty, was quite unable to hold up his often-wrenched right arm, seeing which, a fellow <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, first <a href="08663a.htm">kissing</a> it, raised it for him. He made a magnificent defence. But the sentence was death, by hanging, drawing, and quartering: a sentence received by the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> with a joyful shout of <em>Haec dies</em> and <em>Te Deum</em>. Campion, with <a href="12636b.htm">Sherwin</a> and <a href="01296b.htm">Briant</a>, who were on a separate hurdle, was dragged to Tyburn on 1 December. Passing Newgate arch, he lifted himself as best he could to salute the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> still <em>in situ</em>. On the scaffold, when interrupted and taunted to express his mind concerning the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> Elizabeth, he answered only by a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> for her, "your Queen and my Queen". He was a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Englishman with political opinions which were not Allen's, though he died, as much as ever Felton did, for the primacy of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The people loudly lamented his fate; and another great harvest of conversions began. A wild, generous-hearted youth, <a href="15540a.htm">Henry Walpole</a>, standing by, got his white doublet stained with Campion's blood; the incident made him, too, in time, a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Historians of all <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> are agreed that the charges against Campion were wholesale sham. They praise his high intelligence, his beautiful gaiety, his fiery energy, his most <a href="03691a.htm">chivalrous</a> gentleness. He had renounced all opportunity for a dazzling career in a world of master men. Every tradition of Edmund Campion, every remnant of his written words, and not least his unstudied golden letters, show us that he was nothing less than a man of genius; truly one of the great Elizabethans, but holy as none other of them all. He was <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> on 9 December, 1886, and <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Paul VI in 1970. <a href="12734a.htm">Relics</a> of him are preserved in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Prague, in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, Stonyhurst, and Roehampton. A not very convincing portrait was made soon after his death for the Ges&ugrave; in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the supervision of many who had known him. Of this there is a copy in oils at <a href="14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>, and a brilliantly engraved print in <a href="07162a.htm">Hazart's</a> "Kerckelycke Historie" (Antwerp, 1669), Vol. III (Enghelandt, etc.), though not in every copy of that now scarce work.</p>
