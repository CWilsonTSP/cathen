<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF TARRAGONA (TARRACONENSIS)</p>

<p>Bounded on the north by Barcelona and <a href="09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>, on the east by Barcelona, on the south by the Mediterranean Sea and <a href="14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>, and on the west by <a href="14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>. It comprises the civil Provinces of Tarragona and L&eacute;rida, and its capital city has 24,335 inhabitants. Its suffragans are Barcelona, <a href="09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>, <a href="06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, <a href="15223b.htm">Urgel</a>, <a href="15405a.htm">Vich</a>, <a href="14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>, and <a href="14138c.htm">Solsona</a>.</p>

<p>Tarragona is one of the most ancient cities of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, probably of Iberian origin, as its <a href="11152a.htm">coins</a> and Cyclopean walls indicate. The Romans selected Tarragona as the centre of their government in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In the division it was the capital first of Hither Spain (<em>Hispania Citerior</em>) and then of the Province of Tarraconensis. In the fifth century it was overrun by the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, Suevi, and Alani. The <a href="15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> king, Euric, took possession of it in 475 and totally demolished it. During the occupation of the <a href="15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> it flourished once more, but the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> again destroyed it in 719.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Tarragona is undoubtedly one of the most ancient in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, holding as it does the tradition of the coming of <a href="08279b.htm">St. James</a> and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. The visit of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> to Tarragona is not altogether beyond the range of possibilities, supposing that he came from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, as he promised to do, in the <a href="13156a.htm">Epistle to the Romans</a>, and as <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> affirms that he did.</p>

<p>The first written testimony which we have concerning the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Tarragona dates from the third century. This is in the Acts of the Martyrdom of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Fructuosus and his <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> Augurius and Eulogius. The list of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Tarragona, therefore, begins with St. Fructuosus, but it is supposed that other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whose names have been lost to us, preceded him. The <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> of Tarragona, which was <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> at that <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, was represented at the <a href="01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (314) by two <a href="12451a.htm">procurators</a>, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Probatius and the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> Castorius. <a href="07356a.htm">Himerius</a>, who sent the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Basianus to <a href="04613a.htm">Pope St. Damasus</a>, and who obtained a letter from <a href="14026a.htm">Pope St. Siricius</a>, was <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarragona in 384. It is also conjectured that the Hilarius who was the subject of the <a href="04670b.htm">Decretal</a> issued by <a href="08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> was also a <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tarragona. Ascanio was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 465, and previous to 516 we find the name of Archbishop John, who, on 6 November, 516, assembled all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his <a href="12514a.htm">province</a> and held the first <a href="12515a.htm">provincial council</a> of Tarragona, at which ten <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present. In 517 he assembled another <a href="12515a.htm">provincial council</a> in <a href="06530a.htm">Gerona</a>. Sergius, who was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 535 to 546, held councils in <a href="02288e.htm">Barcelona</a> and <a href="09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>. <a href="08586a.htm">St. Justus</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15223b.htm">Urgel</a>, <a href="04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to him his commentary on the Song of Solomon. Tranquillinus was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for many years previous to 560. He had been a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> in the Monastery of Asana, under the direction of St. Victornus. Artemius, <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> prior to 589, was not able to attend the Third Council of Toledo, but sent a substitute, Stephen. He called <a href="12515a.htm">provincial councils</a> at Saragossa (599) and Barcelona. Eusebius (610-32) held the council of Egara (Tarrasa) to enforce the canons of the Council of <a href="07513a.htm">Huesca</a>. Audax (633-38) was present at the Fourth Council of Toledo, and Protasius (637-46) at the Sixth and Seventh. Cyprianus (680-88) sent representatives to the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth councils of Toledo, and Vera assisted personally at the Sixteenth and Seventeenth.</p>

<p>In his <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> or in that of his successor, George, the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> invasion took place. Ludovico Pio appears to have temporarily taken possession of the city. A portion of its territroy was bestowed on the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, and the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank was given to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Narbonne, but was recovered in 759. Caesarius endeavoured to obtain recognition as titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarragona, but was not successful, although he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a> and Galicia, and obtained from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> of Santa Cecilia, which belonged to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarragona. Borrell, Count of Barcelona, induced <a href="08427a.htm">Pope John XIII</a> to confer the title of <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarragona on bishop Atton of <a href="15405a.htm">Vich</a>, although he never was called <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarragona but of Ausona. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15405a.htm">Vich</a>, Berengarius of Rosanes, petitioned <a href="15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a> for permission to promote a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> for the reconquest of Tarragona. Count Berenguer Ram&oacute;n II (the Fratricide) succeeded in taking the city and made it a fief of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, in recognition of the efforts of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15405a.htm">Vich</a>, conferred on him the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarragona, transferring to him all <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> to the city and its <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> which had previously belonged to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, was to remain in possession of the Church of <a href="15405a.htm">Vich</a>. A similar concession was granted to St. Olegarius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, who was permitted to retain possession of his former Church until he had obtained complete and peaceful possession of that of Tarragona, of which he had been named <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It was not until 1116 that Tarragona was definitively reconquered by Ram&oacute;n Berenguer III (the Great). Bishop Berenguer had died in 1110, after having assisted, in 1096, at the Council of <a href="11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a> convoked by <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a>. His successor in the <a href="05001a.htm">See</a> of Tarragona, St. Olegarius, had been a canon regular at Sts. Rufus in Provence, later an <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and then <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>. To him is due the restoration of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> authority of Tarragona. In 1117 Count Ram&oacute;n Berenguer III conferred on him the government of the city that he might endeavour to recolonize it, which work he carried on with great <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He assisted at the councils of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1109), of the Lateran (1123), and of <a href="04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (1130), and accompanied the Count of Barcelona as <a href="09118a.htm">pontifical legate</a> in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> which terminated in the imposition of a tribute upon <a href="14785a.htm">Tortosa</a> and <a href="09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>. The Norman Robert Burdet also joined the forces of the Count of Barcelona, established himself in Tarragona and obtained dominion over a great part of the city. The consequent dissensions among his sons led to the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> by them of Archbishop Hugo de Cervell&oacute;n 22 April, 1171.</p>

<p>On the death of St. Olegarius (6 March, 1137), Gregory, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cuxana, <a href="01641a.htm">succeeded</a> him in the <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> <a href="05001a.htm">See</a> of Tarragona, and was the first incumbent of that <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> to receive the title of <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The dissensions between the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and the kings, on account of the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Tarragona granted to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had begun its resettlement, continued during the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of Alfonso II, who bestowed the city as a dowry on his wife, Do&ntilde;a Sancha, and of Pedro IV (the Ceremonious), who, after forcibly seizing the dominions of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, repented in his last illness and restored to St. Tecla, <a href="11562a.htm">patroness</a> of the city, all that he had <a href="08010c.htm">unjustly</a> acquired.</p>

<p>By special <a href="12436b.htm">privilege</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, all the kings of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> were <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> at Saragossa by the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Tarragona, until the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Saragossa was re-established. When Jaime I, a child of six years, took the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarragona, Don Aspargo Barca, carried him in his arms. Although he was far advanced in his years, he wished to accompany the king in his expedition to conquer Majorca, and when Don Jaime refused his <a href="04283a.htm">consent</a>, he contributed a thousand marks in gold and twelve hundred armed men.</p>

<p>In 1242 a <a href="12515a.htm">provincial council</a> was convoked at Tarragona to regulate the procedure of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> and canonical penances. In 1312 a <a href="12515a.htm">provincial council</a> was assembled in the <a href="04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> <a href="03574b.htm">Chapel</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a>, to pass <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> on the <a href="14493a.htm">Templars</a>, whom it declared innocent.</p>

<p>Don Pedro Zagarriga, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarragona, was one of the arbitrators at Caspe. One of the most celebrated <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of Tarragona, Don Antonio Agustin (d. 1586), a native of Saragossa, was an eminent jurisconsult and <a href="11152a.htm">numismatist</a>. He put an end to the struggles referred to in "Don Quixote", between the Narros and Cadells factions, which had disturbed the peace of <a href="03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, it is <a href="02408b.htm">believed</a>, was begun by St. Olegarius. The edifice is solid and elegant, combining the Romanesque, Arabic, and <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic</a> styles of <a href="06665b.htm">architecture</a>, producing a very original and unique effect. Its <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is composed of three sections, and the ground plan, in the form of a Latin cross, has three <a href="10724a.htm">naves</a> and a wide <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a>. In the right <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> is the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Tecla, <a href="11562a.htm">patroness</a> of the city, begun in 1760 under the direction of Don Jos&eacute; Prats and finished in 1776. The <a href="02274a.htm">baptismal font</a> is a magnificent marble basin found in the ruins of the palace of <a href="02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. The <a href="03584a.htm">chapter house</a>, celebrated for the councils held there, has a Byzantine door and a notable <a href="05100b.htm">dome</a>. As late as the fifteenth century the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> had not yet been completed, as the <a href="13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, Pedro Juan, did not begin work on the main <a href="01362a.htm">altar</a> until 1426. The choir was not finished until 1493. The <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, the <a href="11297a.htm">organ</a>, built by the cura of Tivisa, Don Jaime Amig&oacute;, the <a href="14241a.htm">stained glass</a>, etc. date from the sixteenth century. Among the buildings worthy of mention are the Churches of San Pablo and Santa Tecla, the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, near the walls, that of Santa Teresa, and the church of the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the port. The former <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Francisco has been converted into government offices and a secondary <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> turned into barracks, their church, however, having been restored to them. The <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> is now the town hall, and the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a> and <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> turned over to military uses. The <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace is situated on the site of the ancient capitol, one tower of which still remains. The palace was rebuilt by Don Romualdo Mon y Valarde (1815-19). Near the sea, in the Roman amphitheatre, is the edifice called <em>el Milagro</em> (the Miracle), which belonged to the <a href="14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a>. It was afterwards used by the <a href="15045d.htm">Trinitarian Fathers</a>, and has since been converted into a penitentiary. The remains of many Roman buildings are to be found at Tarragona; the walls, the capitol, or citadel, the forum, the palace of <a href="02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, called the house of <a href="12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, the circus or amphitheatre, the aqueduct, known as the Puente del Diablo, the so-called tower, or sepulchre, of the Scipios, the <a href="01688a.htm">arch</a> of Sura, or of Bara, and the Aurelian Way. There is also a good archaeological museum.</p>

<p>The conciliar <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of San Pablo and Santa Tecla was founded in 1570 by the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Gaspar de Cervantes, and was the first to comply with the <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. In 1858 Archbishop Costa y Borras built a fourth wing. Benito Villamitjana built a new <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> behind the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1886, in the courtyard of which stands the old <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of San Pablo. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> raised this to the rank of a pontifical <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. In the district of Montblanc, in this <a href="01694b.htm">archdiocese</a>, is the ancient <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Poblet, founded in 1151 by Ram&oacute;n Berenguer IV, which was the pantheon of the kings of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>.</p>
