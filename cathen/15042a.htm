<p>(TREVIRENSIS)</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; suffragan of Cologne; includes in the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province of the Rhine the governmental department of Trier, with the exception of two districts administered by mayors, and the governmental department of Coblenz with the exception of ten such districts that belong to the <a href="04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>; it also includes the Principality of Birkenfeld belonging to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg (see map to article <a href="06484b.htm">GERMANY</a>). The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 46 deaneries, each administered by a dean and a definitor. In 1911 it comprised 750 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 28 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> administered by vicars, 200 chaplaincies and similar offices, 70 administrative and <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> offices. In 1912 there were 711 <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 28 <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> vicars, 210 <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and <a href="04570a.htm">curates</a>, 122 <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in other positions (administration and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>), 65 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> either retired or on leave of absence, 105 <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> belonging to the orders, 1,249,700 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 450,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of other faiths. In most of the country districts the population is nearly entirely <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; in the mining and manufacturing districts on the Saar, as well as on the Hunsr&uuml;ck and in the valley of the Nahe River, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> is not so predominant. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to elect the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; besides the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> there is also an <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>. The chapter consists of a <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a>, a dean (the <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>), 8 <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, 4 honorary canons; 6 <a href="04570a.htm">curates</a> are also attached to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> for the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> are the episcopal seminar for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> at Trier, which has a regent, 7 <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> professors, and 220 students, and the gymnasial <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for boys at Trier and Pr m.</p>

<p>Since the close of the <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders have prospered greatly, and in 1911 there were in the diocese: a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey at <a href="09658a.htm">Maria-Laach</a> containing 26 fathers, 80 brothers; a <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Apollinarisberg at Reimagen, 9 fathers, 8 brothers; 2 houses of the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, 18 fathers, 12 brothers; 1 house of the Oblates, 5 fathers, 21 brothers; 2 houses of the <a href="12107a.htm">Pallotines</a>, 9 fathers, 24 brothers; 1 house of the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, 9 fathers, 8 brothers; 1 house of the <a href="15613d.htm">White Fathers</a>, 5 fathers, 5 brothers; 1 house of the <a href="05054a.htm">Fathers of the Divine Word</a>, 21 fathers, 50 brothers; 126 Brothers of Charity in 4 houses, and 144 Brothers of St. Francis in 7 houses. The <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> orders and congregations in the diocese in 1911 were: <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Nuns of the Perpetual Adoration, 1 house with 37 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; <a href="10201a.htm">Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo</a>, 71 houses with 500 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Servants of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, 4 houses, 41 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Serving-Maids of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, 30 houses, 193 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Nuns, 2 houses, 69 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Sisters of St. Francis from the mother-houses at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, Heithuizen, Olpe, and Waldbreitbach, 94 houses, 476 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Nuns, 1 house, 10 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Sisters of St. Clement, 1 house, 6 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Nuns of the Visitation, 1 house, 50 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Sisters of the Holy Spirit, 47 houses, 300 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; Sisters of the Love of the Good Shepherd, 2 houses, 125 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; <a href="12251a.htm">Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus</a>, 1 house, 9 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, 1 house, 20 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns, 5 houses, 220 Sisters; Sisters of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, 7 houses; 30 sisters. The most important church of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the oldest church of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> on German soil. The oldest section of the building goes back to the Roman era and was a church as early as the fourth century. In the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> other parts were added which belong to all forms of architecture, although the Romanesque style preponderates. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> contains the remains of twenty-five <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and electors as well as those of the last four <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Trier. The most precious of its numerous treasures is the Holy Coat of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which, according to legend, was given to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Trier by St. Helena. Two exhibitions of this venerable <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> are worthy of special note: that of 1844, connected with the rise of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the one held in 1891, which attracted over two million <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. Other noted churches in Trier are: the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady, one of the most beautiful <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> monuments of <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>, built 1227-43; the Church of St. Paulinus or of the Martyrs, the burial place of Bishop Paulinus, erected in 1734 in <a href="03298b.htm">Rococo style</a> to replace the old church destroyed by the French in 1674; the thirteenth-century Romanesque church of the former <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of St. Matthias, containing the grave of St. Matthias, the only grave of an Apostle in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; it is much visited by <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. Other noted churches of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: the churches of St. Castor and Our Lady at Coblenz, the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> church of <a href="09658a.htm">Maria-Laach</a>, the old <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> churches of Pr&uuml;m, M&uuml;nstermaifeld, and Merzig; the Church of St. Maria at Oberwesel, the <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> of Andernach, Boppard, Remagen, Sinzig, and of other places on the Rhine and the Moselle.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The beginnings of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> of Trier are obscure. From the time of <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> reorganization of the divisions of the empire, Trier was the capital of Belgica Prima, the chief city of Gaul, and frequently the residence of the emperors. There were <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> among its population as early as the second century, and there was probably as early as the third century a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Trier, which is the oldest <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The first clearly authenticated <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Agricius who took part in the <a href="01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> in 314. His immediate successors were <a href="10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a> who sheltered the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> at Trier, and St. Paulinus, who was exiled to Phrygia on account of his opposition to <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Little is known of the later <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> up to the reign of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; during this intervening period the most important ones were <a href="11053a.htm">St. Nicetius</a> (527-66) and Magnericus (d. 596), the confidant of the Merovingian king, Childebert II. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> during the reign of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> were: Wiomad (757-91), who accompanied the emperor on his campaign against the Avars; Richbod (792-804), one of <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> pupils; and Amalarius Fortunatus (809-14), sent by <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> as ambassador to Constantinople, and the author of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> writings. <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> will proves that Trier at this era was an archdiocese; Metz, Toul, and Verdun are mentioned as its suffragans. In 772 <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> granted Wiomad complete immunity from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ruling count for all the churches, <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, villages, and castles belonging to the Church of St. Peter at Trier. In 816 Louis the Pious confirmed to Archbishop Hetti (814-47) the privileges of protection and immunity granted by his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>. At the partition of the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> empire at <a href="15350c.htm">Verdun</a> in 843, Trier fell to Lothair's empire; at the partition of Lothair's empire at Mersen in 870, it fell to the East-Frankish kingdom which later became the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. However, after the death of Louis the Child, the lords of <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> separated from the East-Frankish Kingdom and became vassals of the West-Frankish ruler King Charles the Simple, until Henry I conquered the country for <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> again. Archbishop Ratbod (883-915) received in 898 complete immunity from all state taxes for the entire episcopal territory from the King of Lorraine and <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, Swentibold, son of Emperor Arnulf. He obtained from Louis the Child the district and city of Trier, the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to have a mint and to impose customs-duties; from Charles the Simple he gained the right of a free election of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Trier. In this way the secular possessions of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Trier, which had sprung from the valuable donations of the Merovingian and <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> rulers, were raised to a secular principality. Archbishop Ratbert (931-56), brother-in-law of King Henry I, was confirmed by <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a> in all the temporal <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> gained by his predecessors.</p>

<p>Archbishop Poppo (1016-47), son of Margrave Leopold of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, did much to enlarge the territory owned by the church of Trier. During the strife over Investiture, Engelbert of Ortenburg (1078-1101) and Bruno of Laufen (1102-24) belonged to the imperial party. <a href="01259c.htm">Albero of Montreuil</a> (1131-52) had, as <a href="01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, opposed lay Investiture; during his administration the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of Trier reached its highest fame. From about 1100 the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Trier was the Arch-Chancellor of Gaul, for the German emperor, and thus became the possessor of an imperial office and an Elector of the German king and emperor. As the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Trier were among the leading spiritual princes of the empire, they became involved in all the struggles between <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor. While Hillin (1152-69) was a partisan of <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, Arnold I (1169-83) made successful efforts to bring about a reconciliation between the emperor and <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (1177). John I (1190-1212) was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> on account of his adherence to King Philip of Swabia; Bishop John increased the possessions of the archdiocese by gaining several countships and castles. Theodoric II of Wied (1212-42) belonged to the party of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, while Arnold II of Isenburg (1242-59) opposed the emperor. Henry II of Vinstingen (1260-86) was the first <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Trier who took part in the election of a German emperor as one of the seven Electors; the electoral dignity, together with the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to the first vote, was confirmed by the Golden <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> in 1356. As in other German <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, so also in Trier, the rising cities, especially Trier and Coblenz, sought to rid themselves of the suzerainty of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Such attempts were <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> with considerable success during the rule of Archbishop Diether of Nassau (1300-07), brother of King Adolph of Nassau. On the other hand, Baldwin of Luxembourg (1308-54), the most noted of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Trier, was able to restore and raise the importance of the See of Trier by his wide-reaching activity both in secular and spiritual affairs. He brought the cities of Coblenz and Trier under his suzerainty again, and was the actual organizer of his possessions as an electoral state. Werner of Falkenstein (1388-1418), one of Baldwin's successors, acquired Limburg on the Lahn; during the great <a href="13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> he held loyally to <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>. After the death of Otto of Ziegenhain (1418-30), who laboured <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the reform of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, there was a double election; upon this <a href="09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a> appointed a third <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. During the struggle of the candidates to secure the diocese it suffered severely. James of Sierck (1439-56) sought to restore order in the confused finances of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was deposed by <a href="05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> as an adherent of the Council of Basle and of the <a href="06031b.htm">Antipope Felix V</a>, who was elected there. However, the deposition had no effect as the German Electors opposed it. John II, Margrave of Baden (1456-1503), promoted the reform of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He left the diocese heavily in <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>, and these <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> were increased by his great-nephew and successor, James II of Baden (1503-11).</p>

<p>The <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> limited the <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> of the Archdiocese of Trier. Although the energetic Richard von Greiffenklau (1511-31) vigorously opposed the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, still he could not prevent the new <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from gaining a foothold in the district of the Hunsruck, and in that on the right bank of the Rhine. He defeated the attacks of Franz von Sickingen upon the city of Trier, as well as the efforts of that city to become independent of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1512 he exhibited the Holy Coat for the first time and spent the donations of the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> on the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. John II von Metzenhausen (1531-40) attempted reforms which were frustrated by his death. John II von Hagen (1541-47) sent a representative to the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and began earnest measures of reform. John V von Isenburg (1547-56) attended the council himself, but was recalled home by the incursion of Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach into the archdiocese, which the margrave devastated horribly. John VI von der Leyen (1556-67) was able to regain Trier, but could not prevent the French from taking possession of his three suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, and <a href="15350c.htm">Verdun</a>. He checked the further spread of the new doctrines by calling the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> into his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> (1561). James III von Eltz (1567-81) and John VII von Sch&ouml;nenberg (1581-99) carried out in their possessions the reformatory decrees of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The former secured the administration of the Abbey of Pr&uuml;m, whereby the secular possessions of the archdiocese reached their final extent; the latter established two <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> at Coblenz and Trier. Lothair von Metternich (1599-1623) joined the Catholic League in order to secure the stability of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In this way his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> became involved in the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>. His successor, Philip Christopher von Stern (1623-52), withdrew from the League, formed an alliance with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and permitted the French to garrison the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein. When he made advances to the Swedes he was captured by the Spanish troops in 1635 under suspicion of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and was kept a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> until 1645. In the struggle between the imperial troops and the French the archdiocese was often devastated. Charles Caspar von der Leyen (1652-76) had scarcely repaired the damage done by the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> by an excellent administration, when the marauding <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV of France</a> brought fresh misery upon the country. John Hugo von Orsbeck (1676-1711) refused to recognize the seizure of some of his territories and their incorporation into <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> through what was called the "reunions", neither would take the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of loyalty to <a href="09371a.htm">Louis</a>. Consequently, during the years 1684-97 large parts of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> were garrisoned by French troops.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>During the long period of peace in the eighteenth century the archdiocese had excellent rulers. Francis Louis von Pfalz-Neuburg (1716-29) gave particular attention to the organization of the administration of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, and raised the decaying <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> by establishing new professorships. Francis George von Sch&ouml;nborn (1729-56) encouraged learned studies and founded a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> and building. The short administration of John Philip von Walderdorf (1756-68) was followed by the reign of the last Elector of Trier, Clement Wenceslaus, Duke of Saxony (1768-1812), who was also <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. He gained a reputation by improving the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and reforming the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but, on the other hand, influenced by the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the "Enlightenment", he supported <a href="06023a.htm">Febronianism</a>, shared in the labours of the Congress of Ems, and also was involved in the dispute about the nunciatures (see <a href="11160a.htm">NUNCIO</a>). After the outbreak of the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the territories of Trier, especially Coblenz, became the gathering place of the French <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s.</em> In 1794 Trier and Coblenz were besieged by the French. In 1797, by the Peace of Campo-Formio, the part of the archdiocese on the left bank of the Rhine was ceded to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; in 1797 the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was suppressed. In 1801 the Peace of Lun&eacute;ville gave to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, in addition, the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein. When the German Church was secularized in 1803, the section of the archdiocese on the right bank of the Rhine was also secularized and the greater part of it was incorporated into Nassau. Clemens Wenceslaus renounced his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> in return for an annual pension of 100,000 gulden and withdrew to the <a href="02073b.htm">Diocese of Augsburg</a>. An <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration, which lasted until 1824, was established in Ehrenbreitstein for the part of the former archdiocese on the right bank of the Rhine. The <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> Diocese of Trier was established in 1801 for the section of the former archdiocese which had been ceded to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. It embraced hardly a third of the old diocese and was made suffragan to <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. Its first and only <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Charles Mannay (1802-16). The Congress of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> gave the territory included in this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> once more to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, largely to <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. In 1816 Bishop Charles Mannay resigned his office and retired to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, where he died in 1824 as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12771b.htm">Rennes</a>. For six years the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a>, the administration being conducted in the interim by Hubert Anthony Corden as <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, from 1818 as <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. On the reorganization of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in 1821, Trier was revived as a simple diocese by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De salute animarum", made suffragan to <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and received about its present territory. In 1824 it contained 531 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 580,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<p>The first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was Joseph von Hommer (1824-36). The election of his successor, William Arnoldi (1842-64) which took place in 1839 and was renewed in 1842, was not recognized by the Government until Frederick William IV ascended the throne. Arnoldi did a great deal for the reawakening of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> consciousness in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The exhibition of the Holy Coat, which he brought about in 1844, led to the forming of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> called German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. He was succeeded by Leopold Pelldram (1865-67), formerly <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> general of the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> army, who was followed by Matthias Eberhard (1867-76), who enjoys the honours of a Confessor of the Faith. Eberhard was one of the first to suffer by the <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> which broke out in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. After being repeatedly condemned to pay heavy fines he was sentenced on 6 March, 1876, to ten months <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. Trier was one of the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> that suffered the most during the <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>. The number of its <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> robbed of their <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> amount to 197, while nearly 294,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> lacked regular spiritual care. After the death of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> on 30 May, 1876, the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was vacant for five years and had to be secretly administered by an <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>. Finally in 1881, through the personal efforts of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, an agreement was made with the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government, and Mich l Felix Korum (<a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canon and <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the minster at <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>) was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Trier by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 19 August, and <a href="05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on 25 September. Up to the present day the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has sought to repair the damage inflicted upon his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, through the confessional, the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, and religious associational life. He has founded religious institutions for <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and promoted the establishment of numerous houses of the orders. The exhibition of the Holy Coat in 1891 which he carried out was the occasion for impressive demonstrations of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and life in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> (cf. Korum, "Wunder und Gnadenerweise, die sich bei der Austellung 1891 zugetragen haben", Trier, 1894).</p>
