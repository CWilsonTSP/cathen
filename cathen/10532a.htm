<p>DIOCESE OF MONTEREY AND LOS ANGELES (MONTEREYENSIS ET ANGELORUM).</p>

<p>Comprises that part of the <a href="03170a.htm">State of California</a> which lies south of 37 deg. 5 min. N. lat. and covers an area of 80,000 square miles. It thus embraces eighteen of the twenty-one Indian missions which made <a href="03170a.htm">California</a> famous. Originally the whole state with the peninsula of Lower California formed the Diocese of Both Californias whose first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the Rt. Rev. Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno. On his arrival in Upper <a href="03170a.htm">California</a> he established his residence at Santa Barbara Mission. On 1 May, 1850, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> organized the Diocese of Monterey and named <a href="01282a.htm">Rt. Rev. Joseph Sadoc Alemany, O.P.</a>, its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but Lower California was not withdrawn from his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> until 21 Dec., 1851. In 1853 the peninsula was placed under the administration of the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Mexico. When on 29 July, 1853, the Archdiocese of San Francisco was erected, the boundaries of the Monterey Diocese were drawn, as they exist at present. <a href="01282a.htm">Archbishop Alemany</a> on 29 July, 1853, was promoted to the <a href="13439c.htm">See of San Francisco</a>, and on the same <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> <a href="01380e.htm">Rt. Rev. Thaddeus Amat, C.M.</a>, was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Monterey. The new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> resided at Santa Barbara, however, until 9 July, 1859, on which date the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> permitted him to remove his residence to Los Angeles, but with instructions to retain the old title.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Around the former missions and the four military garrisons in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> immigrants from almost every part of the world took up their abode and founded cities, but the names of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> under whose invocation the Indian missions had been established were retained, and thus it is that so many of the towns, rivers, and mountains still bear the names of various <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. The most noted among the early missionaries were the holy and energetic <a href="13730b.htm">Fr. Junipero Serra</a>, the founder of the missions; <a href="11434a.htm">Fr. Francisco Palou</a>, his biographer and the historian of the early missionary period; Fr. Fermin de Lasuen, the wise and firm successor of <a href="13730b.htm">Fr. Serra</a>; Fr. Luis Jayme, the first <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>; Fr. Juan Crespi, one of the discoverers of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> and Monterey Bays and author of a lengthy description of the expedition; <a href="14030b.htm">Fr. Buenaventura Sitjar</a>, author of a dictionary of the Telame language (New York, 1861); Fr. Geronimo Boscana, author of "Chinigchinig," an account of the Indian character and customs (New York, 1846); Fr. Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta, author of a dictionary of 2884 words and expressions in the Mutsun language (New York, 1862); Fr. Vincente de Sarri&aacute;, first <em>comisario-prefecto</em> and eminent for learning and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>; <a href="11595b.htm">Fr. Mariano Payeras</a>, author of an Indian <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a>; Fr. Narciso Duran; <a href="09530a.htm">Fr. Magin Catal&aacute;</a>. <a href="05190a.htm">Fr. Francisco Dumetz</a>; Fr. Jos&eacute; <a href="13713b.htm">Se&ntilde;an</a>; <a href="14450a.htm">Fr. Est&eacute;van Tapis;</a> and Fr. Jos&eacute; Maria Gonzalez R&uacute;bio, administrator of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> after Bishop Diego's death. The first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of both Californias, Rt. Rev. Francisco Garc&iacute;a Diego y Moreno, O.F.M., was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 4 October, 1840, and died 30 April, 1846, at Santa Barbara Mission, where his remains were <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> on the Epistle side of the altar. During his administration the first <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> on the western coast was opened, 4 May, 1844, at Mission Santa Inez; Fr. Jos&eacute; Joaquin Jimeno, O.F.M., was the first <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. Very Rev. Jos&eacute; Maria Gonzalez R&uacute;bio, O.F.M., was administrator from 1846 to 1851 when <a href="01282a.htm">Bishop Alemany</a> arrived. Fr. R&uacute;bio was later proposed for a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> but declined the <a href="10404a.htm">mitre</a>. While in charge of the See of Monterey, which included both Californias, he enjoyed the privilege of administering the sacrament of Confirmation. Unable to procure <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to replace the old missionaries who were fast dying away, Fr. R&uacute;bio in 1849 invited the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> to come to <a href="03170a.htm">California</a> and found a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> in the territory. They consented and opened their college in 1851. He was born at <a href="07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, Mexico, in 1804, and entered the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> at Zap&oacute;pan in 1824. In 1833 he arrived in <a href="03170a.htm">California</a> and was given charge of Mission San Jos&eacute;. In 1842, at the request of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he removed to Santa Barbara, and lived there continuously until his death, 2 November, 1875. His remains were buried in the vaults of the mission church.</p>

<p><a href="01380e.htm">Rt. Rev. Thaddeus Amat, C.M.</a>, after his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 12 March, 1854, reached <a href="03170a.htm">California</a> in 1855. In 1856 he called the Sisters of Charity (Vincentians) to the diocese. They founded and still conduct the <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> at Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz, and an academy at Hollister. He also brought the <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> or <a href="10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> Fathers to Los Angeles where they erected St. Vincent's College. At his request the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary came from <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> to <a href="03170a.htm">California</a>, 30 August, 1871, and opened <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls at Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, and San Bernardino. In 1871 <a href="01380e.htm">Bishop Amat</a> laid the cornerstone for the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Los Angeles, and placed it and the diocese under the patronage of St. Vibiana (Bibiana), virgin and <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>. The building was completed and dedicated, 30 June, 1876. In 1870 he attended the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. Owing to constant ill-health he asked for a coadjutor who was given him in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of Rt. Rev. Francis Mora. <a href="01380e.htm">Bishop Amat</a> died, 12 May, 1878. His remains lie buried in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which he erected.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Rt. Rev. Francis Mora was born at <a href="15405a.htm">Vich</a>, <a href="03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 25 Nov., 1827; he attended the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of his native city; in 1855 he accompanied <a href="01380e.htm">Bishop Amat</a> to <a href="03170a.htm">California</a>, and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at Santa Barbara, 19 March, 1856. From July of that year to the end of 1860 he was stationed at the Indian mission of San Juan Bautista, and from September, 1861, to July, 1866, he had charge of Mission San Luis Obispo. After that he resided at Los Angeles. On 20 May, 1873, Father Mora was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10600b.htm">Mosynopolis</a> <em><a href="08025a.htm">in partibus infidelium</a></em> and made coadjutor of <a href="01380e.htm">Bishop Amat</a>. At the death of the latter he succeeded to the See of Monterey and Los Angeles. In 1894 he asked for a coadjutor, who was appointed in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of Rt. Rev. George Montgomery. On 1 February, 1896, Bishop Mora resigned, and when <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 20 June, accepted his resignation he returned to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He died at Sarria, <a href="03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, 3 August, 1905. During his administration the <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> and of <a href="12354c.htm">St. Dominic</a> were invited into the diocese to open <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. Bishop Mora was remarkable for his financial ability, and succeeded in paying off many of the important <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and by his careful investments left it in a splendid financial condition.</p>

<p>Rt. Rev. George Montgomery was born in Daviess County, <a href="08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, 30 December, 1847, and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 20 December, 1879. He held the post of Chancellor of the Archdiocese of San Francisco until his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tumi, 8 April, 1894, when he became coadjutor to Bishop Mora. Two years later he succeeded to the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> and at once displayed remarkable energy. At this period immigrants from the eastern States began to flock to southern <a href="03170a.htm">California</a> in great numbers. Los Angeles more than doubled its population. New needs arose which it was the endeavour of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to meet by building churches and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and by calling to his aid more <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious. In season and out of season Bishop Montgomery insisted on the necessity of <a href="05295b.htm">educating</a> children in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. It was his fearless attitude which compelled the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to recognize the right of Indian <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> and guardians to send their children to the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of their choice independent of the reservation agent. Subsequently this same view was adopted by the Government, and made the rule for all the Indians in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> thus in every way manifested a watchful solicitude for the spiritual and temporal welfare of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. His <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> won friends for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on all sides, whilst his vigorous defence of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, as well as his clean-cut, outspoken advocacy of American <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, gave to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in southern <a href="03170a.htm">California</a> a great onward movement and prepared the way for Bishop Conaty's administration. In 1903 Bishop Montgomery was appointed <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Osino <em><a href="08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em> and made coadjutor to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>. He died, 10 January, 1907, sincerely lamented by all classes, especially by the poor. During his administration the following congregations of religious were received into the diocese: <a href="08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, <a href="07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>, Sisters of the Holy Names, Sisters of Notre Dame, Sisters of the Presentation, and the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline Sisters</a>.</p>

<p>Rt. Rev. Thomas James Conaty was born in Kilnaleck, County Cavan, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1 August, 1847, and came to America with his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> in 1850. He attended the home <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of Taunton, <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, graduated from Holy Cross College, Worcester, <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, in 1869, was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at Montreal Seminary, 21 December, 1872, was made assistant at St. John's Church, Worcester, <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 1 January, 1873, and <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church of the Sacred Heart, Worcester, 10 January, 1880. During these years he was actively engaged in the cause of total abstinence and <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. He was president of the Total Abstinence Union of America, and for several years president of the <a href="14334a.htm">Catholic Summer School</a> at Cliff Haven. At different times he was elected to public positions of trust in the city of Worcester. On 10 January, 1897, he was appointed Rector of the Catholic University, Washington, D.C., by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. On 1 November, 1897, he was made domestic <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, and 14 July, 1901, named <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13421c.htm">Samos</a>, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 21 November, 1901, by Cardinal Gibbons. On 27 March, 1903, he was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Monterey and Los Angeles to succeed Bishop Montgomery. The influx of immigrants from the East, especially into the city of Los Angeles, has been phenomenal. From his arrival in the latter part of 1903 to the latter part of 1910 twelve new <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> have been added to the episcopal city, and nine <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> have been erected in various parts of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> for 2500 additional pupils. The number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> has increased from 101 in 1903 to 206 in 1910, 73 of whom belong to eight different <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The character of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population numbering 100,000, of whom 60,000 live in Los Angeles, is cosmopolitan. The percentage of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to the inhabitants of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is about one-sixth. Beside the English-speaking races, there are large colonies of <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and Mexicans, <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>, Portuguese, Poles, Slavonians French, Basques, <a href="09292a.htm">Lithuanians</a>, and Syrians. Churches and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are caring for the Spiritual interests of these different nationalities. One feature of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> work is the care of the Indians, most of whom are descendants of the former Mission Indians. About 4000 are cared for by seven <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who devote themselves entirely or to a great extent to their spiritual needs, speaking to the young people in English and their elders in <a href="14192a.htm">Spanish</a> which is generally understood by the natives. Churches have been built for them at all reservations. A church and <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence have also been erected near the Government Indian School at Sherman, and a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> acts as <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children of that institution. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Bureau maintains a large boarding <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for Indian children at Banning which is in charge of the <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. As the diocese annually receives its share of the Pious Fund of Mexico, it has been able to provide for many of the religious necessities of the Indians, but there are many demands calling for <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> help. The rapidly growing population of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> impelled Bishop Conaty to call to his assistance the following additional <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations: <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a> for the Basques, Fathers of the Society of the Divine Saviour for the Poles, Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the Mexicans, <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a>, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, <a href="12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Heart (Italian), and Sisters of St. Francis.</p>
