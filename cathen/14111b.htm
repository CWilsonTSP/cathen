<p>An institution of religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, taking perpetual <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> and devoted to the work of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, founded 21 November, 1800, by <a href="02283a.htm">Madeleine-Sophie Barat</a>. One of the signs of returning vigour in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> after 1792 was the revival of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Religious orders had been suppressed by the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of 18 August, 1792, but within a few years a reaction set in; the restoration of some orders and the foundations of new congregations ushered in "the second spring". One of the first was the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Under the provisional title of "Fathers of the Sacred Heart" and "Fathers of the Faith", some devoted <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> banded themselves together and in due time returned from their exile or emigration to devote themselves to the spiritual welfare of their country. Father L&eacute;onor De Tourn&eacute;ly was among the founders of the Fathers of the Sacred Heart, and the first to whom it occurred that an institute of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> bearing the same name and devoting themselves to the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of girls, would be one of the most efficacious means of restoring the practice of religion in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Though many difficulties intervened, two attempts were made. Princess Louise de Bourbon Cond&eacute; before the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, and the Archduchess Mary Anne of Austria both tried to form an institute according to his <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>; but neither succeeded, and he died before anything could be accomplished. He had confided his views to Father Varin who succeeded him as superior of the Fathers of the Sacred Heart. A short time afterwards Father Varin found in <a href="02283a.htm">Madeleine-Sophie Barat</a>, sister of Father Louis Barat, the instrument to execute his plans. The first members of the new <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> began their community life in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, under the guidance of Father Varin. The first <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was opened at <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a> in 1801, under Mademoiselle Loquet. A <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> which had already existed there was made over to the new institute, and some who had worked in it offered themselves as <a href="12319b.htm">postulants</a> for the "Dames de la Foi" or "De L'Instruction Chr&eacute;tienne", the name which the new <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> had assumed, as that of the "Society of the Sacred Heart", might be supposed to indicate a connection with the royalist party of La Vend&eacute;e. As Mlle. Loquet, who had been acting as superior, lacked the requisite qualities, by the advice of Father Varin and with the assent of the community <a href="02283a.htm">Sophie Barat</a> was named superior. By <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and temperament, the new superior was especially fitted for the work of foundation. In 1804 a second house was opened and a new member, Phillippine Duchesne, received, who was destined to carry the work of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> beyond the limits of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Formerly a <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> of the Visitation <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at Ste. Marie d'en Haut, near <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, Mlle. Duchesne found it impossible to reconstruct the <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the Visitation in the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> which she purchased after the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. Father Varin made her acquaintance and reported to <a href="02283a.htm">Mother Barat</a> that the house was offered to her, and that she could find there some who wished to join her.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The first plan of the institute was drawn up by Father Roger and Varin, and with a memorial composed by Mothers <a href="02283a.htm">Barat</a> and Duchesne was presented to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> and approved by him. This plan and memorial set forth the end of the association, which was the perfection of its members and the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; the spirit aimed at detachment from the world, purity of intention for the glory of the Sacred Heart, gentleness, <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and obedience; the means, for the religious, the training of the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and spiritual exercises, for others, boarding <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for the upper classes, free <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and spiritual retreats. The rule in this preliminary stage was simple; the houses were to be under one superior-general, everything was to be in common, the office of the Blessed Virgin was to be recited, the time appointed for <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> was specified. The manner of life was to be simple without the prescribed austerities of the older orders, which would be incompatible with the work of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. On <a href="02283a.htm">Mother Barat's</a> return to Amiens in 1806 the first general congregation was assembled for the election of the superior-general, and she was chosen for the office. Father Varin then withdrew form the position he had held as superior of the new institute which was now regularly constituted, but he continued for years to help the young superior-general with his advice and support. The first serious trouble which arose nearly wrecked the whole undertaking. At the end of 1809 the "Dames de la Foi" had six houses; Amiens, <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, Niort, <a href="06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, and Cuigniers. The first house at <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a> was governed at this time by Mother Baudemont, who fell under the influence of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="01429d.htm">Diocese of Amiens</a>, Abb&eacute; de St-Est&eacute;ve, who took that house under his control and even drew up a set of rules drawn from those of the monastic orders and entirely foreign to the spirit of Father Varin and the foundress. The devotion to the Sacred Heart which was to be its very life scarcely appeared in the new rules and they were in consequence not acceptable to any of the houses outside Amiens. Abb&eacute; de St-Est&eacute;ve was determined to force the matter. He went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and from thence sent orders, ostensibly from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The name of the Society of the Sacred Heart was to be abandoned for that of "Apostolines", and he wrote vehement letters condemning Father Varin and the superior-general and her work. The most important letter in the case proved to be a <a href="06135b.htm">forgery</a>. The institute recovered its balance, but the house at <a href="06542c.htm">Ghent</a> had been already lost to the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>.</p>

<p>The second general congregation (1815) examined the constitution which had been elaborated by Father Varin and <a href="02283a.htm">Mother Barat</a> (they were an expansion of the first plan presented to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>) and they were accepted by all the houses of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. It was decided to have a general <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The third general congregation (1820) drew up the first uniform plan of studies which had been developed and modified from time to time to bring it into harmony with present needs, without losing the features which have characterized it from the beginning. In 1826 the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> obtained the formal <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> and the first cardinal protector was appointed, in place of an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior whose authority would have depended too much upon local conditions. The sixth general congregation was anxious to bring the constitutions into close comformity with those of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. <a href="02283a.htm">Mother Barat</a> foresaw that the proposed changed were unsuitable for a congregation of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, but permitted an experimental trial of them for three years. Finally the whole affair was submitted to <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, who decided that the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> should return in all points to the constitution approved by <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>. The last changes in the constitutions were made in 1851 with the sanction of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Superiors-vicar were named to help the superior-general in the government of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> by taking the immediate supervision of a certain number of houses forming a vicariate. The superior-vicar assembled with the mother general and the assistants general, form the general congregation of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. In 1818 Mother Philippine Duchesne introduced the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> into the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and the first houses were founded in <a href="10398a.htm">Missouri</a> and Louisiana. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> under the guidance of <a href="07134b.htm">Mother Mary Aloysia Hardey</a> spread rapidly, and in 1910 counted twenty-seven houses and more than eleven hundred members. The extension in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> was confined to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> until 1827 when a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was opened at the Trinit&agrave; dei Monti, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Houses were founded in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (Jette), 1836; <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> (Berrymead, now Roehampton) and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (Roscrea), both in 1841; <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> (Montreal), 1842; <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> (Lemberg), 1843; <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Sarria, near Barcelona), 1846. Mother du Rousier was the pioneer in South America (Santiago de <a href="03660a.htm">Chile</a> in 1854). Other foundations were made in the West Indies (1858); New Zealand (1880); Australia (1882); <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (1903); <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> (1908). The Revolution of 1830 disturbed the house in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> but did not destroy it; the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was removed elsewhere. In 1848 the house in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> had to be abandoned; the religious were expelled from <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, Turim, <a href="13405c.htm">Saluzzo</a>, and Pignerol while the houses in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> were searched and pillaged. In 1860 Loreto, St. Elpidio, and <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a> were suppressed. The German houses were closed by the May Laws of 1873. Between 1903 and 1909 forty-seven houses in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> were closed and many of them confiscated by the French government. The mother-house was transferred to <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1909. This wholesale destruction increased the extension in foreign countries; for almost every house that has been closed another has been opened elsewhere. At present the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> counts 139 houses and about 6500 religious.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> aims at a twofold spirit--contemplative and active. It is composed of choir religious and lay sisters. enclosure is observed in a manner adapted to the works; the Office of the Blessed Virgin is recited in choir. The choice of subjects is guided by the qualifications laid down in the constitutions. In addition to the indication of a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="15498a.htm">religious vocation</a> there is required respectable parentage, unblemished reputation, a good or at least sufficient <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> with some aptitude for completing it, a sound judgment, and above all a generous determination to make an entire surrender of self to the service of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> through the hands of superiors. The candidate is not allowed to make any conditions as to place residence or employment, but must be ready to be sent by obedience to any part of the world, even the privilege of going on foreign missions is not definitely promised in the beginning to those who aspire to it. Postulants are admitted to a preliminary probation of three months, at the end of which they may take the religious habit and begin their <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of two years, which are spent in studying the spirit and the rules of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, exercising themselves in its manner of living, and in the virtues which they will be called upon to practice; the second year is devoted to a course of study which is to prepare them for their <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> work. To each <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> there is attached a teaching and training department where the first course of studies may be taken, and when it is possible the young religious pass a year in this, after their <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, before they are sent to teach in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The first <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, simple perpetual <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity and obedience, are taken at the end of two years of <a href="11144a.htm">noviceship</a>, after which follow five years spend in study, teaching, or other <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>. At the end of this period follows for those who have special aptitude for the work of teaching, another short course of study, and for all a period of second <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> or probation lasting six months, at the end of which, that is to say, seven years after their admission to the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, the aspirants take their final <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> and are received as professed religious. The <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability, that is, of perseverance in the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, is then added, and for the choir religious a <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> to <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> themselves to <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of youth; provision is made, however, that this <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> may be accomplished even if obedience should prescribe other <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> than those of direct teaching, and may be fulfilled by concurrence in any way in the work of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. The <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability binds the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> to the professed until death, as well as the professed to the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>; this bond can only be broken by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> is governed by a superior general, elected for life by the assistants general and superiors vicar. The assistants general are elected for six years, the superiors vicar and local superiors are nominated by the mother general, and may be changed at her discretion; their usual period of government is three years, but it may be prolonged or shortened according to circumstances. The superior general assembles the superiors vicar in a general congregation every six years, and with the help of the assistants general transacts with them all business connected with the general government of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. These periodical assemblies, the occasional visits of the superior general to the houses in different countries, the regular reports and accounts sent in from every vicariate, the free access of all to the mother general by writing, and in particular the organization of the house of last probation, which as far as possible brings the young religious for six months into touch with the first superiors of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>--all tend to unity. Its union is what is most valued, and if it had been possible to define it sufficiently it is said that a fourth <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of charity would have been added to the <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the members.</p>

<p>Four principal works give scope to the activities of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><em>Education of the upper classes in the boarding <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and of late years in day <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</em> Originally the plan of studies was more or less uniform in all the houses, but it has become <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to modify it according to the needs and <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> ideals of different countries and the kind of life for which the pupils have to be prepared. The character of the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the Sacred Heart, however, remains the same, based on the study of religious and of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy and laying particular stress on history, literature, essay-writing, modern languages, and such <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of household management as can be taught at <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>.</li><li><em>Free or <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</em> In some countries, as in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, these are aided by the State, and follow the regulations laid down for other public elementary <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>; in others they are <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and adapt their teaching to the needs and circumstances of the children. Between these two classes of <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> have arisen in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> secondary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, aided by the State, which are principally feeding <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for the two training colleges in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> and Newcastle, where <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers are prepared for the certificates entitling them to teach in elementary state-supported <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. This work is of wider importance than the teaching of single elementary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and is valued as a means of reaching indirectly a far greater number of children than those with whom the religious themselves can come into contact. It likewise leavens the teaching profession with minds trained in <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and practice. This work for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers also exists at <a href="09255a.htm">Lima</a> in a flourishing <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a>.</li><li>A work which is taking rapid development is that of <em>spiritual retreats for all classes of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>.</em> The spiritual exercises are given to considerable numbers of ladies who spend a few days within the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Sacred Heart; in other cases the exercises are adapted for poor girls and peasant <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. Retreats for First Communion in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and retreats for Indian <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> in Mexico are special varieties of this work.</li><li><em>The congregations of Children of Mary loving in the world</em> which have their own rules and organizations (see Children of Mary of the Sacred Heart, The).  </li></ul></div>
