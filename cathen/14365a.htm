<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF SYDNEY (SYDNEYENSIS).</p>

<p>The vast territories formerly known as New Holland and Van Dieman's Island and since 1900 as The Commonwealth of Australia were erected to the Vicariate Apostolic of New Holland in 1834. <a href="12201a.htm">John Bede Polding</a>, a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, was <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> on 29 June, 1834. <a href="12201a.htm">Dr. Polding</a> visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1841-2, and at his suggestion new sees were erected in <a href="07380c.htm">Hobart</a> and Adelaide. A few years later Melbourne and Brisbane were also detached from the archdiocese. In New South Wales <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were erected at <a href="09555b.htm">Maitland</a>, <a href="06683a.htm">Goulburn</a>, <a href="02349a.htm">Bathurst</a>, <a href="01740b.htm">Armidale</a>, <a href="09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, and Wilcannia; these form at present the suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, which was erected into an archdiocese on 15 February, 1842. The archdiocese stretches along the Pacific coast from the Red Head on the north to Cape Howe on the south, and inland to the Dividing Range. When <a href="12201a.htm">Dr. Polding</a> landed at Sydney there were only four <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the district; <a href="15121a.htm">Father Ullathorne</a>, an <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, who had come to Australia in 1833, was <a href="15402a.htm">vicar general</a>, assisted by Fathers Therry, McEnroe, and Dowling, three <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, the last-named a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>. The official census of 1833 gave the population of the colony as 60, 794, the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of all <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> being 43,095, and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 17, 283. The government allowance in the same year for the maintenance of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was $4000, whereas the <a href="01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, exclusive of its rich land endowments, was assigned the sum of $95,355. There were ten <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> receiving about $2000 from the Government, whilst the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were allowed $28,680, in addition to a grant of $16,500 for the building of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> King's School at Parramatta. In 1836, <a href="15121a.htm">Dr. Ullathorne</a> sailed for <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to secure <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> for the increasing demands of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He availed himself of this opportunity to publish a pamphlet setting forth the sad condition of the convicts, and the maladministration of affairs in official quarters. Seventy-five thousand copies of this pamphlet were circulated in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and throughout the Continent, and its effect was seen in the altered conditions of administration soon after introduced. His mission was successful, and in 1841 <a href="12201a.htm">Dr. Polding</a> was enabled to report to <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> that the diocese had 24 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, a community of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 9 churches completed and 6 others in the course of erection, with several small <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> and 31 <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>During a visit to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1846-47, <a href="12201a.htm">Dr. Polding</a> secured the appointment of Dr. Davis, O. S. B., <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="09555b.htm">Maitland</a>, as his co-adjutor <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He, however, died in Sydney in 1854. In 1873, <a href="15315a.htm">Archbishop Roger Bede Vaughan</a> was appointed co-adjutor, and he succeeded <a href="12201a.htm">Dr. Polding</a> on 16 March, 1877. He was remarkable for his eloquence, and upheld with great vigour the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause in the matter of religious <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. On 19 April, 1883, he sailed for <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> via San Francisco, but died two days after his arrival in Liverpool (18 August). Patrick Francis Moran (see below), <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11342b.htm">Ossory</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, was appointed to the vacant see, his <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 21 March, 1884. Dr. Higgins was appointed <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> in 1888, and in 1899 was translated to the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="13105c.htm">Rockhampton</a> in Queensland. Most Rev. Michael Kelly, titular <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Acrida, was appointed co-adjutor in 1901. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> under the invocation of Our Lady Help of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, begun as far back as 1820 by Father Therry and completed by <a href="12201a.htm">Archbishop Polding</a>, was destroyed by fire on 29 June, 1865. It was rebuilt according to plans by Wardell, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="15315a.htm">Archbishop Vaughan</a> on 8 September, 1882. Archbishop Moran landed at Sydney on 8 September, 1884. The following year he was summoned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be promoted to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. He convened at presided at three plenary <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> (1885, 1895, 1905), and also presided at the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congresses held in 1900, 1904, and 1909. Conferences of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> have been held every year. St. Patrick's Ecclesiastical College, for the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, was erected at Manly on a government grant of eighty acres; the foundations were blessed during the <a href="12164c.htm">plenary synod</a> of 1885, and dedicated in 1888. It was built and fully equipped at the sole expense of <a href="14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>, who wished it to be his gift to the Australian Church, as it was intended not for Sydney alone but for all the Australian <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. It has in the present year (1911), eighty students, all Australians, and has since its opening furnished one hundred and thirty <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to the Australian mission. A preparatory <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college at Springwood, in the Blue mountains, was opened last year. It is erected on a site of six hundred acres, the purchase of the land and the erection of the building being a further gift of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to the diocese. There are two <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly papers, "The Catholic Press" and "The Freeman's Journal"; there is also a quarterly "Australasian Catholic Record", besides, some minor month;ly publications. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Club, organized in 1810, has a considerable enrollment.</p>

<p>When the <a href="12201a.htm">Dr. Polding</a> was appointed <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, several <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> volunteered for the Australian Mission. Some years later, at <a href="12201a.htm">Dr. Polding's</a> petition, St. Mary's was declared a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the adjoining rectory was raised to the dignity of a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a>, and it was hoped by the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> that the whole diocese would be efficiently served by an Anglo-Australian <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> community. This, however, was soon found to be impracticable. From the first many difficulties beset the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> order in Sydney. The community was finally dissolved by <a href="15315a.htm">Archbishop Vaughan</a>, himself a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, and missions were assigned to the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the ranks of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men are at present represented by the <a href="09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a>, who entered on their missionary work in 1837, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, Vincencians, <a href="11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, Missionaries of the Divine Word, and <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. In 1883 the members of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders numbered 41; at present they are 79. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Congregation of the Sisters of Charity was the first of the orders of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> to arrive (1 January, 1839) in <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a>. For some years their special care was devoted to the <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> convicts. Later they engaged in the work of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, took charge of St. Vincent's Hospital, the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> in <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a>, and visited the <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a>. The congregation now numbers in Australia 320 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> (in Sydney 235). The <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Nuns arrived in Australia in 1849, and at their <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="14321a.htm">Subiaco</a> devote themselves to the higher branches of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. The Good <a href="13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, a purely Australia order instituted in Sydney in 1857, are spread through other diocese and number in Sydney 220. The <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> are also an Australian institute spread through several diocese, numbering in Sydney 255. Other <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> are the <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, Religious of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Poor Claires, <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Nursing <a href="14029a.htm">Sisters of the Little Company of Mary</a>, <a href="12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, Sisters of St. Brigid, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Nuns, <a href="08054a.htm">Institute of the Blessed Virgin of Loretto</a>, Sisters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, and <a href="09750b.htm">Marists</a>. At the close of <a href="15315a.htm">Archbishop Vaughan's</a> episcopate, the number of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was 252; at present (1911) they number 1400. St. John's College is associated with the Sydney University. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> have the flourishing College of St. Ignatius at Riverview, and the High School of St. Aloysius at Milson's point. The Marist Brothers have a <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> besides the College of St. Joseph, the High School at Darlinghurst, and several <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="03710b.htm">Christian Brothers from Ireland</a> were the first teaching <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order to come to Australia. Three brothers accompanied <a href="12201a.htm">Dr. Polding</a> to Sydney in 1843, and within a few months they had three <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>; sufficient means for their support were lacking and they returned to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1844. They returned to Sydney in 1877, and now have a <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, two flourishing high schools, and eight <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="11553a.htm">Patrician Brothers</a> have also a flourishing college and some <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.
