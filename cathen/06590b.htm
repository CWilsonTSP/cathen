<p><a href="01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in the <a href="12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. The archdiocese includes the Dioceses of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Posen, which were separate up to 1821. Since that time they have been united under one <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Besides these <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> also embraces the <a href="04566a.htm">Bishopric of Culm</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>The Bishopric of Posen (<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Posania</em>; Polish, <em>Poznan</em>) was founded in 968 under Miecystaw or Mesko, Duke of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Unable to cope with internal enemies, he sought the support of the German <a href="11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> and became one of his vassals. Converted by his <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> wife, Dubravka, daughter of Duke Boleslaw I of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, he was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and, in order to promote the Christianization of his dominions, undertook to establish a permanent <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization. The first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Jordan (968-82), who was appointed suffragan to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, in 970. Posen continued to be the only <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> until the Diocese of Gnesen was created (<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Gnesna</em>; Polish, Gniezno). The latter place was chosen by Duke Boleslaw as a suitable location for a shrine for the remains of <a href="01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a>, who had suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at the hands of the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="12519c.htm">Prussians</a>. When the Emperor <a href="11356a.htm">Otto III</a> made his <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the grave of <a href="01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> in 1000, he established an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> in Gnesen without consulting Bishop Unger of Posen (982-1012), and placed it under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Radim or Gaudentius, brother of <a href="01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a>. At the same time he created the <a href="05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of Cracow, <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, and Kolberg, and incorporated them in the new archdiocese. On the death of Boleslaw, Posen was severed from <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> in the course of the strife engendered by the national opposition to Germanism. Bishop Paulinus elected in 1037, was the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Gnesen. <a href="11100b.htm">St. Norbert</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> succeeded in obtaining a <a href="12783b.htm">papal rescript</a> in 1133, in which the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of his <a href="01694b.htm">archepiscopal see</a> over Posen was still recognised. But since the twelfth century, Posen has undisputedly been <em>de facto</em> a suffragan of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>. Both <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> were dependent on the temporal rulers of the country, who nominated the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at will, disposed arbitrarily of the <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> and <a href="12371a.htm">prebends</a>, and confiscated the estates of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> on their death.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The archiepiscopal See of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, richly endowed with estates and <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>, soon surpassed the older Bishopric of Posen both in extent and importance, and grew to be the most influential <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in the dukedom. In the thirteenth century the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> acquired the Principality of Lowiez. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was further augmented by the addition of the suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of Lebus, Wlockawek, and Plock in the thirteenth century; of Wilna and Lutzk in the fourteenth; of <a href="13421b.htm">Samogitia</a> in the fifteenth, and of <a href="04566a.htm">Culm</a> in the sixteenth. Its <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> also obtained many extremely valuable privileges, both <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and temporal. At the <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> they were given the rank and title of Primas Poloniae et Magni Ducatus Lithuaniae, thereby getting <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> over all the Bishops of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and Lithuania. At the <a href="09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a> in 1515 they were <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the title of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <em>Legatus natus</em>. In 1741 they received the privilege of wearing <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> vestments with the exception of the hat. The primacy entitled them to rank as princes of the empire. From 1572 they held authority as regents of the empire during an interregnum, superintended the election of the king and <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> the successful candidate.</p>

<p>The domestic condition of both bishopries left much to be desired during the first few centuries of their existence, even with respect to the spiritual and moral training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Such was the charge made by <a href="08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> in a letter to Henry I, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> (1200-19), in 1207. He censured the <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> on the ground that the majority of the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were living in open matrimony, that the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were presenting frivolous plays before the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, that theatrical performances were being given in churches, and so forth. Most of the credit for the improvement of both <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> is due to the activities of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, mainly of German foundation. These included <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Augustinians, <a href="14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a> and Knights of St. John, and <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, all of which became centres of prosperous development. Many of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, also, displayed a beneficent solicitude for <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, although on this point there is very little precise information to be obtained. But at least we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that in the synodical <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of 1257 Archbishop Fulk of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> (1232-58) directed the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to establish and maintain <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>; also that Bishop John VII (Lubranski) of Posen (1499-1520) founded a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at Posen, and other <a href="13554b.htm">educational establishments</a>.</p>

<p>Hussitism became widely disseminated throughout both <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the fifteenth century. Its progress was mainly due to the fact that a great number of the sons of the Polish nobility attended the <a href="12342a.htm">University of Prague</a>. Bishop Stanislaus I (Ciolek) of Posen (1428-37) found himself at open variance with the city of Bentschen, whose inhabitants had become prevailingly Hussite, and was even compelled to fly from his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. His successor, on the other hand, Andreas of Bnin (1439-79), forced the city to deliver into his hands five Hussite preachers, whom he had burned at the stake in 1439. The further spread of the Hussite movement was checked by the recall of all Poles living in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and by the prohibition of all commercial intercourse with that country. The doctrines of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, however, found some ready supporters amongst the inhabitants, thanks largely to feuds between the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the nobility. They found acceptance first in the towns in Danzig as early as 1518. In Posen, Bishop John Lubranski (1499-1520) favoured the cause of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, sent to Leipzig for Christopher Endorf the <a href="07538b.htm">humanist</a>, and gave him an appointment in the high school. Petrus Tomicki (1520-25), the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, seemed blind to the danger that menaced the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was not until 1523 that strict measures for the preservation of the Faith were taken at the instance of the king. A kind of inquisition tribunal was instituted, and, at a synod convoked at Lenezye by Archbishop John Laski (1510-31) of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, the bull of <a href="09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> was published. In 1534 the young men of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> were forbidden attend foreign <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. This restraint was somewhat relaxed under Laski's successors, Matthias Drzewicki (1531-35) and <a href="08702c.htm">Andreas Krzycki</a> (1535-37), the latter of whom was the composer of songs to Venus Vulgivaga and on other degrading themes. The conduct of Archbishop Jacob Uchanski (1562 81) in his attempts to establish a national church was marked by the greatest duplicity. The Moravian Brethren meanwhile obtained a footing in the Bishopric of Posen in spite of the opposition of Bishop Benedict Izdbienski (1546-53).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The defeat of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> was mainly due to the energy of <a href="07473a.htm">Cardinal Hosius</a>. He instigated the <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a> and execution of the decrees of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> throughout the country, and had the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> sent thither. Bishop Adam Konarski (1562-74) brought them into Posen in 1571, and in Gnesen <a href="08608a.htm">Archbishop Stanislaus Karnkowski</a> (15821603) entrusted them with the direction of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Kalisch. From a national standpoint, the effect of the victory of the Counter <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was that the German element in both <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> became almost completely Polonized. Among the most important of the subsequent <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> may be mentioned: of the Archdiocese of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, Cardinal Bernhard Maciejowski (1604-08), Laurentius Gembicki (1616-24), Matthias Lubienski (1641-52), Cardinal Micliael Radziejowski (1687-1705), and Stanislaus Szembek (1706-22); of Posen, Andreas Opalenski (1607 23), Arldreas Szoldrski (1636-50), Bartholomew Tarto (1710-15), Prince Theodore Czartoryski (1739-68).</p>

<p>The decline of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> resulted in its partition among <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1773, 1793, and 1795). The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> retained <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> only over that part of the kingdom that fell to the share of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and the Diocese of Posen was also reduced in extent. Whenthe <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> occupation took effect, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was assured of the continued enjoyment of all her possessions, but after the insurrection of 1797 all her estates were confiscated. <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> transferred the primacy to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>; but the title of prince was still attached to the Archbishopric of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> until it too was withdrawn in 1829 by order of the cabinet. At the reorganization of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in 1821, the Russian-Polish part of the Diocese of Posen was cut off; the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was raised to an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, and joined to Gnesen under one <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>. Each <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, however, retained its own suffragan, its own <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and its own consistory. Timotheus Gorzenski (d. 1825) was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Gnesen-Posen, after he had been <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Posen since 1809. The city of Posen, which in the interim had outstripped Gnesen in size and importance, was designated the official seat of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Since the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> regime began, both chapters have had the joint right of electing the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. This right, however, has already <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> illusory in several elections, the <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> throne having been left vacant on several occasions for lengthy periods. After the brief incumbency of Theophilus Wolicki (1828-29), the archdiocese was ruled by <a href="05192c.htm">Martin Dunin</a> (1831-42), a graduate of the Collegium Germanicum. Although he met the views of the government as far as possible on all questions concerning the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, he, with the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="05161b.htm">Clement August von Droste-Vischering</a>, defended the <a href="05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> regarding <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> so steadfastly that he was removed from his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, exiled from his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and later, on his return to Gnesen, was arrested and confined in the fortress of Kolberg. It was only in 1840 that he was reinstated, as the result of the personal interposition of King Frederick William IV. Leo Przluski (1845-65) was succeeded by <a href="09111b.htm">Miecislaus Halka Ledochowski</a> (1866-86), one of the first victims of the "Kulturkampf". On the 24 November, 1873, he was requested to abdicate his office by the chief president of the Province of Posen. Upon his refusal, he was summoned to appear before the court, arrested on the 3 February, 1874, and kept in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> at Ostrowo until February, 1876. Forbidden to stay in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, he went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was raised to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in March, 1876. The <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government had him deposed by the supreme court of the state, and ordered a new election. Both <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters refused to carry out this order, whereupon the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussians</a> confiscated the episcopal possessions. Both suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the official Korytkowski, and other <a href="04049b.htm">clergymen</a> were <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the government, and had variously to suffer <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, exile, fines, the suspension of stipends, and deposition. In 1883, 165 of the 555 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the two <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were without a <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>, and of these 131, embracing 165,000 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, were absolutely without any <a href="04049b.htm">clergyman</a> whatsoever.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1886 Ledochwski resigned his incumbency into the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> hands. The latter appointed a German, Sulius Dinder, to the <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> (1886-90). From the outset his German nationality inspired the distrust of the Poles. He was bitterly attacked by Polish newspapers and at public meetings, because he carried out the wishes of the administration in ordering religious instruction to be given to the higher classes of the secondary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in the German tongue. Even his attitude in espousing in general the cause of the Poles wherever their <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> were affected did nothing to mitigate his unpopularity. He was succeeded by a <a href="12181a.htm">Pole</a>, Florian von Stablewski (1891-1906), who, as in the case of Dinder, was nominated by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. He did his best to keep on good terms with the civil government, promoted the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> by founding <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and preparatory colleges in Gnesen and Posen, improved the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unions and <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, and caused the publication of several <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily and weekly journals. But in spite of his conciliatory policy he was subjected to the attacks of both the German and Polish elements as a result of the excessively obnoxious conditions that prevailed throughout the archdiocese. Since his death it has been without a spiritual head. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is at present in a very troubled state. The Polish population is bitterly hostile to the administration in consequence of the exclusion of their language from the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and of tion policy inaugurated by the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government. The <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> have been altogether removed from the influence of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> of the children; the intermediate <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> are, for the most part, under the guidance of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> directors and teachers. In consequence of the plantation of German settlers, mostly of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> extraction, many <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> have been brought to the verge of ruin. The efforts of the government to Germanize the country and the consequent resistance of the Poles have, in many cases, exceeded all legitimate bounds, and have given rise to conditions which are very detrimental to the interests of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
