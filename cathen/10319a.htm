<p>(MILWAUKIENSIS)</p>

<p>Established as a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, 28 Nov., 1843; became an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, 12 February, 1875, comprises seventeen counties of the <a href="15661b.htm">State of Wisconsin</a>: Columbia, <a href="04722c.htm">Dane</a>, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Green, Green Lake, Jefferson, Kenosha, <a href="09689a.htm">Marquette</a>, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Rock, Sheboygan, Walworth, Washington, Waukesha, an area of 9321 square miles. The <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> city of Milwaukee is picturesquely situated on Milwaukee Bay, on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. Its name is derived from the <a href="01311b.htm">Algonquin</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Indian dialects and means Good Land. In the history of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> it is first mentioned in the "Catholic Almanac" of 1840: "Milvakie, Rev. Mr. Kelly who visits alternately Racine, Rochester, Burlington, Southpost (Kenosha), etc." The first Mass, however, was celebrated in Milwaukee as early as 1837 by Rev. J. Bonduel, a missionary from <a href="06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>, in the home of the "founder of Milwaukee," Solomon Juneau. In the same year Rev. Patrick Kelly came to the city and held services in the court-house till, in 1839, he erected the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church, dedicated to St. Peter, for several years the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. It was afterwards removed to its present site near St. Peter and Paul's Church by Msgr. Leonard Batz, V.G. Northwest territory, of which the present <a href="15661b.htm">State of Wisconsin</a> forms a part, belonged to the Diocese of Quebec and afterwards to Bardstown, Ky., till it was affiliated to the newly created See of <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> in 1821. In 1833, when Detroit was made a see, it became a dependency of that <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. It was in 1841 that the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> visited Milwaukee in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of Rt. Rev. P. Lef&egrave;vre of <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, accompanied by one of his <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, Rev. Martin Kundig, later <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, whose name is inseparably linked with the early history and subsequent growth of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1843, the Fathers of the Fifth <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> petitioned the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to make Milwaukee a see and to appoint the Rev. John Martin Henni as its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h2>Episcopal succession</h2>

<p>John Martin Henni, first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Milwaukee, was born at Obersaxen, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 13 June, 1805. He studied <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he met the Very Rev. Frederic Rese, <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> (later <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a>), who had come there in quest of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the American missions. Together with his fellow student M. Kundig, he landed in New York, in 1828. Having been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, 2 Feb., 1829, he laboured with the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and enthusiasm of an apostle for the scattered <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, traversing the state in all directions, <a href="02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, preaching, and building churches. Later on he was appointed <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> and <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>. He also was the founder of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly, "Der Wahrheitsfreund," for some time the only German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. On 19 March, 1844, Henni was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Milwaukee by <a href="12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a> of <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, and soon after started for his new field of labour. He came accompanied by the Rev. Michael Heiss, who for some time acted as his secretary. The prospects of the new diocese were far from encouraging. He found only four <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the whole extent of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, a few <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> scattered over the territory, and a small frame church encumbered with a heavy <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>. But undaunted by these difficulties the youthful <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> set to work with <a href="15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, and, thanks to his untiring efforts, the number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, mostly immigrants from <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, increased from year to year, so that after three years the number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> had risen from four to thirty. But a rich share of this phenomenal progress is due to the arduous labours and sacrificing spirit of his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, the pioneers of the North-west, men like Mazuchelli, the founder of Sinsinawa, Morrissey, C. Rehrl, Wisbauer, Beitter, Inama, Gaertner, Gernbauer, Holzhauer, Conrad, and others.</p>

<p>In 1847 there arrived from <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> <a href="13415a.htm">Dr. Joseph Salzmann</a>, founder of St. Francis Seminary (Salesianum). In the same year Henni laid the foundation of his new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to <a href="08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>. To raise funds for the building, he made extensive journeys to Cuba and Mexico. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> (afterwards <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) <a href="02387a.htm">Bedini</a>, 31 July, 1853. Owing to the large influx of <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> at that time, St. Mary's church, for the spiritual wants of the German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, was erected in 1846. In the same year the first <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> was opened under <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> auspices in charge of the <a href="03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>. In 1856 the Seminary of St. Francis of Sales, destined to become the fertile nursery of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the North-west, was erected and in the course of years became one of the most flourishing institutions of the country. Its first <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> was the Rev. Michael Heiss, while its founder, the Rev. <a href="13415a.htm">Dr. Salzmann</a>, acted as <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a>. On the elevation of Father Heiss to the episcopal dignity, <a href="13415a.htm">Salzmann</a> was appointed his successor, a position which he held to the time of his death which occurred, 17 January, 1874. <a href="13415a.htm">Salzmann</a> was also the founder of the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> normal <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and of the Pio Nono College. Both institutions were opened in 1871, and have to this day faithfully carried out the intentions of their founder. In 1866 two new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were established in <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> with <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> in <a href="08735b.htm">La Crosse</a> and <a href="06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>. In 1875 Milwaukee was made an <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, with Msgr. Henni as first <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. During the last years of his administration, his burden was considerably lightened by the appointment of Rt. Rev. M. Heiss as coadjutor, with the right of succession, and titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="01161a.htm">Adrianople</a>. Archbishop Henni who is rightly called the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the Northwest, was called to his reward, 7 Sept., 1881.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Michael Heiss was born at Pfahldorf, <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 12 April, 1818. Having finished his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at the famous University of Munich, he spent the first two years of his <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in his home diocese of <a href="05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, and then offered his services to the American mission. He first had charge of St. Mary's church in <a href="04462b.htm">Covington</a>, Ky., where he remained till 1844, when he consented to accompany Bishop Henni of Milwaukee to his new see. Having filled the office of secretary for some years, he was appointed <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Mary's church, Milwaukee. In 1856 he was appointed first <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Francis Seminary, an office which he held till his elevation to the episcopal dignity as first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08735b.htm">La Crosse</a>, in 1868. On the death of Archbishop Henni, in 1881, he succeeded him as <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Archbishop Heiss was known and esteemed as one of the most learned <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the country, a reputation which secured to him a place among the members of the dogmatic commission at the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. His works "De Matrimonio" (Munich, 1861) and "The Four Gospels Examined and Vindicated [on Catholic Principles]" (Milwaukee, 1863), hold a prominent place in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> literature. In 1883 he was invited to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to take part in the deliberations preparatory to the Third <a href="02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, which he also attended in 1884. In 1886 he convoked the First <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Milwaukee, which opened its sessions on 23 May, in St. John's <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Bishops Flasch of <a href="08735b.htm">La Crosse</a>, John Ireland of <a href="13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, Seidenbusch of St. Cloud, Marty, <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Dakota, and Katzer, administrator of <a href="06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>, took part in its deliberations.</p>

<p>During the last years of Archbishop Heiss's wise and peaceful administration, the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> horizon was somewhat darkened by the plot of the <a href="01426a.htm">American Protective Association</a>, a new phase of defunct <a href="08677a.htm">Know-nothingism</a>. In their bigotry and <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of everything <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, they aimed their first blow at the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> by the "Bennett Law" which seriously interfered with the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>. But the timely and united action of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, and their vigorous protest, by which they branded the bill as "unnecessary, offensive, and <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a>," effectively defeated the iniquitous scheme. In 1888 the Diocese of St. Paul was separated from Milwaukee and made an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. Three suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> were thenceforth subject to Milwaukee: La Crosse and Green Bay in the <a href="15661b.htm">State of Wisconsin</a> and Marquette in Upper Michigan. The <a href="14336a.htm">Diocese of Superior</a> was added in 1905. Archbishop Heiss died at St. Francis Hospital, <a href="08735b.htm">La Crosse</a>, 26 March, 1890. His mortal remains rest beneath the sanctuary, of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> at St. Francis, at the side of his faithful friend and co-labourer, <a href="13415a.htm">Joseph Salzmann</a>.</p>

<p>Frederic Xavier Katzer was born at Ebensee, Upper <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 7 February, 1844. His preparatory studies he completed at <a href="09273a.htm">Linz</a>, the capital of Upper <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, under the direction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>. He came to America in 1864. Having finished his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at the Salesianum, he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, 21 December, 1866. After his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> he remained at the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> where he taught mathematics and, later on, philosophy and <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. In 1875 he followed Fr. Krautbauer, the newly appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>, to his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, where he acted as secretary, and afterwards as <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. Upon the death of Bishop Krautbauer, in 1885, he was appointed administrator of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; and on 31 May, 1886, he was chosen <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06777a.htm">Green Bay</a> and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, 21 September of the same year. After the death of Archbishop Heiss he was promoted to the <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> dignity as third <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Milwaukee in December, 1890. Archbishop Katzer was a man of profound learning and a thorough <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>. His poetical talent is evidenced by an allegorical drama, entitled, "Der Kampf der Gegenwart," (The Combat of the Present Age). His administration was marked by a uniform regard for <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and strict adherence to the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He died at Fond du Lac, 4 August, 1903, on the same day on which the great <a href="12260a.htm">pontiff</a> <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> breathed his last. His earthly remains found their last resting place in the little cemetery near the "chapel in the woods" at St. Francis.</p>

<p>Sebastian Gebhard Messmer was born at Goldach, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 29 August, 1847. Having finished his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at the <a href="08024b.htm">University of Innsbruck</a> he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in the same city, 23 July, 1871. In the same year he came to the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, where he joined the <a href="10779c.htm">Diocese of Newark</a>. For several years he taught canon law, Scripture, and <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> in Seton Hall. For a short time he also had charge of St. Peter's, <a href="10779c.htm">Newark</a>, N.J. In 1889 he was called to the chair of canon law in the Catholic University at Washington, but first went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to study Roman <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>. After his return he entered upon his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> as professor and kept this position till his elevation to the episcopal dignity. On 27 March, 1892, he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06777a.htm">Green Bay</a> in St. Peter's Church, <a href="10779c.htm">Newark</a>, by his former classmate, Bishop Zardetti of St. Cloud. On the death of Archbishop Katzer he succeeded him as <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 28 November, 1903. Archbishop Messmer is honourably known as a very able and prolific contributor to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature, and his name is intimately linked with the principal religious movements in the country. Together with Bishop Augustine McFaul of <a href="15037a.htm">Trenton</a> he has been chiefly instrumental in inaugurating the American Federation of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Societies.</p>

<h2>Religious orders in the diocese</h2>

<p><em>Orders of Men</em></p>

<p>The rapid, almost <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> growth of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the <a href="15661b.htm">State of Wisconsin</a> is chiefly due to the <a href="15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> of the pioneer <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular priesthood</a>; but the labours and trials of the early missionaries belonging to <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders ought not to be forgotten. In 1857 the first <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was erected at Mount Calvary, <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>. It has been asserted, not without reason, that the foundation of the Calvary Province is a fact unprecedented in the history of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in this country, in as far as the order of <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> was introduced into <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, not by religious, but by two <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, Rev. Francis Haas and Rev. Bonaventure Frey. The opposition which they met on all sides, the trials which they had to endure, and the undaunted <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> with which they met them, border on the <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. Today the order possesses a flourishing community with <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> and college at Calvary, a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> and two <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in Milwaukee, not to speak of the numerous <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> and communities in other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was established in Milwaukee in 1856, and St. Gall's church, erected in 1849, was placed in charge of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. In 1880 the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> known as Marquette College was opened, and has lately developed into the flourishing <a href="15204b.htm">Marquette University</a>. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, also have charge of the Gesu church, one of the finest <a href="03041a.htm">religious edifices</a> in the Northwest. The Fathers of the Holy Cross conduct the College of the Sacred Heart at Watertown; the <a href="09750a.htm">Servite</a> Fathers, a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Granville Center; and the Discalced <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, lately arrived from <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, attend to the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> on "Holy Hill," a well-known place of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>.</p>

<p><em>Orders of Women</em></p>

<p>The School Sisters of Notre Dame came to Milwaukee in 1855, on the invitation of Bishop Henni, who showed himself their generous friend and protector, especially during the first years when they had to struggle with poverty and violent opposition. To Mother Caroline Friess, who brought the first band of sisters from, <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> to Milwaukee, and who for forty-two years stood at the helm, is principally due the present flourishing <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a> of the community. The sisters have their mother-house and <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in Milwaukee. In 1876 the community was divided into two provinces, with the second mother-house in Baltimore; and in 1895, a third province was formed with a mother-house at St. Louis, Mo. The Sisters of St. Francis have two mother-houses in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, one at St. Francis, where they built their first <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in 1847, near the present site of St. Francis Seminary, the other in Milwaukee (St. Joseph's Convent and the Sacred Heart Sanatorium). The Sisters of St. Agnes have their mother-house at Fond du Lac, where they also have charge of a <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a>, a home for the aged, and an academy. The <a href="12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a> have their mother-house at Racine, and an academy at Corliss. The sisters of these communities teach in the numerous <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> and other states. The <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, too, have a mother-house in Milwaukee. Other communities which have no mother-house in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but are in charge of some charitable or <a href="13554b.htm">educational establishment</a> are: the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent of Paul, <a href="03609a.htm">Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of St. Louis, Mo., Polish <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, Hospital Sisters of St. Francis, <a href="12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, Society of the Divine Saviour, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters of the Perpetual Rosary, Sisters of the Third <a href="12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a> (Sinsinawa), Sisters of the Good Shepherd, <a href="06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a>, and Sisters de Misericorde.</p>
