<p>Sometimes called M<font size=-2>AND&#198;ANS,</font> S<font size=-2>ABIANS,</font> or C<font size=-2>HRISTIANS OF</font> S<font size=-2>T.</font> J<font size=-2>OHN.</font></p>

<p>Nasor&aelig;ans are <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> who shortly before the rise of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, formed a <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> which flourished in Mesopotamia and <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, and which was one of the foremost <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> in Western <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> in the early years of <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>. Though some 2000 <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> strong in the seventeenth century, they have dwindled at the present day to some 1500 adherents living on the Shat-el-Arab near the Persian Gulf. It is the only <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> that has survived and the sacred writings of which are still extant; a few remnants excepted, the writings of the so-called <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> have perished.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Names</h2>

<p>Mand&aelig;an (mndaya) is a Babylonian-Aramaic word in dialectic form, meaning: <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, <em>gnostiko&#237;</em>, "those who are good at knowing". The <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> for <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> md&lsquo; Madda is of the same root and is the noun from which the adjective Mandaya is derived. It is the name adopted by the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> itself, being employed in their sacred books, and is characteristic of their worship of the mnds dhya <em>gn&ocirc;sis t&#234;s do&#234;s</em> or "knowledge of life". Another name also found in their sacred books is that of <em>Sabians</em> (<em>sbya</em>) which means <em>Baptists</em> (sb&lsquo; to <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a> in Syriac and Aramaic). This name is known to the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> (sing. <em>Sabia,</em> pl. fr. <em>Sub&#226;&rsquo;u</em>) from the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a> (Sure V, 73; II, 59; XXII, 17) in which <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, Savians, and <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> are enumerated as <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> which can be tolerated by <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a>. It is based on the prominence of frequent <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> in their religious discipline and hence they are no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> referred to by the Fathers as Hemerobaptists <em>&lsquo;emerobapt&#237;stai</em> i.e. practising daily <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The name <em>Souba&#237;oi</em> was even known in Greek writers. The name, however, most frequently used in their sacred literature is that of Nasoreans, <em>naswraya</em> which is also the usual Arabic (sing. <em>Nasrani,</em> pl. Nas&#226;ra) for <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The coincidence is striking, the more so as the Nasor&aelig;ans have no leaning towards <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but rather contempt and <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> for it; nor do their doctrines betray any approximation to <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, except perhaps in that of the existence of a saviour, although some of their ceremonies bear a superficial resemblance to <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> mysteries. If, however, we remember that the <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> paraded as the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, though their system has but the use of half a dozen terms in common with <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and that some <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> had barely any similarity with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though self-styled <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, it becomes less strange that even Mand&aelig;ans should have styled themselves Nasor&aelig;ans. The term Kristi&#226;n&#226;, as transliteration of the Greek word, they reserve for the followers of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was no doubt a name to conjure with, but the absence of any reason for the adoption of the title remains a mystery. It is suggested by some that the name is only given to the most perfect amongst them, but this seems contrary to fact. The name "Christians of St. John" is of <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> origin and based on a mistake. The Nasor&aelig;ans have an extraordinary veneration for <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, who figures largely in their mythology. This veneration, together with the similarity of their rites to <a href="13295a.htm">Christian sacraments</a>, led the first missionaries from <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> to regard them as descendants of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> only with the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of St. John. Such, e.g. was the impression of the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Ignatius a Jesu, who lived some years in Bassa and wrote a description of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> (1652).</p>

<h2 id="section2">Doctrines</h2>

<p>These are to be gathered from a voluminous compilation called Genza or "The Treasure", and sometimes Sidra Rabba or "The Great Book", of which copies <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are in the Biblioth&#232;que Nationale at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and have been published by Petermann (Thesaurus s. Liber Magnus, vulgo Liber Adami, etc., Berlin, 1867) in Nasor&aelig;an script and language. The former is not unlike Estrangela with vowels added in the modifications of the consonants, and the latter closely resembles that of the Aramaic in the Talmud. The same text in Syriac characters with a somewhat free Latin translation was published by Norberg (London and Gotha, 1817). Selections from the Genza (about one fourth) have been translated into German by Brandt. This book is arbitrarily divided into two sections, called the Right and the Left Genza from the curious Nasor&aelig;an custom of writing these two portions in one volume but in inverted positions, the left being used at funerals and being written for the benefit of the dead. The Genza is a collection of writings from all ages and sources, some dating even after the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquest. Another sacred book is the Kolasta, or "Summa" or practical <em>vademecum</em> containing <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, rites for <a href="09707a.htm">marriages</a>, etc. (published as "Qolasta" by Euting, Stuttgart, 1867). The Sidra de Yahya i.e. Book of St. John or Dr&#226;sh&#234; de malk&#234;, "Lectures of the Kings" was published in 1905 by Lidzbarski and translated with commentary by Ochser in 1905. The Diwan, a <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> ritual, was published by Euting (1904), but the Asfar Malw&#226;she, an <a href="02018e.htm">astrological</a> work on the signs of the Zodiac, is not yet published. In recent years finds of Nasor&aelig;an inscriptions on pottery have added to our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their popular <a href="14339a.htm">superstitions</a> (Pognon, "Une incantation en Manda&#239;te", Paris, 1892; "Inscriptions Mand." <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1808-9; Lidzbarski, "Ephem. f. Sem. Epigr.", Giessen, 1900).</p>

<p>These sources show Nasor&aelig;anism to be a form of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> which stands towards late <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="12223b.htm">polytheism</a> somewhat as <a href="10742b.htm">Neo-Platonism</a> stands towards the Greek and Roman Pantheon. It is an attempt to allegorize the ancient myths as being phases of man's creation and <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, though Nasor&aelig;anism never rids itself of fantastic Eastern imagery. Probably through Nabat&aelig;an commerce these southern Babylonians came into contact with the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the east of the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a> and developed a worship of <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. Their daily <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> is however earlier than St. John's practice and is probably the cause of their <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> regarding St. John rather than the effect of it. They likewise absorbed a great deal of Indian and Parsee philosophy till they developed their <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Light-King, which is similar to the <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> concept of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>, though without an absolutely rigid <a href="05169a.htm">dualism</a>. No religion therefore bears a nearer resemblance to Nasor&aelig;anism than that of Mani, who himself was an eastern Baptist in his youth. Finally, through contact with the <a href="10499a.htm">monotheism</a> of <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, and later Parsees, they gradually drifted towards the acceptance of one <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Their worship of the Light-King is one of singular beauty and elevation. Their &aelig;onology is extremely intricate: the <a href="01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a> are called by the mystical name Utra (&lsquo;wtryya which means: Riches or Potencies; Hebrew &lsquo;sr). It will suffice to mention a few prominent <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Pira Rabba is the source, origin, and container of all things. The meaning of Pira (pyra) is uncertain; of various suggested meanings, perhaps that of "Fruit" (Hebr. pry) is the most likely. This "Fruit" is like the Indian "Golden Egg", the <a href="15017a.htm">transcendental</a> and unconscious "Fullness of Being" out of which all things develop; it is the seed of the fig tree of the <a href="05070c.htm">Gnostic Docet&aelig;</a>; it is the <em>B&uacute;dos</em> of the Valentinians. This Pira Rabba is possessed and filled by the M&#226;n&#226; Rabb&#226;: the Great Spirit, the Great Illustrious One, the Great Splendour or Majesty. From the M&#226;n&#226; Rabb&#226; emanates the First Life, who <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a> for companionship and progeny, whereupon the Second Life, the Ultra Mkayyema or World-constituting &#198;on, the Architect of the Universe, comes into being. This divine architect gives forth a number of <a href="01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a>, who with his permission intend to erect the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>. This however displeases the First Life at whose request the M&#226;n&#226; Rabb&#226; produces as surveyor or foreman of the architect's <a href="01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a> the Mand&#226; d'Hayye or <em>gn&ocirc;sis zo&#234;s</em> the Personified Knowledge of Life i.e. the friend and counsellor of the First Life.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>This Manda de Hayye is the Christ of the Nasor&aelig;ans after whom they are called and around whom all their religious <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> group themselves. As god of order he has to battle with the <a href="01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a> of chaos and thus realize the divine <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> in the world. The whole is a bold and obvious allegory: Marduk is sent by his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> Ea to do battle with the powers of Tiamat. This <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> monster of chaos Nasor&aelig;ans called the Holy Ghost, the Deceiver (spirit is feminine in Aramaic) or Ruha, no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> to spite the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. This Ruha has a son called Ur, the prince of <a href="04764a.htm">devils</a>. Manda de Hayye conquers him and throws him into chains. Unfortunately while Gabriel the Apostle and Petahiel are beginning to create a good world, Ur escapes and begets with Ruha the seven planets, the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and the five elements. A truce is called and Petahiel amicably shares the creation of the world with the sons of Ur and Ruha. The lifeless body of Adam is created, but the "Image of God" is without motion. With the help of Abel, Seth, Enos, and Adakas there is breathed into him the spirit of life. The seven planets, however, and the twelve signs of the Zodiac constitute an <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> influence in the world, which is continually being overcome by the Manda de Hayye. With the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Light-King a considerable modification of &aelig;onology was introduced, but the main outline remained the same. The Light-King, the Father of the <a href="01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a>, begets Manda de Hayye or Protanthropos, Adam as the First man. This Manda de Hayye becomes incarnate in Jibil the Glorious or Hibil Ziva (hybyl zywa). Kessler pointedly remarks that if Manda is the Christ then Hibil is the <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> of Nasor&aelig;anism. Hibil's descents into Hades play a great r&ocirc;le in their <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. Hibil is the Saviour and the Prophet of man. He is Marduk attempting to displace <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>. A last emanation of the Light-King was <a href="08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, who with Hibil, Seth, and Enos are brethren of the Manda de Hayye. Frequent mention is made of heavenly Jordans, being streams of living waters from the <a href="15017a.htm">transcendental</a> realm of light. Hibil Ziva was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 360,000 of them before his descent to the nether world.</p>

<p>The Nasor&aelig;ans strongly repudiate all <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> and asceticism; they have a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a> contempt for the unmarried and repeatedly inculcate the precept "increase and multiply". They reject all <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> and self-denial as useless and unnatural, and if they observed the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> <a href="05789c.htm">fasts</a> at least in outward appearance it was only to avoid trouble and persecutions. They are the reverse of <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>; there may be much <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> in this world but man is bound to make the best of it. No wonder Mani left them. They observe no distinctions of food, except that blood and things strangled are forbidden them, also all food prepared by strangers, and even food bought in the market, must be washed. They have no special hours for <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> except that they must only <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> when it is light, no <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> is heard as long as it is dark. Not the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> Friday, or the Jewish <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, but the <a href="14335a.htm">Christian Sunday</a> is their weekly holyday. This, however, is not a conscious imitation of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, whose "Carpenter-god" they hate as a son of the <a href="04764a.htm">devil</a>. The religious observance of other holidays seems of more recent origin, though no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> their civil observance, as in the case of New Year's day (first day of Wintermonth; their months have thirty days with five intercalary days to make a solar year), is ancient enough, being a festival of ancient <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>. They observe <a href="01767b.htm">Ascension day</a> (of Hibil Ziva returning from Hades) on the eighteenth of first Springmonth, the Great Baptismal Festival on the intercalary days, the Feast of the Egyptians apparently drowned in the <a href="12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> under <a href="11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> (they were not really drowned, but escaped and were the forefathers of the Nasor&aelig;ans), and a few other feasts. They possessed a hierarchical <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to whom they paid a profound veneration. Their patriarch is the Rash Amma, chief of the people, but they seem but rarely to have had such a dignitary; legend says only one before and one after <a href="08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>. A kind of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> form the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>; they are called Ganzivr&#226;, Tarmidh&#226;, and Shecand&#226; or Treasurer, Disciple, and Messenger. The <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is preceded by a so-called retreat of sixty days during which the candidate submits to many quaint rules and <a href="02258b.htm">baptisms</a>. The Shecanda is only an assistant, but the <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> privilege is the power to <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a>; the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the administrator of the community. They possess three great sacramental rites, Mashutha or <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; Pehta and Mabutha or communion, really morsel (bread) and draught (water); and Kusta or troth, a handshake and plighting of troth. Baptism, always in flowing or living water of rivers and brooks, is the greatest of all the rites. Children are <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> as soon as they can bear total immersion. Self-baptism is frequent; the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> when <a href="02258b.htm">baptizing</a> used originally the formula: Thou art signed with the sign of life; the Name of the Life and the Manda de Hayya is named over thee. Baptism takes place on Sunday and on many other occasions when forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is required. It is followed by a kind of anointing with moist sesame. Communion is given in thin unleavened cakes kept in the <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> house and a handful of water. Kushta is a solemn sign of fellowship with brother Nasor&aelig;ans. "Brethren of the flesh pass away, Kushta brethren remain forever", says the proverb. The history of Nasor&aelig;anism is practically unknown. The Genza contains a Book of Kings of a pseudo-historical character, but the utter confusion of their historical reminiscences makes it difficult to find a kernel of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. The Nasor&aelig;ans were lost to history till Ignatius a Jesu brought the news of their existence. They have been a prominent religion, as they were classed with <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> by the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>. It is often held that they once actually dwelt in Palestine near the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a> and immigrated into Chaldea. Their bitter <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of all that is Jewish or <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> (for Moses is a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the Great Deceiver, whom Enos justly brings to the cross), together with their extensive use of Biblical names, would lead one to believe that though their "theology" is Indian-Babylonian they were once historically connected with Jewish <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>
