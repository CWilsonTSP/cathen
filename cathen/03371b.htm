<p>A work in four books (120 or 121 chapters), purporting to be the composition of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and written about 790-92. It is a very severe critique of <a href="11045a.htm">the Seventh General Council</a>, held at Nicaea in 787, particularly as regards its acts and decrees in the matter of sacred images. In fact, it is a grave <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatise in which both the <a href="04312a.htm">Iconoclastic council of 754</a> and its opponent, the aforesaid Second Nicene of 787, are brought before the bar of <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> criticism and judged equally <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, the former for excluding all images from the churches as sheer <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, the latter for advocating an absolute adoration of images. Though launched under the royal name, the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, and philological learning displayed far surpass the known powers of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The author may be <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>; possibly one or more of the Spanish or <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> who were then residing at the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> court. The work had its origin in a very faulty (see Anastasius Bibliothecarius in <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc. XII, 981) Latin version of the Greek acts of the <a href="11045a.htm">Seventh General Council</a> (Second Nicene) which the negligence of the Roman copyists disfigured still more; in one crucial text, e.g., the negative particle was omitted, and in another the council was made to assert that the images were to be adored as the Trinity itself, whereas the genuine Greek text is quite <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. This version was severely criticized by an assembly of <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> at which <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> assisted. Some (85) obnoxious passages were gathered therefrom and brought to <a href="01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a> by Abbot Angilbert for correction. This document is lost, but its content may be gathered from the moderate and prudent reply (794) of Adrian (PL 1247-92; cf. Nam absit a nobis ut ipsas imagines, sicut quidam garriunt, deificemus, etc.). Dissatisfied with this defence of the council (not reputed oecumenical by the king's <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>) <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> caused the preparation (790-92) of the large work in question, known since then as "Quattuor Libri Carolini".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In further explanation of this remarkable step, it has been noted that <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> was at this time much irritated against the Greek Empress Irene, partly for the failure of the marriage projected between her son and his daughter Rotrudis, partly for the protection and help she was affording to Adelchis, the son of the dethroned King of <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, to which may be added a certain jealousy of any authority over his <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> subjects by a Greek council in which they had taken no part. Some believe that he was even then contemplating the assumption of the imperial title, and was therefore only too willing to discredit Greek authority wherever possible. The work was first printed at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1549 by the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Jean du Tillet (Tilius), later <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02784a.htm">Saint Brieuc</a> and then of Meaux, but anonymously and without indication of the place where he found the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Tilius was suspected of a leaning to <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>). While the <a href="03534b.htm">Centuriators of Magdeburg</a> at once made use of it as an evidence of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> corruption of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning images, some <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apologists asserted that it was only an <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> work sent by <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for condemnation, others that it was a <a href="06135b.htm">forgery</a> of Carlstad (the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of Tilius was, after all, a very recent one; Floss, De suspecta librorum Carolinorum a Joanne Tilio editorum fide, Bonn, 1860). They overlooked the fact that <a href="14292b.htm">Augustinus Steuchus</a> (1469-1549) librarian of the Vatican, writing in defence of the Donation of Constantine, had already quoted a passage from the "Libri Carolini" (I, 6) which he declared he had found in a Vatican <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> written in an ancient Lombard hand; it had disappeared, however, by 1759, according to a letter of <a href="11521c.htm">Cardinal Passionei</a> to the learned Abbot Frobenius F&ouml;rster, then meditating a new edition of the work (see preface no. 10 to his edition of the Opera Alcuini. Floss (op. cit.) maintained the thesis of a <a href="06135b.htm">forgery</a>, but the genuinity of the work can no longer be questioned since the discovery (1866) by Reifferscheid of a tenth century (imperfect) <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the Vatican Archives (Narratio de Vaticano Libror. Carol. codice, Breslau, 1873). Moreover, the work is evidenced as extant in the latter half of the ninth century by <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a> (Adv. Hincmar. Laud., c. 20). Its genuinity was long since admitted by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars like <a href="14027c.htm">Sirmond</a> and Natalis Alexander VIII, (Saec. VIII, Diss. VI, 6). The work was reprinted by the imperialist editor Michael Goldast (Imperialia decreta de cultu imaginum, Frankfort, 1608, p. 67, sqq., and Collect. Constitut. imper., I. 23) whence it was taken by others, e.g. <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.L., XCVIII, 989-1248), though the latter had at his disposition the better edition of G. A. Heumann, Augusta Concilii Nicaeni II Censura, i.e. Caroli M. de impio imaginum cultu libri IV (Hanover, 1731). Some excerpts from it are reprinted in Jaff&eacute;, Bibl. Rer. Germanic. VI, 220-42.</p>

<p>The authors of the "Libri Carolini" admit that images may be used as <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ornaments, for purposes of instruction, and in memory of past events; it is foolish, however, to burn <a href="07716a.htm">incense</a> before them and to use lights, though it is quite wrong to cast them out of the churches and destroy them. The writers are <a href="13506d.htm">scandalized</a> chiefly by the Latin term <em>adoratio</em>, taking it wrongly to mean absolute adoration, whereas the original Greek word, Proskynesis, means no more than reverence in a prostrate attitude. So they insist that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone is to be adored (<em>adorandus et colendus</em>). The <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> are to be <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a>, only in a suitable manner (<em>opportuna veneratio</em>). Ecclesiastical tradition, they insist, holds of reverential <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, to the Cross of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, the <a href="01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, and the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. They blame the excessive reverence shown by the Greeks to their emperors, criticize unfavourably the elevation of Tarasius to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and find fault (not always unreasonably) with the Scriptural and patristic <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> of the Greeks. On the other hand, they ignorantly confound the sayings and doings of this <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> council with those of the <a href="04312a.htm">Iconoclastic conciliabulum of 754</a>, frequently misrepresent the facts, and in general exhibit a strong anti-Greek bias. In explanation of their attitude the following words of <a href="07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> (Kircheng., ed. Kirsch, 1904, II, 132) seem appropriate:</p>

<blockquote><p>Apart from the [unrecognized] <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the translation, the acts and decrees of the <a href="11045a.htm">Seventh General Council</a> offended in various ways the customs and opinions of the Teutonic world where <a href="11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, but lately vanquished, was still potent in folklife and manners. The rude semi-heathen Teuton might easily misunderstand in an <a href="07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> sense the honours awarded to images, as yet few in number owing to the uncultivated taste of the people. While, therefore, images were tolerated, they were not yet encouraged and held but a subordinate place. The Greeks had always reverenced highly, not alone the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of the Emperors, but also their portraits and <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a>, and in this respect <a href="07716a.htm">incense</a> and prostrations (Gr. Proskynesis, Lat. <em>adoratio</em>) were immemorial usages. It seemed to them, therefore, that they could not otherwise pay due reverence to the images of the Saviour and the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. It was otherwise with the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>, unaccustomed to prostrate themselves or to bend the knee before their kings. Such acts seemed fitted to express that adoration (latreia) which was due to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone; when exhibited to others they were frequently a source of <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a>. In the Teutonic mind, moreover, the freer <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life of the West already shone by contrast with the extravagance of Oriental emperor-worship.</p></blockquote>

<p>As stated above, <a href="01155b.htm">Pope Hadrian I</a>, in a letter addressed to <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, answered lengthily the eighty-five <em>Capitula</em> submitted to him. He reminded the king that twelve of his <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had taken part in a Roman Synod (previous to the Second Nicene Council) and had approved the "cultus" of images; he refuted a number of the arguments and objections brought forward, and asserted the identity of his teaching with that of the highly-respected <a href="06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a> concerning images. He also defended in a dignified way the Second Nicene Synod, not yet finally acknowledged by him, calling attention at the same time to his own just grievances against the Greeks who still retained the churches and estates that the <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> Leo III (717-41) had <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a> withdrawn from Roman <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. This letter of Pope Adrian (d. 795) may not have been known to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the synod which met at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> in 794 and on the above-described <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> supposition rejected (can. 2) the Second Nicene Council. <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> sent the acts of this synod to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with a demand for the condemnation of Irene and Constantine VI, but seems gradually to have yielded to the mild and prudent firmness of Adrian for whom he professed at all times the most sincere admiration and friendship. A last echo of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conflict crystallized in the "Libri Carolini" is heard at the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Synod of 825, which, no wiser than its predecessor as to the <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> version of the acts in question, sought in vain to obtain from <a href="05598b.htm">Pope Eugene II</a> an abandonment of the position taken by <a href="01155b.htm">Adrian I</a>. Despite the increasing favour of the "cultus" of images among their people, the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> continued their opposition to the Second Nicene Council; the latter, however, eventually gained recognition especially after a new and somewhat more accurate version of its acts and decrees was made by Anastasius Bibliothecarius under <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a> (872-82). In the meantime the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> writer Walafrid Strabo had summarized and popularized the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in his excellent "Liber de exordiis et incrementis rerum ecclesiasticarum", written about 840 (ed. Kn&ouml;pfler, Munich, 1890). See <a href="07620a.htm">ICONOCLASM</a>; <a href="07664a.htm">IMAGES</a>; <a href="06236a.htm">COUNCIL OF FRANKFORT</a>; DUNGAL OF ST. DENYS; JONAS OF ORLEANS.</p>
