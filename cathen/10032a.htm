<p>Prior to the period of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1532, Masses for the repose of the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the donors of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> given for that purpose were upheld in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, but during that year a statute was passed providing that thereafter all uses declared of land, except leaseholds of twenty years, to the intent to have perpetual or the continued service of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, or other like uses, should be void. In the reign of Edward VI (1547), another statute was passed declaring the king entitled to all real and certain specified personal <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> theretofore disposed of for the perpetual finding of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or maintenance of any anniversary or obit, or other like thing, or any light or lamp at any church or <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>. These <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> did not make disposition of personal <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> to such uses void, and the statute of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> was prospective and applied only to assurances of land to <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and that of Edward VI was limited to dispositions of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, real and personal, theretofore made. But the English chancellors and the English judges, in the absence of any express statute, determined all dispositions of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, whether real or personal, given or devised for uses specified in the two <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>, to be absolutely void as contrary to public policy, being for <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a> uses. The decision covered legacies such as to <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of the donor or for the bringing up of poor children in the <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It has been expressly decided that these <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> and the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a> uses as enunciated by the English judges do not apply in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> although the first colonies from which the States grew were established subsequently to the dates of the adoption of the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> referred to, and this, notwithstanding the fact that in some of the states <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> were passed adopting the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> and <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> so far as the same might be applicable to the altered condition of the settlers in the colonies. It has been pointed out that it is a maxim of law in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> that a man may do what he will with his own, so long as he does not violate the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> by so doing or devoted his <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> to an immoral purpose; consequently, since there is a legal equality of <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> and all are thus in the eyes of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> equally <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, to discriminate between what is a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and what a <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a> use would be to infringe upon the constitutional guarantee of perfect freedom and equality of all <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> (see opinion of Tuley, J., in the case of Kehoe v. Kehoe, reported as a note to Gilman v. McArdle, 12 Abb. N. C., 427 New York). In none of the states of the Union, therefore, are bequests or devises of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> for Masses for the dead invalid on the ground of being <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a>, but there is a diversity among the decisions as to the circumstances under which such bequests or devises will be sustained.</p>

<p>In New York the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> on the subject of charitable and religious trusts has been completely abrogated by statute, it being intended that there should be no system of <a href="03592a.htm">public charities</a> in that state except through the medium of corporate bodies. The policy has been to enact from time to time general and special <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> specifying and sanctioning the particular object to be promoted, restricting the amount of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> to be enjoyed, carefully keeping the subject under legislative control, and always providing a competent and ascertained donee to take and use the charitable gifts (Levy v. Levy, 33 N. Y., 97; <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> v. Alcock, 108 N. Y., 312). In accordance with this policy a general act was passed regulating the incorporation of religious bodies, and empowering the trustees to take into their possession <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> whether the same has been given, granted or devised directly to a church, congregation or <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, or to any other <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> for their use (Laws of 1813, c. 60, s. 4, III; Cummings and Gilbert, "Gen. Laws and other Statutes of N. Y.", p. 3401). By the provisions of other <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> churches come under this act (Laws of 1862, c. 45; Cummings and Gilbert, loc. cit., p. 3425). Therefore a bequest of real <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> for Masses will be upheld if it comply with the statutory requirements, which are;</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(1) that the gift be to a corporation duly authorized by its charter or by statute to take gifts for such purpose and not to a private <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>;</li><li>(2) that the will by which the gift is made shall have been properly executed at least two months before the testator's death (Cummings and Gilbert, loc. cit., p. 4470; Laws of 1848, c. 319; Laws of 1860, c. 360: Lef&egrave;vre v. Lef&egrave;vre, 59 N. Y., 434), and</li><li>(3) that if the testator have a wife, child, or parent the bequest shall not exceed one-half of his <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> after his <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> are paid (ibid., see Hagenmeyer's Will, 12 Abb. N. C., 432).</li></ul></div>

<p>Every trust of personal <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, which is not contrary to public policy and is not in conflict with the statute regulating the accumulation of interest and protecting the suspension of absolute ownership in <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of that character, is valid when the trustee is competent to take and a trust is for a lawful purpose well defined so as to be capable of being specifically executed by the court (Holmes v. Mead, 52 N. Y., 332). "If then a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> desire to make provision by will for saying of Masses for his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, there is not the shadow of a <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that every court in the State [New York], if not in the Union, would uphold the bequest if the mode of making it were agreeable to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>" (see careful article written in 1886 by F. A. McCloskey in "Albany Law Journal", XXXII, 367).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>For similar reasons in <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, where all trusts are abolished by statute except certain specified trusts with a definite beneficiary, a gift for Masses, to be good, must not be so worded as to constitute a trust. Thus a bequest in the following language: "I do give and bequeath unto the <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="06777a.htm">Diocese of Green Bay</a>, <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, the sum of $4150, the said sum to be used and applied as follows: For Masses for the repose of my <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, two thousand dollars, for Masses for the repose of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of my deceased wife, etc., etc." The court held that a trust was created by this language, and says: "It is evident that such a trust is not capable of execution, and no court would take cognizance of any question in respect to it for want of a competent party to raise and litigate any question of abuse or perversion of the trust." But it adds: "We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> of no legal reason why any <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> in the efficacy of Masses, may not make a direct gift or bequest to any <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of any sum out of his <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> or estate for Masses for the repose of his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> or the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of others, as he may choose. Such gifts or bequests, when made in clear, direct, and legal form, should be upheld; and they are not to be considered as impeachable or invalid under the rule that prevailed in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> by which they were held void as gifts to <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a> uses" (72 N. W. Rep., 631).</p>

<p>The same view was taken by the Supreme Court of Alabama, where a bequest to a church to be used in solemn Masses for the repose of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of the testator was held invalid inasmuch as it did not respond to any one of the following tests:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(1) that it was a direct bequest to the church for its general uses;</li><li>(2) that it created a charitable use; or</li><li>(3) that it created a valid private trust.</li></ul></div>

<p>It was not a charity inasmuch as it was "for the benefit alone of his own <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, and cannot be upheld as a public charity without offending every principle of law by which such charities are supported and it was not valid as a private trust for want of a living beneficiary to support it (Festorazzi v. St. Joseph's R. C. Church of <a href="10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, 25 Law. Rep. Ann., 360).</p>

<p>In Illinois an opposite conclusion is reached, it being held distinctly that a devise for Masses for the repose of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of the testator, or for the repose of the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of other named <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, is valid as a charitable use, and the devise for such purpose will not be allowed to fail for want of a competent trustee, but the court will appoint a trustee to take the gift and apply it to the purposes of the trust. Such a bequest is distinctly held to be within the definition of charities which are to be sustained irrespective of the indefiniteness of the beneficiaries, or of the lack of trustees, or the fact that the trustees appointed are not competent to take; and it is not derived from the Statute of Charitable Uses (43 Elizabeth, c. 4), but existed prior to and independent of that statute. The court quotes with approval the definition of a charity as given by Mr. Justice Gray of <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>: "A charity in a legal sense may be more fully defined as a gift, to be applied consistently with existing <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> for the benefit of an indefinite number of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, either by bringing their hearts under the influence of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> or religion, by relieving their bodies from disease, suffering, or constraint, by assisting them to establish themselves for life, or by erecting and maintaining public buildings or works, or otherwise lessening the burthen of government. It is immaterial whether the purpose is called charitable in the gift itself, if it be so described as to show that it is charitable in its nature" (Jackson v. Phillips, 14 Allen, 539). The court proceeds to show that the Mass is intended to be a repetition of the sacrifice of the Cross, and is the chief and central act of worship in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; that it is public. It points out the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> on the subject of <a href="12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, and holds that the adding of a particular remembrance in the Mass does not change the character of the religious service and render it a mere private benefit; and further, that the bequest is an aid to the support of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> (Hoeffer v. Clogan, 49 N. E. Rep., 527).</p>

<p>In <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> bequests and devises for Masses are distinctly held to be gifts for <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> uses, the Supreme Court of that state having expressed the same view of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> subsequently adopted in <a href="07653a.htm">Illinois</a>. The court uses the following language: "According to the <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> system of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> there exists an intermediate state of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, after death and before final judgment, during which guilt incurred during life and unatoned for must be expiated; and the temporary punishments to which the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the penitent are thus subjected may be mitigated or arrested through the efficacy of the Mass as a propitiatory sacrifice. Hence the practice of offering Masses for the departed. It cannot be <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> that, in obeying the injunction of the testator, intercession would be specially invoked in behalf of the testator alone. The service is just the same in kind whether it be designed to promote the spiritual welfare of one or many. <a href="12345b.htm">Prayer</a> for the conversion of a single impenitent is as purely a religious act as a petition for the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of thousands. The services intended to be performed in carrying out the trust created by the testator's will, as well as the objects designed to be attained, are all essentially religious in their character" (Rhymer's Appeal, 93 Pa., 142). In <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> care must be taken to observe the provisions of the Act of 26 April, 1855, P.L., 332, which prohibits devises or legacies for charitable or <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> uses, unless by will executed at least one month before the death of the testator. A gift to be expended for Masses, being a <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> use, would come within this statute. The provisions of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> relating to attesting <a href="15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, requiring two credible and disinterested witnesses when any gift is made by will for religious or charitable uses, should also be noted.</p>

<p>In <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> the courts take the same view as those of <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, that gifts for Masses are to be sustained as for <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> uses (Re Schouler, 134 <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 126).</p>

<p>In <a href="08093b.htm">Iowa</a> the Supreme Court has sustained a bequest "to the Catholic priest who may be pastor of the <a href="13121a.htm">R. Catholic</a> Church when this will shall be executed, three hundred dollars that Masses may be said for me", as being valid, though it contains no element of a charitable use. The court says: "We have said that this bequest, if the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> should accept the money, is a private trust: and we think it possesses the essential elements of such a trust, as much as it would if the object were the erection of a monument or the doing of any other act intended alone to perpetuate the memory or name of the testator. But even if there is a technical departure because of no living beneficiary, still the bequest is valid. We have also said that it is not a charity, and we can discover no element of a charity in it. It seems to be a matter entirely personal to the testator. In one or more cases the courts have felt the necessity in order to sustain such a bequest, to denominate it a charity because charitable bequests have had the sanction of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> of no such limitation on testamentary acts as that bequests or devises must be in the line of other such acts, if otherwise lawful" (Moran v. Moran, 73 N. W. Rep., 617).</p>

<p>It follows then that there is no legal inhibition on bequests for Masses in any of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> either on the ground of public policy or because they offend against any inherent principle of right. But care must be taken in drafting the will to observe the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>, where any exist, in relation to devises or bequests in trust for any purpose as well as the current of decisions where cases have arisen. The language should be clear and drawn in accordance with legal rules. It should not be left to the chances of interpretation.</p>
