<h1>The Sacrament of Penance</h1>

<p>Penance is a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the New Law instituted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> in which forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> is granted through the <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> to those who with <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> sorrow confess their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and promise to satisfy for the same. It is called a "sacrament" not simply a function or <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, because it is an outward sign instituted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> to impart grace to the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. As an outward sign it comprises the actions of the penitent in presenting himself to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and accusing himself of his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the actions of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in pronouncing <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> and imposing satisfaction. This whole procedure is usually called, from one of its parts, "confession", and it is said to take place in the "tribunal of penance", because it is a judicial process in which the penitent is at once the accuser, the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> accused, and the <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a>, while the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> pronounces judgment and <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a>. The grace conferred is deliverance from the guilt of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and, in the case of mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, from its <a href="07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a>; hence also reconciliation with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="08573a.htm">justification</a>. Finally, the confession is made not in the secrecy of the penitent's heart nor to a <a href="09094a.htm">layman</a> as friend and advocate, nor to a representative of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> authority, but to a duly <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> with requisite <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and with the <a href="08631b.htm">"power of the keys"</a>, i.e., the power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> which <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> granted to His <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>By way of further explanation it is needful to correct certain <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> views regarding this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> which not only misrepresent the actual practice of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> but also lead to a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> statement and historical evidence. From what has been said it should be clear:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>that penance is not a mere <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> invention devised by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to secure power over <a href="04268a.htm">consciences</a> or to relieve the emotional strain of troubled <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; it is the ordinary means appointed by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> for the remission of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="09580c.htm">Man</a> indeed is <a href="06259a.htm">free to obey or disobey</a>, but once he has <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a>, he must seek pardon not on <a href="04211a.htm">conditions</a> of his own choosing but on those which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has determined, and these for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> are embodied in the Sacrament of Penance.</li><li>No <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02408b.htm">believes</a> that a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, simply as an <a href="07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="09580c.htm">man</a>, however <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> or learned, has power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>. This power belongs to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone; but He can and does exercise it through the ministration of <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>. Since He has seen fit to exercise it by means of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it cannot be said that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> interferes between the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; on the contrary, penance is the removal of the one obstacle that keeps the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> away from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>.</li><li>It is not <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> the mere "telling of one's <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>" suffices to obtain their forgiveness. Without sincere sorrow and purpose of amendment, confession avails nothing, the pronouncement of <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> is of no effect, and the guilt of the <a href="14004b.htm">sinner</a> is greater than before.</li><li>While this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of Divine mercy facilitates the pardoning of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, it by no means renders <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> less <a href="07149b.htm">hateful</a> or its consequences less dreadful to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>; much less does it imply permission to commit <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> in the future. In paying ordinary <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a>, as e.g., by monthly settlements, the <a href="08069b.htm">intention</a> of contracting new <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> with the same creditor is perfectly legitimate; a similar <a href="08069b.htm">intention</a> on the part of him who confesses his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> would not only be wrong in itself but would nullify the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and prevent the forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> then and there confessed.</li><li>Strangely enough, the opposite charge is often heard, viz., that the confession of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is intolerable and hard and therefore alien to the spirit of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the <a href="09397a.htm">loving</a> kindness of its <a href="08374c.htm">Founder</a>. But this view, in the first place, overlooks the fact that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though merciful, is also just and exacting. Furthermore, however painful or humiliating confession may be, it is but a light penalty for the violation of <a href="09071a.htm">God's law</a>. Finally, those who are in earnest about their <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> count no hardship too great whereby they can win back <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> friendship.</li></ul></div>

<p>Both these accusations, of too great leniency and too great severity, proceed as a rule from those who have no experience with the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and only the vaguest <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of what the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches or of the power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> received from <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h3>Teaching of the Church</h3>

<p>The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1551) declares:</p>

<blockquote><p>As a means of regaining grace and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, penance was at all times <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for those who had defiled their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> with any mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. . . . Before the coming of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, penance was not a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, nor is it since His coming a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> for those who are not <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But the Lord then principally instituted the Sacrament of Penance, when, being raised from the dead, he breathed upon His <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a> saying: 'Receive ye the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Whose <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall retain, they are retained' (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs22">John 20:22-23</a>). By which action so signal and words so clear the consent of all the Fathers has ever understood that the <a href="08631b.htm">power of forgiving and retaining sins</a> was communicated to the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and to their lawful <a href="01641a.htm">successors</a>, for the reconciling of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> who have fallen after <a href="02258b.htm">Baptism</a>. (Sess. XIV, c. i) </p></blockquote>





<p>Farther on the council expressly states that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> left <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, His own <a href="15401a.htm">vicars</a>, as judges (<em>praesides et judices</em>), unto whom all the mortal crimes into which the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> may have fallen should be revealed in order that, in accordance with the <a href="08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, they may pronounce the <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> of forgiveness or retention of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>" (Sess. XIV, c. v)</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3>Power to forgive sins</h3>

<p>It is noteworthy that the fundamental objection so often urged against the Sacrament of Penance was first thought of by the <a href="13634a.htm">Scribes</a> when <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> said to the sick man of the palsy: "Thy <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven thee." "And there were some of the <a href="13634a.htm">scribes</a> sitting there, and thinking in their hearts: Why doth this man speak thus? he <a href="02595a.htm">blasphemeth</a>. Who can forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> but <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> only?" But <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> seeing their thoughts, said to them: "Which is easier to say to the sick of the palsy: Thy <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, take up thy bed and walk? But that you may <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="14144a.htm">Son of man</a> hath power on earth to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) I say to thee: Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house" (<a href="../bible/mar002.htm#vrs5">Mark 2:5-11</a>; <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs2">Matthew 9:2-7</a>). <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> wrought a <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a> to show that He had power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and that this power could be exerted not only in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> but also on earth. This power, moreover, He transmitted to Peter and the other <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. To Peter He says: "And I will give to thee the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> of the <a href="08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs19">Matthew 16:19</a>). Later He says to all the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>: "<a href="01407b.htm">Amen</a> I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, shall be bound also in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and whatsoever you shall loose upon earth, shall be loosed also in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs18">Matthew 18:18</a>). As to the meaning of these texts, it should be noted:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>that the "binding" and "loosing" refers not to physical but to spiritual or <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> bonds among which <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is certainly included; the more so because</li><li>the power here granted is unlimited &#151; "<em>whatsoever</em> you shall bind, . . . <em>whatsoever</em> you shall loose";</li><li>the power is judicial, i.e., the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> are authorized to <em>bind</em> and to <em>loose</em>;</li><li>whether they bind or loose, their action is ratified in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. In healing the palsied man <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> declared that "the <a href="14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has power on earth to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>"; here He promises that what these men, the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, bind or loose on earth, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> will likewise bind or loose. (Cf. also <a href="08631b.htm">POWER OF THE KEYS</a>.)</li></ul></div>

<p>But as the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declares, <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> principally instituted the Sacrament of Penance after His <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, a <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a> greater than that of healing the sick. "As the Father hath sent me, I also send you. When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said to them: Receive ye the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Whose <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall retain, they are retained' (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs21">John 20:21-23</a>). While the sense of these words is quite obvious, the following points are to be considered:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> here reiterates in the plainest terms &#151; "sins", "forgive", "retain" &#151; what He had previously stated in figurative language, "bind" and "loose", so that this text specifies and distinctly applies to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> the power of loosing and binding.</li><li>He prefaces this grant of power by declaring that the mission of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> is similar to that which He had received from the Father and which He had fulfilled: "As the Father hath sent me". Now it is beyond <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that He came into the world to destroy <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and that on various occasions He explicitly forgave <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs2">Matthew 9:2-8</a>; <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs20">Luke 5:20</a>; <a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs47">7:47</a>; <a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs5">Revelation 1:5</a>), hence the forgiving of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be included in the mission of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>.</li><li><a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> not only declared that <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> were forgiven, but really and actually forgave them; hence, the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> are empowered not merely to announce to the <a href="14004b.htm">sinner</a> that his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven but to grant him forgiveness&mdash;"whose <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive". If their power were limited to the declaration "<a href="06608a.htm">God</a> pardons you", they would need a <a href="13001a.htm">special revelation</a> in each case to make the declaration valid.</li><li>The power is twofold &#151; to forgive or to retain, i.e., the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> are not told to grant or withhold forgiveness nondiscriminately; they must <a href="01115a.htm">act</a> judicially, forgiving or retaining according as the sinner deserves.</li><li>The exercise of this power in either <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> (forgiving or retaining) is not restricted: no distinction is made or even suggested between one kind of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and another, or between one class of sinners and all the rest: <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> simply says "whose <em><a href="14004b.htm">sins</a></em>".</li><li>The <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> pronounced by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (remission or retention) is also <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> &#151; "they are forgiven . . . they are retained".</li></ul></div>

<p>It is therefore clear from the words of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> that the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> had power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>. But this was not a personal prerogative that was to erase at their death; it was granted to them in their official capacity and hence as a permanent institution in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; no less permanent than the mission to teach and <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a> all nations. <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> foresaw that even those who received <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, whether during the lifetime of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> or later, would fall into <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and therefore would need forgiveness in order to be <a href="13407a.htm">saved</a>. He must, then, have intended that the power to forgive should be transmitted from the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to their <a href="01641a.htm">successors</a> and be used as long as there would be sinners in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that means to the end of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> also <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, but this does not warrant the view that the power to forgive is simply the power to <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a>. In the first place, as appears from the texts cited above, the power to forgive is also the power to retain; its exercise involves a judicial action. But no such action is implied in the commission to <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a> (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs18">Matthew 28:18-20</a>); in fact, as the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> affirms, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> does not pass judgment on those who are not yet members of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and membership is obtained through <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Furthermore, <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because it is a new birth, cannot be repeated, whereas the power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> (penance) is to be used as often as the sinner may need it. Hence the condemnation, by the same Council, of any one "who, confounding the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, should say that <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself is the Sacrament of Penance, as though these two <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were not distinct and as though penance were not rightly called the second plank after shipwreck" (Sess. XIV, can. 2 de sac. poen.).</p>

<p>These pronouncements were directed against the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> teaching which held that penance was merely a sort of repeated <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and as <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> effected no real forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> but only an external covering over of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, the same, it was alleged, must be the case with penance. This, then, as a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is superfluous; <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> is only a declaration that <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is forgiven through <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and satisfaction is needless because <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> has satisfied once for all <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>. This was the first sweeping and radical denial of the Sacrament of Penance. Some of the earlier <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> had claimed that only <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the state of grace could validly <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a>, but they had not denied the <a href="05543b.htm">existence</a> of the power to forgive. During all the preceding centuries, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in this power had been so clear and strong that in order to set it aside <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to strike at the very constitution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and reject the whole content of <a href="15006b.htm">Tradition</a>.</p>

<h3>Belief and practice of the early Church</h3>

<p>Among the <a href="10415a.htm">modernistic</a> propositions condemned by <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili sane" (3 July, 1907) are the following:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>"In the primitive <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> there was no concept of the reconciliation of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="14004b.htm">sinner</a> by the authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by very slow degrees only grew accustomed to this concept. Moreover, even after penance came to be recognized as an institution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, it was not called by the name of <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because it was regarded as an odious <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>." (46)</li><li>"The Lord's words: 'Receive ye the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whose <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and whose <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> you shall retain they are retained' (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs22">John 20:22-23</a>), in no way refer to the Sacrament of Penance, whatever the Fathers of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> may have been pleased to assert." (47)</li></ul></div>

<p>According to the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the consensus of all the Fathers always understood that by the words of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> just cited, the power of forgiving and retaining <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> was communicated to the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and their lawful <a href="01641a.htm">successors</a> (Sess. XIV, c. i). It is therefore <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> from the earliest times <a href="02408b.htm">believed</a> in the power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> as granted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Such a <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in fact was clearly inculcated by the words with which <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> granted the power, and it would have been inexplicable to the early <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> if any one who professed <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> had questioned the <a href="05543b.htm">existence</a> of that power in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if, contrariwise, we suppose that no such <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> existed from the beginning, we encounter a still greater difficulty: the first mention of that power would have been regarded as an innovation both needless and intolerable; it would have shown little practical wisdom on the part of those who were endeavouring to draw <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and it would have raised a protest or led to a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> which would certainly have gone on record as plainly at least as did early divisions on matters of less importance. But no such record is found; even those who sought to limit the power itself presupposed its <a href="05543b.htm">existence</a>, and their very attempt at limitation put them in opposition to the prevalent <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Turning now to evidence of a positive sort, we have to note that the statements of any Father or <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer regarding penance present not merely his own personal view, but the commonly accepted <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>; and furthermore that the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> which they record was no novelty at the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, but was the <a href="15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> handed down by the regular teaching of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and embodied in her practice. In other words, each <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> speaks for a past that reaches back to the beginning, even when he does not expressly appeal to <a href="15006b.htm">tradition</a>.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (d. 430) warns the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>: "Let us not listen to those who deny that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church of God</a> has power to <em>forgive all <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a></em>" (De agon.

The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="11181c.htm">obeys</a> Him in both respects, by binding <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and by loosing it; for the Lord willed that for both the power should be equal" (<a href="../fathers/34061.htm"><em>On Penance</em> I.2.6</a>).</li><li>Again he teaches that this power was to be a function of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. "It seemed impossible that <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> should be forgiven through penance; <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> granted this (power) to the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and from the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> it has been transmitted to the office of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>" (<a href="../fathers/34062.htm"><em>On Penance</em> II.2.12</a>).</li><li>The power to forgive extends to all <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>: "<a href="06608a.htm">God</a> makes no distinction; He promised mercy to all and to His <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> He granted the authority to pardon <em>without any exception</em>" (<a href="../fathers/34061.htm"><em>On Penance</em> I.3.10</a>).</li><li>Against the same <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> St. Pacian, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02288e.htm">Barcelona</a> (d. 390), wrote to Sympronianus, one of their leaders: "This (forgiving <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>), you say, only <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> can do. Quite <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>: but what He does through His <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> is the doing of His own power" (Ep.

Wherefore, he concludes, "it were manifest folly to condemn so great a power without which we can neither obtain <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> nor come to the fulfillment of the promises. . . . Not only when they (the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>) <a href="12714a.htm">regenerate</a> us (<a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>), but also after our new birth, they can forgive us our <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../fathers/19223.htm"><em>On the Priesthood</em> III.5 sq.</a>).</li><li><a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> (d. 373): "As the man whom the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> baptizes is enlightened by the grace of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so does he who in penance confesses his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, receive through the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> forgiveness in virtue of the grace of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (Frag. contra Novat. in P.G., XXVI, 1315).</li></ul></div>

<p>These extracts show that the Fathers recognized in penance a power and a utility quite distinct from that of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Repeatedly they compare in figurative language the two means of obtaining pardon; or regarding <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> as spiritual birth, they describe penance as the remedy for the ills of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> contracted after that birth. But a more important fact is that both in the West and in the East, the Fathers constantly appeal to the words of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> and given them the same interpretation that was given eleven centuries later by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. In this respect they simply echoed the teachings of the earlier Fathers who had defended <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> against the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> of the third and second centuries. Thus <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> in his <a href="../fathers/050703.htm">"De lapsis"</a> (A.D. 251) rebukes those who had fallen away in <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but he also exhorts them to penance: "Let each confess his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> while he is still in this world, while his confession can be received, while satisfaction and the forgiveness granted by the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> is acceptable to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" (c. xxix). (See <a href="09001b.htm">LAPSI</a>.) The <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, on the contrary, asserted that "it is unlawful to admit <a href="01624b.htm">apostates</a> to the communion of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; their forgiveness must be left with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> who alone can grant it" (<a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26015.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.28</a>). <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a> and his party did not at first deny the power of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>; they affirmed that <a href="01624b.htm">apostasy</a> placed the sinner beyond the reach of that power &#151; an <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> which was condemned by a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 251 (See <a href="11138a.htm">NOVATIANISM</a>.)</p>

<p>The distinction between <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> that could be forgiven and others that could not, originated in the latter half of the second century as the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, and especially of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. While still a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> wrote (A.D. 200-6) his <a href="../fathers/0320.htm">"De poenitentia"</a> in which he distinguishes two kinds of penance, one as a preparation for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the other to obtain forgiveness of certain grievous <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, i.e., <a href="01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a>, and <a href="01163a.htm">adultery</a>. For these, however, he allows only one forgiveness: "Foreseeing these poisons of the <a href="04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, although the gate of forgiveness has been shut and fastened up with the bar of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, has permitted it still to stand somewhat open. In the <a href="15387a.htm">vestibule</a> He has stationed a second repentance for opening to such as knock; but now once for all, because now for the second time; but never more, because the last time it had been in vain. . . . However, if any do incur the <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> of a second repentance, his spirit is not to be forthwith cut down and undermined by <a href="04755a.htm">despair</a>. Let it be irksome to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> again, but let it not be irksome to repent again; let it be irksome to imperil oneself again, but let no one be ashamed to be set free again. Repeated sickness must have repeated medicine" (<a href="../fathers/0320.htm"><em>On Penance</em> 7</a>). <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> does not deny that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> can forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>; he warns sinners against relapse, yet exhorts them to repent in case they should fall. His attitude at the time was not surprising, since in the early days the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> above mentioned were severely dealt with; this was done for <a href="05030a.htm">disciplinary</a> reasons, not because the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> lacked power to forgive.</p>

<p>In the <a href="10321a.htm">minds</a>, however, of some people the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> was developing that not only the exercise of the power but the power itself was limited. Against this <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> notion Pope Callistus (218-22) published his "peremptory edict" in which he declares: "I forgive the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> both of <a href="01163a.htm">adultery</a> and of fornication to those who have done penance." Thereupon <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, now become a <a href="10521a.htm">Montanist</a>, wrote his <a href="../fathers/0407.htm">"De pudicitia"</a> (A.D. 217-22). In this work he rejects without scruple what he had taught as a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>: "I blush not at an <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> which I have cast off because I am delighted at being rid of it . . . one is not ashamed of his own improvement." The <a href="05525a.htm">"error"</a> which he imputes to <a href="03183d.htm">Callistus</a> and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> could forgive all <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>: this, therefore, was the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> denied. In place of it he sets up the distinction between lighter <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> could forgive and more grievous <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone could forgive. Though in an earlier treatise, <a href="../fathers/0318.htm">"Scorpiace" (chapter 10)</a>, he had said that "the Lord left here to Peter and through him to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> the keys of heaven" he now denies that the power granted to Peter had been transmitted to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, i.e., to the <em>numerus episcoporum</em> or body of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Yet he claims this power for the "spirituals" (<em>pneumatici</em>), although these, for prudential reasons, do not make use of it. To the arguments of the "Psychici", as he termed the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, he replies: "But the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, you say, has the power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. This I, even more than you, acknowledge and adjudge. I who in the new <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a> have the <a href="11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> saying: 'The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> can forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, but I will not do that (forgive) lest they (who are forgiven) fall into other <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../fathers/0407.htm"><em>On Pudicity</em> 21.7</a>). Thus <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, by the accusation which he makes against the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and by the restriction which he places upon the exercise of the power of forgiving <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, bears witness to the existence of that power in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> which he had <a href="01624b.htm">abandoned</a>.</p>

<p>Not content with assailing <a href="03183d.htm">Callistus</a> and his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> refers to the <a href="../fathers/0201.htm">"Shepherd"</a> (<em>Pastor</em>), a work written A.D. 140-54, and takes its author Hermas to task for favouring the pardon of <a href="01163a.htm">adulterers</a>. In the days of Hermas there was evidently a school of rigorists who insisted that there was no pardon for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> committed after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> (<a href="../fathers/02013.htm"><em>Similitude</em> VIII.6</a>). Against this <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> the author of the <a href="../fathers/0201.htm">"Pastor"</a> takes a resolute stand. He teaches that by penance the sinner may <a href="07465b.htm">hope</a> for reconciliation with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. "Go and tell all to repent and they shall live unto <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Because the Lord having had compassion, <em>has sent me</em> to give <a href="11618b.htm">repentance</a> to all <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>, although some are not worthy of it on account of their <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>" (<a href="../fathers/02013.htm"><em>Similitude</em> VIII.2</a>). Hermas, however, seems to give but one opportunity for such reconciliation, for in <a href="../fathers/02012.htm"><em>Mandate</em> IV.1</a>, he seems to state categorically that "there is but one repentance for the servants of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>", and further on in <a href="../fathers/02012.htm"><em>Mandate</em> IV.3</a> he says the <em>Lord</em> has had mercy on the work of his hands and hath set repentance for them; "and he has entrusted <em>to me</em> the power of this repentance. And therefore I say to you, if any one has <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a> . . he has opportunity to repent once". Repentance is therefore possible at least once in virtue of a power vested in the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. That Hermas here <a href="08069b.htm">intends</a> to say that the sinner could be <a href="01061a.htm">absolved</a> only once in his whole life is by no means a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> conclusion. His words may well be understood as referring to public penance (see below) and as thus understood they imply no limitation on the <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> power itself. The same interpretation applies to the statement of <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (d. <em>circa</em> A.D. 215): "For <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> being very merciful has vouchsafed in the case of those who, though in <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, have fallen into transgression, a second repentance, so that should anyone be <a href="14504a.htm">tempted</a> after his calling, he may still receive a penance not to be repented of" (<a href="../fathers/02102.htm"><em>Stromata</em> II.13</a>).</p>

<p>The <a href="05543b.htm">existence</a> of a regular system of penance is also hinted at in the work of <a href="04045a.htm">Clement</a>, <a href="../fathers/0207.htm">"Who is the rich man that shall be saved?"</a>, where he tells the story of the <a href="08492a.htm">Apostle John</a> and his journey after the young bandit. <a href="08492a.htm">John</a> pledged his word that the youthful robber would find forgiveness from the <a href="08374c.htm">Saviour</a>; but even then a long serious penance was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> before he could be restored to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. And when Clement concludes that "he who welcomes the <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> of penance . . . will not be ashamed when he sees the <a href="08374c.htm">Saviour</a>", most <a href="04157a.htm">commentators</a> think he alludes to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> who presided over the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of public penance. Even earlier, <a href="05010a.htm">Dionysius of Corinth</a> (d. <em>circa</em> A.D. 170), setting himself against certain growing <a href="09645c.htm">Marcionistic</a> traditions, taught not only that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> has left to His <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> the power of pardon, but that no <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is so great as to be excluded from the exercise of that power. For this we have the authority of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, who says (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.23</a>): "And writing to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> which is in <a href="01380d.htm">Amastris</a>, together with those in <a href="12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, he commands them to receive those who come back after <em>any fall, whether it be delinquency or <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a></em>".</p>

<p>The <a href="../fathers/0714.htm"><em>Didache</em></a> written at the close of the first century or early in the second, in <a href="../fathers/0714.htm#chapter4">4.14</a> and again in <a href="../fathers/0714.htm#chapter14">14.1</a>, commands an individual confession in the congregation: "In the congregation thou shalt confess thy <a href="14004b.htm">transgressions</a>"; or again: "On the <a href="14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a> come together and <a href="10006a.htm">break bread</a> . . . having confessed your <a href="14004b.htm">transgressions</a> that your sacrifice may be pure." <a href="04012c.htm">Clement I</a> (d. 99) in his <a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle to the Corinthians</em></a> not only exhorts to repentance, but begs the seditious to "submit themselves to the <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and receive correction so as to repent" (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm">chapter 57</a>), and <a href="07644a.htm">Ignatius of Antioch</a> at the close of the first century speaks of the mercy of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to sinners, provided they return" with one consent to the unity of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the communion of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>". The clause "communion of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>" evidently means the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> with his council of <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a> as <a href="01799b.htm">assessors</a>. He also says (<a href="../fathers/0108.htm"><em>Letter to the Philadelphians</em></a>) "that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> presides over penance".</p>

<p>The transmission of this power is plainly expressed in the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> used at the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> as recorded in the Canons of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>: "Grant him, 0 Lord, the <a href="02581b.htm">episcopate</a> and the spirit of clemency and the power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>" (c. xvii). Still more explicit is the formula cited in the <a href="../fathers/0715.htm">"Apostolic Constitutions"</a>: "Grant him, O Lord almighty, through Thy <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the participation of Thy <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, in order that he may have the power to remit <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> according to Thy <a href="12372b.htm">precept</a> and Thy command, and to loosen every bond, whatsoever it be, according to the power which Thou hast granted to the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>." (<a href="../fathers/07158.htm"><em>Apostolic Constitutions</em> VIII.5</a>). For the meaning of "episcopus", "sacerdos", "presbyter", as used in ancient documents, see <a href="02581b.htm">BISHOP</a>; <a href="07322c.htm">HIERARCHY</a>.</p>

<h3>Exercise of the power</h3>

<p>The granting by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> of the power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> is the first <a href="05543b.htm">essential</a> of the Sacrament of Penance; in the actual exercise of this power are included the other <a href="06319a.htm">essentials</a>. The <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> as such and on its own account has a <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and a <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> and it produces certain effects; the <a href="08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> is exercised by a <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> (confessor) who must possess the proper qualifications, and the effects are wrought in the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of the recipient, i.e., the penitent who with the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> dispositions must perform certain actions (confession, satisfaction).</p>

<h3>Matter and form</h3>

<p>According to <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4084.htm#article2"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.84.2</a>) "the <a href="01115a.htm">acts</a> of the penitent are the proximate <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>". This is also the teaching of <a href="05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> in the "Decretum pro Armenis" (<a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, 1439) which calls the <a href="01115a.htm">act's</a> "<em>quasi materia</em>" of penance and enumerates them as <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a>, confession, and satisfaction (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchir.", 699). The <a href="14698b.htm">Thomists</a> in general and other eminent <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, e.g., <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, Toletus, <a href="14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a>, and <a href="09418b.htm">De Lugo</a>, hold the same opinion. According to <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a> (In IV Sent., d. 16, q. 1, n. 7) "the Sacrament of Penance is the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> imparted with certain words" while the acts of the penitent are required for the worthy reception of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. The <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> as an external <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is the <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a>, and, as possessing significant force, the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a>. Among the advocates of this theory are <a href="02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, <a href="03314a.htm">Capreolus</a>, Andreas Vega, and <a href="09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a>. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIV, c. 3) declares: "the acts of the penitent, namely <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a>, confession, and satisfaction, are the <em>quasi materia</em> of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>". The <a href="13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a> used in 1913 (II, v, 13) says: "These actions are called by the Council <em>quasi materia</em> not because they have not the <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a>, but because they are not the sort of <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> which is employed externally as water in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> in <a href="04215b.htm">confirmation</a>". For the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussion see <a href="11430c.htm">Palmieri</a>, op. cit., p. 144 sqq.; <a href="11739b.htm">Pesch</a>, "Praelectiones dogmaticae", Freiburg, 1897; De San, "De poenitentia", Bruges, 1899; Pohle, "Lehrb. d. Dogmatik". Regarding the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, both the <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> and the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> teach that it consists in the words of <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>. "The <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> of the <a href="13295a.htm">Sacrament</a> of penance, wherein its force principally consists, is placed in those words of the <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a>: "I <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee, etc."; to these words indeed, in accordance with the usage of Holy Church, certain <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> are laudably added, but they do not pertain to the <a href="05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> nor are they <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>" (<a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, Sess. XIV, c. 3). Concerning these additional <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the use of the <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern</a> and <a href="09022a.htm">Western Churches</a>, and the question whether the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> is deprecatory or indicative and personal, see <a href="01061a.htm">ABSOLUTION</a>. Cf. also the writers referred to in the preceding paragraph.</p>

<h3>Effect</h3>

<p>"The effect of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is deliverance from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>). The same <a href="04675b.htm">definition</a> in somewhat different terms is given by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIV, c. 3): "So far as pertains to its force and efficacy, the effect (<em>res et effectus</em>) of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is reconciliation with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, upon which there sometimes follows, in <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and devout recipients, peace and calm of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> with intense consolation of spirit". This reconciliation implies first of all that the guilt of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted, and consequently also the <a href="07207a.htm">eternal punishment</a> due to mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. As the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declares, penance requires the performance of satisfaction "not indeed for the <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> penalty which is remitted together with the guilt either by the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> or by the desire of receiving the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, but for the temporal penalty which, as the <a href="13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> teach, is not always forgiven entirely as it is in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>" (Sess. VI, c. 14). In other words <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> frees the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> not only from all <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> but also from all <a href="04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> to Divine <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, whereas after the reception of <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> in penance, there may and usually does remain some temporal <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> to be discharged by works of satisfaction (see below). "Venial <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> by which we are not deprived of the <a href="06689a.htm">grace of God</a> and into which we very frequently fall are rightly and usefully declared in confession; but mention of them may, without any fault, be omitted and they can be expiated by many other remedies" (Council of Trent, Sess. XIV, c. 3). Thus, an <a href="01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a> suffices to obtain forgiveness of venial <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the same effect is produced by the worthy reception of <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> other than penance, e.g., by <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The reconciliation of the sinner with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has as a further consequence the revival of those <a href="10202b.htm">merits</a> which he had obtained before committing grievous <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. Good <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> performed in the state of grace deserve a reward from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, but this is forfeited by mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that if the sinner should die unforgiven his good deeds avail him nothing. So long as he remains in <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, he is incapable of <a href="10202b.htm">meriting</a>: even works which are good in themselves are, in his case, worthless: they cannot revive, because they never were alive. But once his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is cancelled by penance, he regains not only the state of grace but also the entire store of <a href="10202b.htm">merit</a> which had, before his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, been placed to his credit. On this point <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> are practically unanimous: the only hindrance to obtaining reward is <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and when this is removed, the former title, so to speak, is revalidated. On the other hand, if there were no such revalidation, the loss of <a href="10202b.htm">merit</a> once acquired would be equivalent to an <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, which is incompatible with the forgiveness effected by penance. As to the further question regarding the manner and extent of the revival of <a href="10202b.htm">merit</a>, various opinions have been proposed; but that which is generally accepted holds with <a href="14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a> (De reviviscentia meritorum) that the revival is complete, i.e., the forgiven penitent has to his credit as much <a href="10202b.htm">merit</a> as though he had never <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a>. See De Augustinis, "De re sacramentaria", II, Rome, 1887; <a href="11739b.htm">Pesch</a>, op. cit., VII; G&ouml;ttler, "Der hl. Thomas v. Aquin u. die vortridentinischen Thomisten &uuml;ber die Wirkungen d. Bussakramentes", Freiburg, 1904.</p>

<h3>The minister (i.e., the confessor)</h3>

<p>From the judicial character of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> it follows that not every member of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is qualified to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>; the administration of penance is reserved to those who are invested with authority. That this power does not belong to the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> is evident from the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> "Inter cunctas" (1418) which among other questions to be answered by the followers of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> and <a href="07584b.htm">Huss</a>, has this: "whether he <a href="02408b.htm">believes</a> that the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> . . . is bound as a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> to confess to a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> only and <a href="09094a.htm">not to a layman or to laymen</a> however good and devout" (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchir.", 670). <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> proposition, that "any <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, even a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> or a child" could in the absence of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> as well as <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was condemned (1520) by <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exurge Domine" (Enchir., 753). The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIV, c. 6) condemns as "false and as at variance with the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Gospel all doctrines which extend the <a href="10326a.htm">ministry</a> of the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> to any others than <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, imagining that the words of the Lord (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs18">Matthew 18:18</a>; <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs23">John 20:23</a>) were, contrary to the institution of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, addressed to all the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> in such wise that each and every one has the power of remitting <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>". The <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, therefore, is that only <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> can exercise the power.</p>

<p>These <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> moreover put an end, practically, to the usage, which had sprung up and lasted for some time in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, of <a href="09094a.htm">confessing to a layman</a> in case of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a>. This <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> originated in the conviction that he who had <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a> was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make known his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> to some one &#151; to a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> if possible, otherwise to a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>. In the work "On true penance and false" (De vera et falsa poenitentia), <a href="05525a.htm">erroneously</a> ascribed to St. Augustine, the counsel is given: "So great is the power of confession that if a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> be not at hand, let him (the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> desiring to confess) <a href="09094a.htm">confess to his neighbour</a>." But in the same place the explanation is given: "although he to whom the confession is made has no power to <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a>, nevertheless he who confesses to his fellow (<em>socio</em>) becomes worthy of pardon through his desire of confessing to a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>" (P.L., XL, 1113). Lea, who cites (I, 220) the assertion of the Pseudo-Augustine about <a href="09094a.htm">confession to one's neighbour</a>, passes over the explanation. He consequently sets in a wrong light a series of incidents illustrating the practice and gives but an imperfect <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussion which it aroused. Though <a href="01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> (In IV Sent., dist. 17, art. 58) regarded as <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> granted by a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> while <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (IV Sent., d. 17, q. 3, a. 3, sol. 2) speaks of it as "quodammodo sacramentalis", other great <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> took a quite different view. <a href="01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> (Summa, Q. xix, De confessione memb., I, a. 1) says that it is an "imploring of <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>"; <a href="02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> ("Opera', VII, p. 345, Lyons, 1668) that such a confession even in cases of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> is not <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, but merely a sign of <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a>; <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a> (IV Sent., d. 14, q. 4) that there is no <a href="12372b.htm">precept</a> <a href="11189a.htm">obliging</a> one to <a href="09094a.htm">confess to a layman</a> and that this practice may be very detrimental; <a href="05208a.htm">Durandus of St. Pourcain</a> (IV Sent., d. 17, q. 12) that in the absence of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, who alone can <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> in the tribunal of penance, there is no <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to confess; Prierias (Summa Silv., s.v. <em>Confessor</em>, I, 1) that if <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> is given by a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>, the confession must be repeated whenever possible; this in fact was the general opinion. It is not then surprising that <a href="14152a.htm">Dominicus Soto</a>, writing in 1564, should find it difficult to <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> that such a <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> ever existed: "since (in <a href="09094a.htm">confession to a layman</a>) there was no <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> . . . it is incredible that <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>, of their own accord and with no profit to themselves, should reveal to others the secrets of their <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>" (IV Sent., d. 18, q. 4, a. 1). Since, therefore, the weight of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinion gradually turned against the practice and since the practice never received the <a href="13428a.htm">sanction</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, it cannot be urged as a <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that the power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> belonged at any <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> to the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>. What the practice does show is that both people and <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> realized keenly the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of confessing their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> not to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone but to some <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> listener, even though the latter possessed no power to <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a>.</p>

<p>The same exaggerated notion appears in the practice of confessing to the <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> in case of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a>. They were naturally preferred to <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> when no <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> was accessible because in virtue of their office they administered <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. Moreover, some of the earlier councils (<a href="05395b.htm">Elvira</a>, A.D. 300; Toledo, 400) and penitentials (Theodore) seemed to grant the power of penance to the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> (in the <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> absence). The Council of Tribur (895) declared in regard to bandits that if, when captured or wounded they confessed to a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, they should not be denied communion; and this expression "presbytero vel diacono" was incorporated in the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Gratian and in many later documents from the tenth century to the thirteenth. The Council of York (1195) <a href="04670a.htm">decreed</a> that except in the gravest <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> should not <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a>, give communion, or "impose penance on one who confessed". Substantially the same enactments are found in the Councils of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> (1200) and <a href="13211a.htm">Rouen</a> (1231), the constitutions of <a href="05294a.htm">St. Edmund of Canterbury</a> (1236), and those of Walter of Kirkham, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05211a.htm">Durham</a> (1255). All these enactments, though stringent enough as regards ordinary circumstances, make exception for urgent <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a>. No such exception is allowed in the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Synod of Poitiers (1280): "desiring to root out an <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> abuse which has grown up in our <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> through dangerous <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, we forbid <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> to hear confessions or to give <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> in the tribunal of penance: for it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> and beyond <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they cannot <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a>, since they have not the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> which are conferred only in the <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> order". This "abuse" probably disappeared in the fourteenth or fifteenth century; at all events no direct mention is made of it by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, though the reservation to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="01061a.htm">absolving</a> power shows plainly that the Council excluded <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>.</p>

<p>The authorization which the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> councils gave the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> in case of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> did not confer the power to forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>. In some of the <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> it is expressly stated that the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> has not the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> &#151; <em>claves non habent</em>. In other enactments he is forbidden except in cases of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> to "give" or "impose penance", <em>poenitentiam dare, imponere</em>. His function then was limited to the <em>forum externum</em>; in the absence of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> he could "reconcile" the sinner, i.e., restore him to the communion of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; but he did not and could not give the <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> which a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> would have given (Palmieri, <a href="11739b.htm">Pesch</a>). Another explanation emphasizes the fact that the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> could faithfully administer the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. The <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> were under a strict <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to receive Communion at the approach of death, and on the other hand the reception of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> sufficed to blot out even mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> provided the communicant had the requisite dispositions. The <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> could hear their confession simply to assure himself that they were properly disposed, but not for the purpose of giving them <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>. If he went further and "imposed penance" in the stricter, <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> sense, he exceeded his power, and any authorization to this effect granted by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> merely showed that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was in <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> (Laurain, "De l'intervention des la&iuml;ques, des diacres et des abbesses dans l'administration de la p&eacute;nitence", Paris, 1897). In any case, the prohibitory enactments which finally abolished the practice did not deprive the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of a power which was his by virtue of his office; but they brought into clearer light the <a href="15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> that only <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> can administer the Sacrament of Penance. (See below under <em>Confession</em>.)</p>

<p>For valid administration, a twofold power is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>: the power of order and the <a href="08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>. The former is conferred by <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, the latter by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority (see JURISDICTION). At his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> receives the power to <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and for valid <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> he needs no <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. As regards penance, the case is different: "because the <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> of a judgment requires that <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> be pronounced only on those who are subjects (of the judge) the <a href="03744a.htm">Church of God</a> has always held, and this Council affirms it to be most <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, that the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> which a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> pronounces upon one over whom he has not either ordinary or delegated <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, is of no effect" (Council of Trent, Sess. XIV, c. 7). Ordinary <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is that which one has by reason of his office as involving the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> has it over the whole <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> within his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> within his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>. Delegated <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is that which is granted by an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior to one who does not possess it by virtue of his office. The need of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> for administering this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is usually expressed by saying that a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> must have "faculties" to hear confession (see FACULTIES). Hence it is that a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> visiting in a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> other than his own cannot hear confession without special authorization from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Every <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, however, can <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> anyone who is at the point of death, because under those circumstances the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> gives all <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. As the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> grants <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, he can also limit it by "reserving" certain cases (see <a href="12784a.htm">RESERVATION</a>) and he can even withdraw it entirely.</p>

<h3>Recipient (i.e., the penitent)</h3>

<p>The Sacrament of Penance was instituted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> for the remission of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Hence, no unbaptized <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>, however deep and sincere his sorrow, can be validly <a href="01061a.htm">absolved</a>. <a href="02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, in other words, is the first <a href="05543b.htm">essential</a> requisite on the part of the penitent. This does not imply that in the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> committed by an unbaptized <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> there is a special enormity or any other element that places them beyond the <a href="08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>; but that one must first be a member of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> before he can submit himself and his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> to the judicial process of <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> Penance.</p>

<h3>Contrition and attrition</h3>

<p>Without sorrow for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> there is no forgiveness. Hence the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIV, c. 4): "Contrition, which holds the first place among the acts of the penitent, is sorrow of heart and detestation for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> committed, with the resolve to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> no more". The Council (<em>ibid.</em>) furthermore distinguishes perfect <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a> from imperfect <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a>, which is called <a href="02065a.htm">attrition</a>, and which arises from the consideration of the turpitude of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> or from the <a href="06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> and punishment. See <a href="02065a.htm">ATTRITION</a>; <a href="04337a.htm">CONTRITION</a>, where these two kinds of sorrow are more fully explained and an account is given of the principal discussions and opinions. See also treatises by <a href="11739b.htm">Pesch</a>, <a href="11430c.htm">Palmieri</a>, Pohle. For the present purpose it need only be stated that <a href="02065a.htm">attrition</a>, with the Sacrament of Penance, suffices to obtain forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> further teaches (<em>ibid.</em>): "though it sometimes happens that this <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a> is perfect and that it reconciles <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> before the actual reception of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, still the reconciliation is not to be ascribed to the <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a> itself apart from the desire of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> which it (<a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a>) includes". In accordance with this teaching <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> condemned (1567) the proposition of <a href="02209c.htm">Baius</a> asserting that even perfect <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a> does not, except in case of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> or of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, remit <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> without the actual reception of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchir.", 1071). It should be noted, however, that the <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a> of which the Council speaks is perfect in the sense that it includes the desire (<em>votum</em>) to receive the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Whoever in fact repents of his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> out of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> must be willing to comply with the Divine ordinance regarding penance, i.e., he would confess if a confessor were accessible, and he realizes that he is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confess when he has the opportunity. But it does not follow that the penitent is at liberty to choose between two modes of obtaining forgiveness, one by an <a href="01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a> independently of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, the other by confession and <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>. This view was put forward by Peter Martinez (de Osma) in the proposition: "mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> as regards their guilt and their punishment in the other world, are blotted out by <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a> alone without any reference to the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a>"; and the proposition was condemned by <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> in 1479 (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchir.", 724). Hence it is clear that not even heartfelt sorrow based on the highest motives, can, in the present order of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, dispense with the <a href="08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, i.e., with the Sacrament of Penance.</p>

<h3>Confession (necessity)</h3>

<p>"For those who after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> have fallen into <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, the Sacrament of Penance is as <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> unto <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> as is <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself for those who have not yet been <a href="12714a.htm">regenerated</a>" (<a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, Sess. XIV, c. 2). Penance, therefore, is not an institution the use of which was left to the option of each sinner so that he might, if he preferred, hold aloof from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and secure forgiveness by some other means, e.g., by acknowledging his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> in the privacy of his own <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>. As already stated, the power granted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> is twofold, to forgive and to retain, in such a way that what they forgive <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> forgives and what they retain <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> retains. But this grant would be nullified if, in case the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> retained the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> of penitent, he could, as it were, take appeal to <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> tribunal and obtain pardon. Nor would the power to retain have any meaning if the sinner, passing over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, went in the first instance to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, since by the very terms of the grant, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> retains <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> once committed so long as it is not remitted by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. It would indeed have been strangely inconsistent if <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> in conferring this twofold power on the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> had intended to provide some other means of forgiveness such as confessing "to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone". Not only the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, but any one with an elementary <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> would have perceived at once that the easier means would be chosen and that the grant of power so formally and solemnly made by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> had no real significance (Palmieri, op. cit., thesis X). On the other hand, once it is admitted that the grant was effectual and consequently that the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to obtain forgiveness, it plainly follows that the penitent must in some way make known his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> to those who exercise the power. This is conceded even by those who reject the Sacrament of Penance as a Divine institution. "Such remission was manifestly impossible without the declaration of the offences to be forgiven" (Lea, "History etc.", I, p. 182). The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, after declaring that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> left his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> as His <a href="15401a.htm">vicars</a> unto whom as rulers and judges the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> must make known their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, adds: "It is evident that the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> could not have exercised this judgment without <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a>, nor could they have observed <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> in enjoining satisfaction if (the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>) had declared their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> in a general way only and not specifically and in detail" (Sess. XIV, c. 5).</p>

<p>Since the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in the pardoning of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> exercises a strict judicial function, <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> must will that such tremendous power be used wisely and prudently. Moreover, in virtue of the grant of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> can forgive all <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> without distinction, <em>quoecumque solveritis</em>. How can a wise and <a href="12517b.htm">prudent</a> judgment be rendered if the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> be in <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a> on which judgment is pronounced? And how can he obtain the requisite <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> unless it come from the spontaneous acknowledgment of the sinner? This <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of manifestation is all the clearer if satisfaction for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, which from the beginning has been part of the <a href="11618b.htm">penitential</a> <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a>, is to be imposed not only wisely but also <a href="08571c.htm">justly</a>. That there is a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection between the <a href="12517b.htm">prudent</a> judgment of the confessor and the detailed confession of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> is evident from the nature of a judicial procedure and especially from a full <a href="01450a.htm">analysis</a> of the grant of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the light of <a href="15006b.htm">tradition</a>. No judge may release or condemn without full <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the case. And again the <a href="15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the earliest <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> sees in the words of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> not only the office of the judge sitting in judgment, but the kindness of a father who weeps with the repentant child (<a href="01593c.htm">Aphraates</a>, "Ep. de Poenitentia", dem. 7) and the skill of the physician who after the manner of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> heals the wounds of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> in P.G., XII, 418; P.L., XII, 1086). Clearly, therefore, the words of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> imply the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the external <a href="09597a.htm">manifestation of conscience</a> to a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in order to obtain pardon.</p>

<h3>Confession (various kinds)</h3>

<p>Confession is the avowal of one's own <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> made to a duly authorized <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> for the purpose of obtaining their forgiveness through the <a href="08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>. Virtual confession is simply the will to confess even where, owing to circumstances, declaration of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is impossible; actual confession is any action by which the penitent manifests his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. It may be made in general terms, e.g., by reciting the "Confiteor", or it may consist in a more or less detailed statement of one's <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>; when the statement is complete, the confession is distinct. Public confession, as made in the hearing of a number of people (e.g. a congregation) differs from private, or secret, confession which is made to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> alone and is often called <em>auricular</em>, i.e., spoken into the ear of the confessor. We are here concerned mainly with <a href="01124a.htm">actual</a> distinct confession which is the usual practice in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and which so far as the validity of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is concerned, may be either public or private. "As regards the method of confessing secretly to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> alone, though <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not forbid that any one, in punishment of his crimes and for his own humiliation as also to give others an example and to edify the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, should confess his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> publicly, still, this has not been commanded by <a href="09071a.htm">Divine precept</a> nor would it be <a href="12517b.htm">prudent</a> to <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> by any <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> that <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, especially secret <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, should be publicly confessed. Since, then, secret <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> confession, which from the beginning has been and even now is the usage of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, was always commended with great and unanimous <a href="04283a.htm">consent</a> by the holiest and most ancient Fathers; thereby is plainly refuted the foolish <a href="03190c.htm">calumny</a> of those who make bold to teach that it (secret confession) is something foreign to the Divine command, a <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> invention devised by the Fathers assembled in the Lateran Council" (<a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, Sess. XIV, c. 5). It is therefore <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, first, that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not prescribe public confession, salutary as it might be, nor did He forbid it; second, that secret confession, <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> in character, has been the practice of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> from the earliest days.</p>

<h3>Traditional belief and practice</h3>

<p>How firmly rooted in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> is the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in the efficacy and <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of confession, appears clearly from the fact that the Sacrament of Penance endures in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> after the countless attacks to which it has been subjected during the last four centuries. If at the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> or since the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> could have surrendered a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> or abandoned a practice for the sake of peace and to soften a "hard saying", confession would have been the first to disappear. Yet it is precisely during this period that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has <a href="04675b.htm">defined</a> in the most exact terms the <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> of penance and most vigorously insisted on the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of confession. It will not of course be denied that at the beginning of the sixteenth century confession was generally practised throughout the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. The <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> themselves, notably <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, admitted that it had been in existence for three centuries when they attributed its origin to the <a href="09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215). At that <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, according to Lea (op. cit., I, 228), the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of confession "became a new <a href="01755d.htm">article of faith</a>" and the canon, <em>omnis utriusque sexus</em>, "is perhaps the most important legislative act in the <a href="07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>" (<em>ibid.</em>, 230). But, as the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> affirms, "the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> did not through the Lateran Council prescribe that the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful of Christ</a> should confess &#151; a thing which it <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> to be by Divine right <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> and established &#151; but that the <a href="12372b.htm">precept</a> of confessing at least once a year should be complied with by all and every one when they reached the <a href="01209a.htm">age of discretion</a>" (Sess., XIV, c. 5). The Lateran edict presupposed the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of confession as an article of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> and laid down a <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> as to the minimum frequency of confession &#151; at least once a year.</p>

<h3>In the Middle Ages</h3>

<p>In constructing their systems of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> discuss at length the various problems connected with the Sacrament of Penance. They are practically unanimous in holding that confession is <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a>; the only notable exception in the twelfth century is Gratian, who gives the arguments for and against the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of confessing to a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and leaves the question open (Decretum, p. II, De poen., d. 1, in P.L., CLXXXVII, 1519-63). <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (d. about 1150) takes up the authorities cited by Gratian and by means of them <a href="12454c.htm">proves</a> that "without confession there is no pardon" . . . "no entrance into <a href="14519a.htm">paradise</a>" (IV Sent., d. XVII, 4, in P.L., CXCII, 880-2). The principal debate, in which <a href="07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, <a href="12563a.htm">Robert Pullus</a>, and <a href="11773b.htm">Peter of Poitiers</a> took the leading parts, concerned the origin and <a href="13428a.htm">sanction</a> of the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and the value of the different <a href="13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> texts cited to <a href="12454c.htm">prove</a> the institution of penance. This question passed on to the thirteenth century and received its solution in very plain terms from <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. Treating (Contra Gentes, IV, 72) of the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of penance and its parts, he shows that "the institution of confession was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order that the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> of the penitent might be revealed to <a href="10326a.htm">Christ's minister</a>; hence the <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> to whom the confession is made must have judicial power as representing <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Judge of the living and the dead. This power again requires two things: authority of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and power to <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> or to condemn. These are called the two <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> which the Lord entrusted to Peter (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs19">Matthew 16:19</a>). But they were not given to Peter to be held by him alone, but to be handed on through him to others; else sufficient provision would not have been made for the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. These <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> derive their efficacy from the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11327b.htm">passion of Christ</a> whereby He opened to us the gate of the <a href="08646a.htm">heavenly kingdom</a>". And he adds that as no one can be <a href="13407a.htm">saved</a> without <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> either by actual reception or by desire, so they who <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> cannot be <a href="13407a.htm">saved</a> unless they submit to the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> either by actually confessing or by the resolve to confess when opportunity permits. Furthermore, as the rulers of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot dispense any one from <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> as a means of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> neither can they give a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> whereby the sinner may be forgiven without confession and <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>. The same explanation and reasoning is given by all the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. They were in practical agreement as to the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the confessor. Regarding the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> at which confession had to be made, some held with <a href="15631c.htm">William of Auvergne</a> that one was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confess as soon as possible after <a href="14004b.htm">sinning</a>; others with <a href="01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> and <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> that it sufficed to confess within the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> limits prescribed by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="05224d.htm">Paschal Time</a>); and this more lenient view finally prevailed. Further subjects of discussion during this period were the choice of confessor; the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of confessing before receiving other <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, especially the Eucharist; the integrity of confession; the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of secrecy on the part of the confessor, i.e., the <a href="13649b.htm">seal of confession</a>. The careful and minute treatment of these points and the frank expression of divergent opinions were characteristic of the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> but they also brought out more clearly the central <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> regarding penance and they opened the way to the <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> pronouncements at Florence and Trent which gave to <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> a more precise formulation. See Vacandard and Bernard in "Dict. de theol. cath.", s.v. Confession; Turmel, "Hist. de la th&eacute;ologie positive", Paris, 1904; Cambier, "De divina institutione confessionis sacramentalis", Louvain, 1884.</p>

<p>Not only was the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> recognized in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, but the <a href="11329a.htm">schismatic Greeks</a> held the same <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> and still hold it. They fell into <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> under <a href="12043b.htm">Photius</a> in 869, but retained confession, which therefore must have been in use for some time previous to the ninth century. The practice, moreover, was regulated in detail by the Penitential Books, which prescribed the canonical penance for each <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and minute questions for the <a href="05673a.htm">examination</a> of the penitent. The most famous of these books among the Greeks were those attributed to <a href="08493a.htm">John the Faster</a> and to John the Monk. In the West similar works were written by the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> <a href="04137a.htm">St. Columbanus</a> (d. 615) and Cummian, and by the <a href="05431b.htm">Englishmen</a> <a href="02384a.htm">Ven. Bede</a> (d. 735), Egbert (d. 767), and <a href="14571a.htm">Theodore of Canterbury</a> (d. 690). Besides the councils mentioned above (<em>Minister</em>) <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> pertaining to confession were enacted at Worms (868), <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (820), <a href="03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a> (813, 650), <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a> (813), <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> (1113). The Council of Chaleuth (785) says: "if any one (which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) should depart this life without penance or confession he is not to be <a href="04653a.htm">prayed</a> for". The significant feature about these enactments is that they do not introduce confession as a new practice, but take it for granted and regulate its administration. Hereby they put into practical effect what had been handed down by <a href="15006b.htm">tradition</a>.</p>

<p><a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (d. 604) teaches "the affliction of penance is efficacious in blotting out <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> when it is enjoined by the <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> when the burden of it is decided by him in proportion to the offence after weighing the deeds of those who confess" (In I Reg., III, v, n. 13 in P.L., LXXIX, 207); <a href="09154b.htm">Pope Leo the Great</a> (440-61), who is often credited with the institution of confession, refers to it as an "Apostolic rule". Writing to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Campania he forbids as an abuse "contrary to the <a href="01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> rule" (<em>contra apostolicam regulam</em>) the reading out in public of a written statement of their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> drawn up by the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, because, he declares, "it suffices that the guilt of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> be manifested to <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> alone in secret confession" (Ep. clxviii in P.L., LIV, 1210). In another letter (<a href="../fathers/3604108.htm">Epistle 108</a>), after declaring that by Divine ordinance the mercy of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> can be obtained only through the supplications of the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, he adds: "the mediator between <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, gave the rulers of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> this power that they should impose penance on those who confess and admit them when purified by salutary satisfaction to the communion of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> through the gateway of reconciliation. "The earlier Fathers frequently speak of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> as a disease which needs treatment, something drastic, at the hands of the spiritual physician or surgeon. <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (d. 450) tells the sinner: "an abscess had formed in your <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>; it tormented you and gave you no rest. . . . confess, and in confession let the pus come out and flow away" (<a href="../fathers/1801066.htm"><em>Enarration on Psalm 66</em>, no. 6</a>). <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (d. 420) comparing the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the New Law with those of the Old who decided between <a href="09182a.htm">leprosy</a> and <a href="09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, says: "likewise in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> bind or loose . . . in virtue of their office", having heard various sorts of sinners, they <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> who is to be bound and who is to be loosed" . . . (In Matt., xvi, 19); in his "Sermon on Penance" he says: "let no one find it irksome to show his wound <em>vulnus confiteri</em>) because without confession it cannot be healed." <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (d. 397): "this <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> (of loosing and binding) has been conferred on <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> only" (<a href="../fathers/34061.htm"><em>On Penance</em> I.2.7</a>); <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (d. 397): "As <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> do not make known their bodily ailments to anybody and everybody, but only to those who are skilled in healing, so confession of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> ought to be made to those who can cure it" (Reg. brevior., 229).</p>

<p>For those who sought to escape the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of confession it was natural enough to assert that repentance was the affair of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> alone with its <a href="06608a.htm">Maker</a>, and that no intermediary was needed. It is this pretext that <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> sweeps aside in one of his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>: "Let no one say I do penance secretly; I perform it in the sight of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and He who is to pardon me knows that in my heart I repent". Whereupon St. Augustine asks: "Was it then said to no purpose, 'What you shall loose upon earth shall be loosed in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>?' Was it for nothing that the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> were given to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>?" (Sermo cccxcii, n. 3, in P.L., XXXIX, 1711). The Fathers, of course, do not deny that <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> must be confessed to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; at times, indeed, in exhorting the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> to confess, they make no mention of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>; but such passages must be taken in connection with the general teaching of the Fathers and with the <a href="15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Their real meaning is expressed, e.g., by <a href="01455d.htm">Anastasius Sinaita</a> (seventh century): "Confess your <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> through the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>" (De sacra synaxi), and by <a href="05326a.htm">Egbert</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15733b.htm">York</a> (d. 766): "Let the sinner confess his <a href="14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, that the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> may <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> what penance to impose" (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc., XII, 232). For the passages in <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, see <a href="07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, "Theol. dogmat.", III, 454; <a href="11739b.htm">Pesch</a>, "Praelectiones", VII, 165.</p>

<p>The Fathers, knowing well that one great difficulty which the sinner has to overcome is shame, encourage him in spite of it to confess. "I appeal to you, my brethren", says St. Pacian (d. 391), ". . . you who are not ashamed to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and yet are ashamed to confess . . . I beseech you, cease to hide your wounded <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Sick people who are <a href="12517b.htm">prudent</a> do not fear the physician, though he cut and burn even the secret parts of the body" (Paraenesis ad poenit., n. 6, 8). <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (d. 347) pleads eloquently with the sinner: "Be not ashamed to approach (the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>) because you have <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a>, nay rather, for this very reason approach. No one says: Because I have an ulcer, I will not go near a physician or take medicine; on the contrary, it is just this that makes it needful to call in physicians and apply remedies. We (priests) <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> well how to pardon, because we ourselves are liable to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. This is why <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> did not give us <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> to be our <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>, nor send down Gabriel to rule the flock, but from the fold itself he chooses the shepherds, from among the sheep He appoints the leader, in order that he may be inclined to pardon his followers and, keeping in mind his own fault, may not set himself in hardness against the members of the flock" (Hom. "On Frequent Assembly" in P.G., LXIII, 463).</p>

<p><a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> had already used the same argument with those who, for <a href="06021a.htm">fear</a> of exposing their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, put off their confession from day to day &#151; "mindful more of their shame than of their <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, like those who hide from the physician the malady they suffer in the secret parts of the body, and thus perish through bashfulness. . . . because we withhold anything from the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>, do we thereby conceal it from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>? . . . Is it better to hide and be damned than to be openly <a href="01061a.htm">absolved</a>?" (<a href="../fathers/0320.htm"><em>On Penance</em> 10</a>). <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (d. 258) pleads for greater mildness in the treatment of sinners, "since we find that no one ought to be forbidden to do penance and that to those who implore the mercy of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> peace can be granted through His <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. . . . And because in <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> there is no confession, nor can <em>exomologesis</em> be made there, they who repent with their whole heart and ask for it, should be received into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and therein <a href="13407a.htm">saved</a> unto the Lord" (<a href="../fathers/050651.htm">Epistle 51, no. 29</a>). Elsewhere he says that many who do not do penance or confess their guilt are filled with unclean spirits; and by contrast he praises the greater <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and more wholesome <a href="06021a.htm">fear</a> of those who, though not guilty of any <a href="07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> action, "nevertheless, because they thought of [such action], confess [their thought] in sorrow and simplicity to the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, make the <em>exomologesis</em> of their <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, lay bare the burden of their <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, and seek a salutary remedy even for wounds that are slight" (<a href="../fathers/050703.htm"><em>De Lapsis</em> 26 sqq.</a>). <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (d. 154) compares the sinner to those whose stomachs are overloaded with undigested food or with excess of humours and phlegm if they vomit, they are relieved, "so, too, those who have <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a>, if they conceal and keep the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> within, they are distressed and almost choked by its humour or phlegm. But if they accuse themselves and confess, they at the same time vomit the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and cast off every cause of disease" (Homil. on Ps. xxxvii, n. 6, in P.G., XII, 1386). <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> (130-102) relates the case of certain <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> whom the <a href="09650b.htm">Gnostic Marcus</a> had led into <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. "Some of them", he says, "perform their <em>exomologesis</em> openly also [<em>etiam in manifesto</em>], while others, afraid to do this, draw back in silence, <a href="04755a.htm">despairing</a> to regain the life of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../fathers/0103113.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.13.7</a>). This <em>etiam in manifesto</em> suggests at least that they had confessed privately, but could not bring themselves to make a public confession. The advantage of confession as against the concealment of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is shown in the words of <a href="04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a> in his letter to the Corinthians: "It is better for a man to confess his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> than to harden his heart" (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm">Epistle 1, no. 51.1</a>).</p>

<p>This outline of the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> teaching shows:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>that the Fathers insisted on a manifestation of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> as the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of unburdening the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and regaining the friendship of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>;</li><li>that the confession was to be made not to a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> but to <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>;</li><li>that <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> exercise the power of <a href="01061a.htm">absolving</a> in virtue of a Divine commission, i.e., as representatives of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>;</li><li>that the sinner, if he would be <a href="13407a.htm">saved</a>, must overcome his shame and repugnance to confession.</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>And since the series of <a href="15677a.htm">witnesses</a> goes back to the latter part of the first century, the practice of confession must have existed from the earliest days. <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> had good reason for appealing to the "Apostolic rule" which made secret confession to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> sufficient without the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of a public declaration. Nor is it surprising that <a href="08736a.htm">Lactantius</a> (d. c. 330) should have pointed to the practice of confession as a characteristic of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>: "That is the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in which there is confession and penance, which applies a wholesome remedy to the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and wounds whereunto the weakness of the flesh is subject" (<a href="../fathers/07014.htm"><em>Divine Institutes</em> IV.30</a>).</p>

<h2>What sins are to be confessed</h2>

<p>Among the propositions condemned by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> is the following: "That to obtain forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> in the Sacrament of Penance, it is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> by <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a> to confess each and every mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> which is called to <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> by due and careful <a href="05675a.htm">examination</a>, to confess even hidden <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and those that are against the last two <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>, together with the circumstances that change the specific nature of the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>; such confession is only useful for the instruction and consolation of the penitent, and of old was practised merely in order to impose canonical satisfaction" (Can de poenit., vii). The <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> consequently is: that all mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> must be confessed of which the penitent is <a href="04274a.htm">conscious</a>, for these are so related that no one of them can be remitted until all are remitted. <em>Remission</em> means that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is restored to the friendship of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; and this is obviously impossible if there remain unforgiven even a single mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. Hence, the penitent, who in confession willfully conceals a mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, derives no benefit whatever; on the contrary, he makes void the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and thereby incurs the guilt of <a href="13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>. If, however, the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> be omitted, not through any fault of the penitent, but through forgetfulness, it is forgiven indirectly; but it must be declared at the next confession and thus submitted to the <a href="08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>.</p>

<p>While mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> of confession, venial <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is sufficient <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a>, as are also the mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> already forgiven in previous confessions. This is the common teaching of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, in accord with the condemnation pronounced by <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> on <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> assertion, 'By no means presume to confess venial <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> . . . in the primitive <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> only manifest mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> were confessed" (<a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Exurge Domine"; <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchir.", 748). In the constitution "Inter cunctas" (17 Feb., 1304), <a href="02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, after stating that penitents who had confessed to a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> belonging to a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order are not <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to reiterate the confession to their own <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, adds: "Though it is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to confess the same <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> over again, nevertheless we regard it as salutary to repeat the confession, because of the shame it involves, which is a great part of penance; hence we strictly enjoin the <a href="09093a.htm">Brothers</a> (<a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>] to admonish their penitents and in <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> 'exhort them that they confess to their own <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> at least once a year, assuring them that this will undoubtedly conduce to their spiritual welfare" (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchir.", 470). <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> gives the same reason for this practice: the oftener one confesses the more is the (temporal) penalty reduced; hence one might confess over and over again until the whole penalty is cancelled, nor would he thereby offer any injury to the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>" (IV Sent., d. xvii, q. 3, sol. 5 ad 4).</p>

<h2>Satisfaction</h2>

<p>As stated above, the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> given by the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> to a penitent who confesses his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> with the proper dispositions remits both the guilt and the <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment (of mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>). There remains, however, some <a href="04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> to Divine <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> which must be cancelled here or hereafter (see <a href="12575a.htm">PURGATORY</a>). In order to have it cancelled here, the penitent receives from his confessor what is usually called his "penance", usually in the form of certain <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> which he is to say, or of certain actions which he is to perform, such as visits to a church, the <a href="15569a.htm">Stations of the Cross</a>, etc. <a href="01328f.htm">Alms deeds</a>, <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> are the chief means of satisfaction, but other penitential works may also be enjoined. The quality and extent of the penance is determined by the confessor according to the nature of the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> revealed, the special circumstances of the penitent, his liability to relapse, and the need of eradicating <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> habits. Sometimes the penance is such that it may be performed at once; in other cases it may require a more or less considerable period, as, e.g., where it is prescribed for each day during a week or a month. But even then the penitent may receive another <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> (e.g., <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>) immediately after confession, since <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> restores him to the state of grace. He is nevertheless under <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to continue the performance of his penance until it is completed.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> language, this penance is called satisfaction and is defined, in the words of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>: "The payment of the temporal punishment due on account of the offence committed against <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../summa/5012.htm#article3"><em>Summa Theologic&aelig;</em> Supplement.12.3</a>). It is an <a href="01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> whereby the injury done to the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is required, so far at least as the sinner is able to make <a href="12775a.htm">reparation</a> (<em>poena vindicativa</em>); it is also a preventive remedy, inasmuch as it is meant to hinder the further commission of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> (<em>poena medicinalis</em>). Satisfaction is not, like <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a> and confession, an <a href="05543b.htm">essential</a> part of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, because the primary effect, i.e., remission of guilt and <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment &#151; is obtained without satisfaction; but it is an integral part, because it is requisite for obtaining the secondary effect &#151; i.e., remission of the temporal punishment. The <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on this point is set forth by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which condemns the proposition: "That the entire punishment is always remitted by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> together with the guilt, and the satisfaction required of penitents is no other than <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby they <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> has satisfied for them"; and further the proposition: "That the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> were given to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> for loosing only and not for binding as well; that therefore in enjoining penance on those who confess, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="01115a.htm">act</a> contrary to the purpose of the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a> and the institution of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>; that it is a fiction [to say] that after the <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment has been remitted in virtue of the <a href="08631b.htm">keys</a>, there usually remains to be paid a temporal penalty" (Can. "de Sac. poenit.", 12, 15; <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchir.", 922, 925).</p>

<p>As against the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> contained in these statements, the Council (Sess. XIV, c. viii) cites conspicuous examples from <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The most notable of these is the judgment pronounced upon <a href="04642b.htm">David</a>: "And <a href="10711a.htm">Nathan</a> said to <a href="04642b.htm">David</a>: the Lord also hath taken away thy <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>: thou shalt not die. Nevertheless, because thou hast given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to <a href="02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>, for this thing, the child that is born to thee, shall surely die" (<a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#vrs13">2 Samuel 12:13, 14</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs17">Genesis 3:17</a>; <a href="../bible/num020.htm#vrs11">Numbers 20:11 sqq.</a>). <a href="04642b.htm">David's</a> <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> was forgiven and yet he had to suffer punishment in the loss of his child. The same <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> is taught by <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs32">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>): "But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world". The chastisement here mentioned is a temporal punishment, but a punishment unto <a href="13407a.htm">Salvation</a>.</p>

<p>"Of all the parts of penance", says the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (loc. cit.), "satisfaction was constantly recommended to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> people by our Fathers". This the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> themselves admitted. <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a> (Instit., III, iv, 38) says he makes little account of what the ancient writings contain in regard to satisfaction because "nearly all whose books are extant went astray on this point or spoke too severely". Chemnitius ("Examen C. Trident.", 4) acknowledges that <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, and Augustine extolled the value of penitential works; and Flacius Illyricus, in the "Centuries", has a long list of Fathers and early writers who, as he admits, bear witness to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of satisfaction. Some of the texts already cited (Confession) expressly mention satisfaction as a part of <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> penance. To these may be added <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who says that "<a href="09580c.htm">Man</a> is forced to suffer even after his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, though it was <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> that brought down on him this penalty. For the punishment outlasts the guilt, lest the guilt should be thought slight if with its forgiveness the punishment also came to an end" (<a href="../fathers/1701124.htm"><em>Tractate 124 on the Gospel of John</em>, no. 5</a>); <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>: "So efficacious is the medicine of penance that [in view of it] <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> seems to <a href="13007a.htm">revoke</a> His <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a>" (<a href="../fathers/34062.htm"><em>On Penance</em> II.6.48</a>); <a href="03135b.htm">Caesarius of Arles</a>: "If in tribulation we give not thanks to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> nor <a href="12677d.htm">redeem</a> our faults by good <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, we shall be detained in the fire of <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a> until our slightest <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> are burned away like wood or straw" (Sermo civ, n. 4). Among the motives for doing penance on which the Fathers most frequently insist is this: If you punish your own <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> will spare you; but in any case the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> will not go unpunished. Or again they declare that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> wants us to perform satisfaction in order that we may clear off our <a href="04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> to His <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. It is therefore with good reason that the earlier councils &#151; e.g., Laodicaea (A.D. 372) and Carthage IV (397) &#151; teach that satisfaction is to be imposed on penitents; and the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> but reiterates the <a href="15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> and practice when it makes the giving of "penance" <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on the confessor. Hence, too, the practice of granting <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, whereby the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> comes to the penitent's assistance and places at his disposal the treasury of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="10202b.htm">merits</a>. Though closely connected with penance, <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are not a part of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; they presuppose confession and <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>, and are properly called an extra-sacramental remission of the temporal punishment incurred by <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. (See <a href="07783a.htm">INDULGENCES</a>.)</p>

<h2>Seal of confession</h2>

<p>Regarding the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> revealed to him in <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> confession, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is bound to <a href="13649b.htm">inviolable secrecy</a>. From this <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> he cannot be excused either to save his own life or <a href="12776c.htm">good name</a>, to save the life of another, to further the ends of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, or to avert any public calamity. No <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> can compel him to divulge the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> confessed to him, or any <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> which he takes &#151; e.g., as a <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> in court. He cannot reveal them either directly &#151; i.e., by repeating them in so many words &#151; or indirectly &#151; i.e., by any sign or action, or by giving information based on what he knows through confession. The only possible release from the obligation of secrecy is the permission to speak of the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> given freely and formally by the penitent himself. Without such permission, the violation of the <a href="13649b.htm">seal of confession</a> would not only be a grievous <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also a <a href="13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>. It would be contrary to the <a href="09076a.htm">natural law</a> because it would be an abuse of the penitent's confidence and an injury, very serious perhaps, to his <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a>. It would also violate the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, which, while imposing the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to confess, likewise forbids the revelation of that which is confessed. That it would infringe ecclesiastical law is evident from the strict prohibition and the severe penalties enacted in this matter by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. "Let him beware of betraying the sinner by word or sign or in any other way whatsoever. . . we <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> that he who dares to reveal a <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> made <a href="08673a.htm">known</a> to him in the tribunal of penance shall not only be <a href="04737b.htm">deposed</a> from the <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, but shall moreover be subjected to close confinement in a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and the performance of perpetual penance" (<a href="09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a>, cap. xxi; <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchir.", 438). Furthermore, by a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Holy Office (18 Nov., 1682), confessors are forbidden, even where there would be no revelation direct or indirect, to make any use of the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> obtained in confession that would displease the penitent, even though the non-use would occasion him greater displeasure.</p>

<p>These prohibitions, as well as the general <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of secrecy, apply only to what the confessor learns through confession made as part of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. He is not bound by the <a href="13649b.htm">seal</a> as regards what may be told him by a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who, he is sure, has no <a href="08069b.htm">intention</a> of making a <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> confession but merely speaks to him "in confidence"; <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a>, however, may impose silence concerning what he learns in this way. Nor does the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the <a href="13649b.htm">seal</a> prevent the confessor from speaking of things which he has learned outside confession, though the same things have also been told him in confession; here again, however, other reasons may <a href="11189a.htm">oblige</a> him to observe secrecy. The same <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, with the limitations indicated, rests upon all those who in one way or another acquire a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is said in confession, e.g., an interpreter who translates for the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> the words of the penitent, a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who either accidentally or intentionally overhears the confession, an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior (e.g., a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>) to whom the confessor applies for authorization to <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> the penitent from a <a href="12785a.htm">reserved case</a>. Even the penitent, according to some <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, is bound to secrecy; but the more general opinion leaves him free; as he can authorize the confessor to speak of what he has confessed, he can also, of his own accord, speak to others. But he is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take care that what he reveals shall cast no blame or suspicion on the confessor, since the latter cannot defend himself. In a word, it is more in keeping with the <a href="08069b.htm">intention</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and with the reverence due to the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that the penitent himself should refrain from speaking of his confession. Such, undoubtedly, was the motive that prompted <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> to condemn the practice of letting the penitent read in public a written statement of his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> (see above); and it needs scarcely be added that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, while recognizing the validity of public confession, by no means requires it; as the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declares, it would be imprudent to prescribe such a confession by any <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> enactment. (For provisions of the <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> regarding this matter, see <a href="13649b.htm">SEAL OF CONFESSION</a>.)</p>

<h2>Public penance</h2>

<p>An undeniable <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> both of the practice of confession and of the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of satisfaction is found in the usage of the early <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> according to which severe and often prolonged penance was prescribed and performed. The elaborate system of penance exhibited in the <a href="11636a.htm">"Penitentials"</a> and <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a>, referred to above, was of course the outcome of a long development; but it simply expressed in greater detail the principles and the general attitude towards <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and satisfaction which had prevailed from the beginning. Frequently enough the latter <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> refer to the earlier practice either in explicit terms or by reiterating what had been enacted long before. At times, also, they allude to documents which were then extant, but which have not yet come down to us, e.g., the <em>libellus</em> mentioned in the <a href="01199a.htm">African synods</a> of 251 and 255 as containing <em>singula capitum placita</em>, i.e., the details of previous legislation (<a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, <a href="../fathers/050621.htm"><em>Epistle 21</em></a>). Or again, they point to a system of penance that was already in operation and needed only to be applied to particular cases, like that of the Corinthians to whom <a href="04012c.htm">Clement of Rome</a> wrote his <a href="../fathers/1010.htm">First Epistle</a> about A.D. 96, exhorting them: "Be subject in obedience to the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> (<em>presbyteris</em>) and receive <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> [<em>correctionem</em>) unto penance, bending the knees of your hearts" (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle to the Corinthians</em> 57</a>). At the close, therefore, of the first century, the performance of penance was required, and the nature of that penance was determined, not by the penitent himself, but by <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authority</a>. (See <a href="05678a.htm">EXCOMMUNICATION</a>.)</p>

<p>Three kinds of penance are to be distinguished canonical, prescribed by councils or <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the form of "canons" for graver offences. This might be either private, i.e., performed secretly or public i.e., performed in the presence of <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. When accompanied by certain <a href="13064b.htm">rites</a> as prescribed in the Canons, it was <a href="14133a.htm">solemn</a> penance. The public penance was not necessarily canonical; it might be undertaken by the penitent of his own accord. Solemn penance, the most severe of all, was inflicted for the worst offences only, notably for <a href="01163a.htm">adultery</a>, <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a>, and <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, the "capital <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>". The name of <em>penitent</em> was applied especially to those who performed public canonical penance. "There is a harder and more grievous penance, the doers of which are properly called in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> <em>penitents</em>; they are excluded from participation in the <a href="05584a.htm">sacraments of the altar</a>, lest by unworthily receiving they eat and drink judgment unto themselves "(St. Augustine, "De utilitate agendae poenit.", ser. cccxxxii, c. iii).</p>

<p>The <a href="11618b.htm">penitential</a> process included a series of acts, the first of which was confession. Regarding this, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, after speaking of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, tells us: "There is a yet more severe and arduous pardon of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> by penance, when the sinner washes his couch with tears, and when he blushes not to disclose his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Lord and seeks the remedy" (Homil. "In Levit.", ii, 4, in P.G., XII, 418). Again he says: "They who have <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a>, if they hide and retain their <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> within their breast, are grievously tormented; but if the sinner becomes his own accuser, while he does this, he discharges the <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a> of all his malady. Only let him carefully consider to whom he should confess his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>; what is the character of the physician; if he be one who will be weak with the weak, who will weep with the sorrowful, and who understands the <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> of condolence and fellow-feeling. So that when his skill shall be <a href="08673a.htm">known</a> and his pity felt, you may follow what he shall advise. Should he think your disease to be such that it should be declared in the assembly of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>&mdash;whereby others may be edified, and yourself easily reformed&mdash;this must be done with much deliberation and the skillful advice of the physician" (Homil. "In Ps. xxxvii", n. 6, in P.G., XII, 1386). <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> here states quite plainly the relation between confession and public penance. The sinner must first make <a href="08673a.htm">known</a> his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, who will decide whether any further manifestation is called for.</p>

<p>Public penance did not necessarily include a public avowal of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. As <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> also declares, "If his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is not only grievous in itself, but involves <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> given to others, and if the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> [<em>antistes</em>] judges that it will be useful to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> [to have the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> published], let not the sinner refuse to do penance in the sight of many or even of the people at large, let him not resist, nor through shame add to his mortal wound a greater <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>" (Sermo cli, n. 3). It was therefore the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of the confessor to determine how far the process of penance should go beyond <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> confession. It lay with him also to fix the <a href="12589c.htm">quality</a> and duration of the penance: "Satisfaction", says <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "is determined by confession; penance is born of confession, and by penance <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is appeased" (<a href="../fathers/0320.htm"><em>On Penance</em> 8</a>). In the East there existed from the earliest times (<a href="14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/26027.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.16</a>) or at least from the outbreak of the <a href="11138a.htm">Novatianist</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> (<a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26015.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.19</a>) a functionary known as <em>presbyter penitentiarius</em>, i.e., a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> especially appointed on account of his <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and reserve to hear confessions and impose public penance. If the confessor deemed it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, he <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> the penitent to appear before the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his council [<em>presbyterium</em>) and these again decided whether the crime was of such a nature that it ought to be confessed in presence of the people. Then followed, usually on <a href="01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>, the imposition of public penance whereby the sinner was excluded for a longer or shorter period from the communion of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and in addition was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to perform certain penitential exercises, the <em>exomologesis</em>. This term, however, had various meanings: it designated sometimes the entire process of penance (<a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>), or again the avowal of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> at the beginning or, finally, the public avowal which was made at the end &#151; i.e., after the performance of the penitential exercises.</p>

<p>The nature of these exercises varied according to the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> for which they were prescribed. According to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0320.htm"><em>On Penance</em> 9</a>), "<em>Exomologesis</em> is the <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> which <a href="11189a.htm">obliges</a> a man to prostrate and humiliate himself and to adopt a manner of life that will draw down mercy. As regards dress and food, it prescribes that he shall lie in <a href="07113b.htm">sackcloth</a> and <a href="01776c.htm">ashes</a>, clothe his body in rags, plunge his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> in sorrow, correct his faults by harsh treatment of himself, use the plainest meat and drink for the sake of his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and not of his belly: usually he shall nourish <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> by <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, whole days and nights together he shall moan, and weep, and wail to the <a href="08329a.htm">Lord</a> his <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, cast himself at the feet of the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, fall on his knees before those who are dear to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and beseech them to plead in his behalf". At a very early period, the <em>exomologesis</em> was divided into four parts or "stations", and the penitents were grouped in as many different classes according to their progress in penance. The lower class, the <em>flentes</em> (weeping) remained outside the church door and besought the <a href="08070a.htm">intercession</a> of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> as these passed into the church. The <em>audientes</em> (hearers) were stationed in the <a href="10704b.htm">narthex</a> of the church behind the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and were permitted to remain during the Mass of the <a href="03430b.htm">Catechumens</a>, i.e., until the end of the <a href="07448a.htm">sermon</a>. The <em>substrati</em> (prostrate), or <em>genuflectentes</em> (<a href="06423a.htm">kneeling</a>), occupied the space between the door and the <a href="01381e.htm">ambo</a>, where they received the imposition of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands or his <a href="02599b.htm">blessing</a>. Finally, the <em>consistentes</em> were so called because they were allowed to hear the whole Mass without communicating, or because they remained at their place while the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> approached the Holy Table. This grouping into stations originated in the East, where at least the three higher groups are mentioned about A.D. 263 by <a href="07015a.htm">Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, and the first or lowest group by <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (<a href="../fathers/3202199.htm">Epistle 199, chapter 22</a> and <a href="../fathers/3202217.htm">Epistle 217, chapter 56</a>). In the West the classification did not exist, or at any rate the different stations were not so clearly marked; the penitents were treated pretty much as the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>exomologesis</em> terminated with the reconciliation, a <a href="14133a.htm">solemn</a> function which took place on <a href="10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> just before Mass. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> presided, assisted by his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>. A consultation (<em>concilium</em>) was held to determine which of the penitents deserved readmission; the Penitential Psalms and the <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a> were recited at the foot of the <a href="01362a.htm">altar</a>; the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in a brief address reminded the penitents of their <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to lead henceforth an upright life; the penitents, lighted <a href="03246a.htm">candles</a> in hand, were then led into the church; <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> and <a href="12787a.htm">responses</a> were said, and, finally, the public <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> was given. (See Schmitz, "Die Bussbucher u. die Bussdisciplin d. Kirche", Mainz, 1883; <a href="06322c.htm">Funk</a> in "Kirchenlex.", s.v. "Bussdisciplin"; Pohle in "Kirchl. Handlex.", s.v. "Bussdisciplin"; Tixeront, "Hist. des dogmes", Paris, 1905; Eng. tr., St. Louis, 1910.) Regarding the <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> of this <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> given by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, various opinions have been put forward. According to one view, it was the remission, not of guilt but of the temporal punishment; the guilt had already been remitted by the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> which the penitent received in confession before he entered on the public penance. This finds support in the fact that the reconciliation could be effected by a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> in case of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> and in the absence of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, as appears from <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (<a href="../fathers/050618.htm">Epistle 18</a>).</p>

<p>Speaking of those who had received <em><a href="09211a.htm">libelli</a></em> from the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> he says: "If they are overtaken by illness, they need not wait for our coming, but may make the <em>exomologesis</em> of their <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> before any <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, or, if no <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> be at hand, and death is imminent, before a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, that thus, by the imposition of his hands unto penance, they may come to the Lord with the peace which the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> had besought us by letters to grant." On the other hand, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> could not give <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>; consequently, his function in such cases was to <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> the penitent from punishment; and, as he was authorized herein to do what the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> did by the public <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>, this could not have been <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a>. There is the further consideration that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> did not necessarily hear the confessions of those whom he <a href="01061a.htm">absolved</a> at the time of reconciliation, and moreover the ancient <a href="06141a.htm">formularies</a> prescribe that at this <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> shall hear the confession, and that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after that, shall pronounce <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>. But <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> can be given only by him who hears the confession. And again, the public penance often lasted many years; consequently, if the penitent were not <a href="01061a.htm">absolved</a> at the beginning, he would have remained during all that <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> in the state of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, incapable of <a href="10202b.htm">meriting</a> anything for <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> by his penitential exercises, and exposed to the danger of sudden death (<a href="11739b.htm">Pesch</a>, op. cit., p. 110 sq. Cf. <a href="11430c.htm">Palmieri</a>, op. cit., p. 459; Pignataro, "De disciplina poenitentiali", Rome, 1904, p. 100; Di Dario, "II sacramento della penitenza nei primi secoli del cristianesimo", Naples, 1908, p. 81).</p>

<p>The writers who hold that the final <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> was <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a>, insist that there is no documentary evidence of a secret confession; that if this had been in <a href="05543b.htm">existence</a>, the harder way of the public penance would have been abandoned; that the argument from prescription loses its force if the <a href="03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of public penance be denied; and that this penance contained all that is required in a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. (Boudinhon, "Sur l'histoire de la p&eacute;nitence" in "Revue d'histoire et de litterature religieuses", II, 1897, p. 306 sq. Cf. <a href="07383a.htm">Hogan</a> in "Am. Cath. Q. Rev.", July, 1900; Batiffol, "Etudes d'histoire et de th&eacute;ologie positive", Paris, 1902, p. 195 sq.; Vacandard in "Dict. de theol.", s.v. "Absolution", 156-61; O'Donnell, "Penance in the Early Church", Dublin 1907, p. 95 sq.) While this discussion concerns the practice under ordinary circumstances, it is commonly admitted that <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> was granted at the time of confession to those who were in danger of death. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, in fact, did not, in her universal practice, refuse <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> at the last moment even in the case of those who had committed grievous <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>, writing in 442 to Theodore, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>, says: "Neither satisfaction is to be forbidden nor reconciliation denied to those who in time of need and imminent danger implore the aid of penance and then of reconciliation." After pointing out that penance should not be deferred from day to day until the moment "when there is hardly space either for the confession of the penitent or his reconciliation by the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>"; he adds that even in these circumstances "the action of penance and the grace of communion should not be denied if asked for by the penitent" (Ep. cviii, c. iv, in P.L., LIV, 1011). <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> states expressly that he was applying the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rule (<em>ecclesiastica regula</em>).</p>

<p>Shortly before, St. Celestine (428) had expressed his horror at learning that "penance was refused the dying and that the desire of those was not granted who in the hour of death sought this remedy for their <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>"; this, he says, is "adding death to death and killing with cruelty the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> that is not <a href="01061a.htm">absolved</a>" (Letter to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="12514a.htm">provinces</a> of <a href="15423a.htm">Vienne</a> and Narbonne, c. ii). That such a refusal was not in accordance with the earlier practice is evident from the words of the <a href="11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> (325): "With respect to the dying, the ancient canonical law shall now also be observed, namely, that if any one depart from this life, he shall by no means be deprived of the last and most <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="15397c.htm">viaticum</a>" (<a href="../fathers/3801.htm">canon 13</a>). If the dying <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> could receive the Eucharist, <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> certainly could not be denied. If at times greater severity seems to be shown, this consisted in the refusal, not of <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> but of communion; such was the penalty prescribed by the <a href="05395b.htm">Council of Elvira</a> (306) for those who after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> had fallen into <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. The same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of the canon (22) of the <a href="01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (314) which enacts that communion shall not be given to "those who <a href="01624b.htm">apostatize</a>, but never appear before the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, nor even seek to do penance, and yet afterwards, when attacked by illness, request communion". The council lays stress on the lack of proper disposition in such sinners, as does also <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> when he forbids that they who "do no penance nor manifest heartfelt sorrow" be admitted to communion and peace if in illness and danger they ask for it; for what prompts them to seek (communion) is, not repentance for their <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the <a href="06021a.htm">fear</a> of approaching death" (<a href="../fathers/050651.htm#n23"><em>Epistle 51</em>, no. 23</a>).</p>

<p>A further evidence of the severity with which public penance, and especially its <a href="14133a.htm">solemn</a> form, was administered is the fact that it could be performed only once. This is evident from some of the texts quoted above (<a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, Hermas). <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> also says: "For the graver crimes, there is only one opportunity of penance" (Hom. xv, "In Levit.", c. ii); and <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>: "As there is one <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> so there is one penance, which, however, is performed publicly" (<a href="../fathers/34062.htm"><em>On Penance</em> II.10.95</a>). St. Augustine gives the reason: "Although, by a wise and salutary provision, opportunity for performing that humblest kind of penance is granted but once in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest the remedy, become common, should be less efficacious for the sick . . . yet who will dare to say to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>: Wherefore dost thou once more spare this man who after a first penance has again bound himself in the fetters of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>?" (Ep. cliii, "Ad Macedonium"). It may well be admitted that the <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the earliest days was rigorous, and that in some Churches or by <a href="07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> it was carried to extremes. This is plainly stated by <a href="08011a.htm">Pope St. Innocent</a> (405) in his letter (Ep. vi, c. ii) to <a href="05731a.htm">Exuperius</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. The question had been raised as to what should be done with those who, after a lifetime of licentious indulgence, begged at the end for penance and communion. "Regarding these", writes the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, "the earlier practice was more severe, the later more tempered with mercy. The former <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> was that penance should be granted, but communion denied; for in those times <a href="11703a.htm">persecutions</a> were frequent, hence, lest the easy admission to communion should fail to bring back from their <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> ways men who were sure of reconciliation, very rightly communion was refused, while penance was granted in order that the refusal might not be total. . . . But after <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> had restored peace to his Churches, and terror had ceased, it was judged well that communion be given the dying lest we should seem to follow the harshness and sternness of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a> in denying pardon. Communion, therefore, shall be given at the last along with penance, that these men, if only in the supreme moment of death, may, with the permission of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a>, be rescued from eternal destruction."</p>

<p>The mitigation of public penance which this passage indicates continued throughout the subsequent period, especially the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The office of <em>poenitentiarius</em> had already (390) been abolished in the East by <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, in consequence of a <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> that grew out of public confession. Soon afterwards, the four "stations" disappeared, and public penance fell into disuse. ln the West it underwent a more gradual transformation. <a href="05678a.htm">Excommunication</a> continued in use, and the <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> was frequently resorted to. The performance of penance was left in large measure to the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and good will of the penitent; increasing clemency was shown by allowing the reconciliation to take place somewhat before the prescribed <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> was completed; and the practice was introduced of commuting the enjoined penance into other exercises or works of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, such as <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>. According to a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Council of Clermont (1095), those who joined a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> were freed from all <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> in the matter of penance. Finally it became customary to let the reconciliation follow immediately after confession. With these modifications the ancient usage had practically disappeared by the middle of the sixteenth century. Some attempts were made to revive it after the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, but these were isolated and of short duration. (See <a href="07783a.htm">INDULGENCES</a>.)</p>

<h2>In the British and Irish Churches</h2>

<p>The penitential system in these countries was established simultaneously with the introduction of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, was rapidly developed by episcopal <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> and synodal enactments, and was reduced to definite form in the <a href="11636a.htm">Penitentials</a>. These books exerted such an influence on the practice in Continental <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> that, according to one opinion, they "first brought order and unity into <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> in these matters" (Wasserschleben, "Bussordnungen d. abendlandischen Kirche", Halle, 1851, p. 4. &#151; For a different view see Schmitz, "Die Bussbucher u. die Bussdisciplin d. Kirche", Mainz, 1888, p. 187). In any case, it is beyond question that in their <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> and practice the Churches of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a> were at one with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The so-called <a href="14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> that a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> who commits any of the capital <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> shall perform a year's penance for each offence and at the end shall "come with <a href="15677a.htm">witnesses</a> and be <a href="01061a.htm">absolved</a> by the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>" (Wilkins, "Concilia", I, p. 3). Another <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> of <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> ordains that "the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> shall decide to whom the power of binding and loosing be committed, but forgiveness is more in keeping with the examples of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a>; let penance be short, with weeping and lamentation, and a mournful garb, rather than long and tempered with relaxations "(Wilkins, ibid., p. 4). For various opinions regarding the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> and origin of the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, see Haddan and Stubbs, "Councils", II, 331; Bury, "Life of St. Patrick", London, 1905. The confessor was called <em>anmchara</em> <em>(animae carus</em>), i.e., "soul's friend". <a href="04136a.htm">St. Columba</a> was <em>anmchara</em> to Aidan, Lord of Dalraida, A.D. 574 (<a href="01135c.htm">Adamnan's</a> "Life of St. Columba", ed. Reeves, p. lxxvi); and <a href="01135c.htm">Adamnan</a> was "soul's friend" to Finnsnechta, Monarch of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, A.D. 675 (ibid., p. xliii). The "Life of St. Columba" relates the coming of Feachnaus to <a href="08090a.htm">Iona</a>, where, with weeping and lamentation, he fell at Columba's feet and "before all who were present confessed his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>. Then the <a href="04171a.htm">Saint</a> weeping with him, said to him: 'Arise, my son and be comforted; thy <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> which thou hast committed are forgiven; because, as it is written, a <a href="04337a.htm">contrite</a> and <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> heart <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> doth not despise,'" (ibid., I, 30). The need and effects of confession are explained in the Leabhar Breac: "Penance frees from all the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Every one desirous of a cure for his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> with the Lord must make an <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> and sorrowful confession; and the confession with the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> are as <a href="02258b.htm">baptisms</a> to him. As sickness injures the body, so <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> injures the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>; and as there is a cure for the disease of the body, so there is balm for that of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. And as the wounds of the body are shown to a physician, so, too, the sores of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> must be exposed. As he who takes poison is saved by a vomit, so, too, the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is healed by confession and declaration of his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> with sorrow, and by the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and a determination henceforth to observe the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. . . . Because <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> left to His <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, to the <a href="08552a.htm">end of the world</a>, the power of loosing and binding."</p>

<p>That confession was required before Communion is evident from the <a href="11618b.htm">penitential</a> ascribed to <a href="04137a.htm">St. Columbanus</a>, which orders (can. xxx) "that confessions be given with all diligence, especially concerning commotions of the <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>, before going to Mass, lest perchance any one approach the <a href="01362a.htm">altar</a> unworthily, that is, if he have not a clean heart. For it is better to wait till the heart be sound and free from <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> and <a href="08326b.htm">envy</a>, than daringly to approach the judgment of the tribunal; for the <a href="01362a.htm">altar</a> is the tribunal of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and His Body, even there with His Blood, judges those who approach unworthily. As, therefore, we must beware of capital <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> before communicating, so, also, from the more uncertain defects and diseases of a languid <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for us to abstain and to be cleansed before going to that which is a conjunction with <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> peace and a joining with <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>". In the "Life of St. Maedoc of Ferns" it is said of the <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> King Brandubh: "And so he departed without confession and the communication of the Eucharist." But the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> restored him to life for a while, and then, "having made his confession and received <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> and the <a href="15397c.htm">viaticum</a> of the <a href="05572c.htm">Body of Christ</a>, King Brandubh went to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and was <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> in the city of <a href="09520a.htm">St. Maedoc</a> which is called <a href="06045a.htm">Ferns</a>, where the kings of that land are <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a>" (Acta SS. Hib., col. 482). The metrical "Rule of St. Carthach", translated by <a href="11205b.htm">Eugene O'Curry</a>, gives this direction to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>: "If you go to give communion at the awful point of death, you must receive confession without shame, without reserve." In the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> for giving communion to the sick (<a href="04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a>) we read: "O <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, who hast willed that <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> should be forgiven by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of the hands</a> of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> . . ." and then follows the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>: "We <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> thee as representatives of <a href="11744a.htm">blessed Peter</a>, Prince of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, to whom the Lord gave the power of binding and loosing." That confession was regularly a part of the <a href="04660c.htm">preparation for death</a> is attested by the Council of Cashel (1172) which commands the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> in case of illness to make their will "in the presence of their confessor and neighbours", and prescribes that to those who die "with a good confession" due tribute shall be paid in the form of Masses and <a href="03071a.htm">burial</a> (can. vi, vii).</p>

<p>The practice of public penance was regulated in great detail by the <a href="11636a.htm">Penitentials</a>. That of St. Cummian prescribes that "if any <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> refuses penance to the dying, he is guilty of the loss of their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> . . . for there can be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> at the last moment, since <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has regard not of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> alone, but of the heart also, and the thief gained <a href="14519a.htm">Paradise</a> in the last hour of his confession" (C. xiv, 2). Other <a href="11636a.htm">Penitentials</a> bear the names of St. Finnian, Sts. <a href="04640b.htm">David</a> and <a href="06557c.htm">Gildas</a>, <a href="04137a.htm">St. Columbanus</a>, <a href="01135c.htm">Adamnan</a>. The collection of canons known as the "Hibernensis" is especially important, as it cites, under the head of "Penance" (bk. XLVII), the teaching of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, and other Fathers, thus showing the continuity of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and observance with that of the early <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. (See <a href="16051a.htm">Lanigan</a>, "Eccl. Hist. of Ireland", Dublin, 1829; Moran, "Essays on the Early Irish Church", Dublin, 1864; Malone, "Church Hist. of Ireland", Dublin, 1880; Warren, "The Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church", Oxford, 1881; Salmon, "The Ancient Irish Church", Dublin, 1897.)</p>

<h2>In the Anglo-Saxon Church</h2>

<p>In the <a href="01505a.htm">Anglo-Saxon Church</a> penance was called <em>behreowsung</em>, from the verb <em>hreowan</em>, whence our word "to rue". The confessor was the <em>scrift</em>; confession, <em>scrift spraec</em>; and the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> itself was the <em>scriftscir</em>, i.e., "confession district" &#151; a term which shows plainly the close relation between confession and the work of religion in general. The practice in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> can be traced back to the times immediately following the country's conversion. <a href="02384a.htm">Ven. Bede</a> (H.E., IV, 23 [25]) gives the story of <a href="01135c.htm">Adamnan</a>, an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of the seventh century, who belonged to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Coldingham, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. In his youth, having committed some <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, he went to a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, confessed, and was given a penance to be performed until the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> should return. But the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> went to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and died there, and <a href="01135c.htm">Adamnan</a> continued his penance to the end of his days. When <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> (635-87) on his missionary tours preached to the people, "they all confessed openly what they had done, . . . and what they confessed they expiated; as he commanded them, by worthy fruits of penance" (Bede, op. cit., IV, 25). <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> (735-804) declares that "without confession there is no pardon" (P.L., C, 337); that "he who accuses himself of his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> will not have the <a href="04764a.htm">devil</a> for an accuser in the <a href="08552a.htm">day of judgment</a>" (P.L., CI, 621); that "he who conceals his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and is ashamed to make wholesome confession, has <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> as <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> now and will have him again as avenger" (ibid., 622). <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> (1005-89) has a treatise, "De celunda confessione", i.e., on keeping confession secret, in which he rebukes those who give the slightest intimation of what they have heard in confession (P.L., CL, 626).</p>

<p>The penitentials were known as <em>scrift bocs</em>. The one attributed to <a href="14571a.htm">Archbishop Theodore</a> (602-90) says: "The <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> is not allowed to impose penance on a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>; this should be done by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or priests" (bk. II, 2): and further; "According to the canons, penitents should not receive communion until their penance is completed; but we, for mercy's sake, allow them to receive at the end of a year or six months" (I, 12). An important statement is that "public reconciliation is not established in this province, for the reason that there is no public penance"&mdash;which shows that the minute prescriptions contained in the <a href="11618b.htm">penitential</a> were meant for the guidance of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in giving penance privately, i.e., in confession. Among the <em>excerptiones</em>, or extracts, from the canons which bear the name of <a href="05326a.htm">Archbishop Egbert of York</a> (d. 766), canon xlvi says that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall hear no cause without the presence of his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, except in case of confession (Wilkins, "Concilia", I, 104). His Penitential prescribes (IX) that "a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> shall not refuse confession to those who desire it, though they be guilty of many <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>" (ibid., 126). The Council of Chalcuth (A.D. 787): "If any one depart this life without penance or confession, he shall not be <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> for" (can. xx). The canons published under King Edgar (960) have a special section "On Confession" which begins: "When one wishes to confess his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, let him <a href="01115a.htm">act</a> manfully, and not be ashamed to confess his <a href="14004b.htm">misdeeds</a> and crimes, accusing himself; because hence comes pardon, and because without confession there is no pardon; confession heals; confession justifies" (ibid., 229). The Council of Eanham (1009): "Let every <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> do as behooves him, strictly keep his <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, accustom himself to frequent confession, fearlessly confess his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, and carefully make amends according as he is directed" (can. xvii, Wilkins, ibid., 289). Among the ecclesiastical laws enacted (1033) by <a href="03306c.htm">King Canute</a>, we find this exhortation: "Let us with all diligence turn back from our <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, and let us each confess our <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> to our confessor, and ever [after] refrain from evil-doing and mend our ways" (XVIII, Wilkins, ibid., 303).</p>

<p>The Council of <a href="05211a.htm">Durham</a> (c. 1220): "How <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> is the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of penance, those words of the Gospel <a href="12454c.htm">prove</a>: Whose <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, etc. . . . But since we obtain the pardon of our <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> confession, we prescribe in accordance with the <a href="11636a.htm">canonical statutes</a> that the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in giving penance shall carefully consider the amount of the penance, the <a href="12589c.htm">quality</a> of the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, the place, <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a>, duration and other circumstances of the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>; and especially the devotion of the penitent and the signs of <a href="04337a.htm">contrition</a>." Similar directions are given by the Council of Oxford (1222), which adds after various admonitions: "Let no <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> dare, either out of <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a> or even through <a href="06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, to reveal the confession of anyone by word or sign . . . and should he be convicted of doing this he ought deservedly to be <a href="04677c.htm">degraded</a> without hope of relaxation" (Wilkins, ibid., 595). The Scottish Council (c. 1227) repeats these injunctions and prescribes "that once a year the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> shall confess all their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> either to their own [<a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>] <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or, with his permission, to some other <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>" (can. lvii). Explicit instructions for the confessor are found in the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of Alexander, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Coventry (1237), especially in regard to the manner of questioning the penitent and enjoining penance. The Council of Lambeth (1261) declares: "Since the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of confession and penance, the second plank after shipwreck, the last part of <a href="09580c.htm">man's</a> seafaring, the final refuge, is for every sinner most <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> unto <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, we strictly forbid, under pain of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, that anyone should presume to hinder the free administration of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> to each who asks for it" (Wilkins, ibid., 754).</p>

<p>To give some <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the ancient <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a>, the penalties attached to graver crimes are cited here from the English and <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="11636a.htm">Penitentials</a>. For stealing, Cummian prescribes that a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> shall do one year of penance; a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a>, two; a <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> three; a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, four; a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, five; a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, six. For <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> or <a href="11696a.htm">perjury</a>, the penance lasted three, five, six, seven, ten or twelve years according to the criminal's rank. <a href="14571a.htm">Theodore</a> commands that if any one leave the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, join the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and induce others to do the same, he shall, in case he repent, do penance for twelve years. For the <a href="11696a.htm">perjurer</a> who swears by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Gospel, or the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, Egbert prescribes seven or eleven years of penance. <a href="15235c.htm">Usury</a> entailed three years; <a href="08001b.htm">infanticide</a>, fifteen; <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a> or <a href="04767a.htm">demon-worship</a>, ten. Violations of the sixth <a href="04153a.htm">commandment</a> were punished with great severity; the penance varied, according to the nature of the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, from three to fifteen years, the extreme penalty being prescribed for <a href="07717a.htm">incest</a>, i.e., fifteen to twenty-five years. Whatever its duration, the penance included <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> on bread and water, either for the whole period or for a specified portion. Those who could not <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> instead to recite daily a certain number of <a href="12533a.htm">psalms</a>, to give <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>, take the discipline (scourging) or perform some other penitential exercise as determined by the confessor. (See <a href="09270c.htm">Lingard</a>, "Hist. and Antiq. of the Anglo-Saxon Church", London, 1845; Thurston, "Confession in England before the Conquest" in "The Tablet", February and March, 1905.)</p>

<h2>Confession in the Anglican Church</h2>

<p>In the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>, according to the rule laid down in the <a href="02678c.htm">"Prayer Book"</a>, there is a general confession prescribed for morning and evening Service, also for <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>; this confession is followed by a general <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> like the one in use in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Also in the <a href="02678c.htm">"Prayer Book"</a> confession is counselled for the quieting of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> and for the good that comes from <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> and the peace that arises from the fatherly direction of the <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. There is also mention of private confession in the office for the sick: "Here shall the sick <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> be moved to make a special confession of his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> if he feel his <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> troubled with any weighty matter. After which the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> shall <a href="01061a.htm">absolve</a> him (if he humbly and heartily desire it) after this sort: '<a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who has left the power to his <a href="03744a.htm">Church'</a> etc." Since the beginning of the <a href="11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a> confession after the manner practised in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has become more frequent among those of the High Church party. In 1873 a petition was sent to the <a href="04348a.htm">Convocation</a> of the <a href="03299b.htm">Archdiocese of Canterbury</a> asking provision for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and authorization of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the work of the confessional. In the joint letter of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and York disapprobation of such course was markedly expressed and the determination not to encourage the practice of private confession openly avowed. The <a href="12582a.htm">Puseyites</a> replied citing the authority of the <a href="02678c.htm">"Prayer Book"</a> as given above. In our time among the High Church folk one notices confessionals in the churches and one hears of discourses made to the people enjoining confession as a <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> to pardon. Those who hear confessions make use generally of the rules and directions laid down in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "Manuals", and especially popular is the "Manual" of the <a href="06398b.htm">Abb&eacute; Gaume</a> (A.G. Mortimer "Confession and Absolution", London, 1906).</p>

<h2>Utility of Confession</h2>

<p>Mr. Lea ("A History of Auricular Confession", Vol. II, p. 456) says: "No one can deny that there is <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman's</a> argument: 'How many <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> are there in distress, anxiety and loneliness, whose one need is to find a being to whom they can pour out their feelings unheard by the world. They want to tell them and not to tell them, they wish to tell them to one who is strong enough to hear them, and yet not too strong so as to despise them'"; and then Mr. Lea adds: "It is this weakness of <a href="09580c.htm">humanity</a> on which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has speculated, the weakness of those unable to bear their burdens . . . who find comfort in the system built up through the experience of the ages", etc. It has been made clear that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has simply carried out the mind of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>: "Whatever you shall loose shall be loosed"; still we do not hesitate to accept Mr. Lea's reason, that this institution answers in large measure to the needs of <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>, who <a href="10559a.htm">morally</a> are indeed weak and in darkness. True, Mr. Lea denies the probability of finding <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> capable of exercising aright this great ministry, and he prefers to enumerate the rare abuses which the weakness of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> has <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a>, rather than to listen to the millions who have found in the tribunal of penance a remedy for their anxieties of <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>, and a peace and security of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> the value of which is untold. The very abuses of which he speaks at such length have been the occasion of greater care, greater diligence, on the part of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The few inconveniences arising from the perversity of <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>, which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has met with admirable legislation, should not blind <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> to the great good that confession has brought, not only to the <a href="07762a.htm">individual</a>, but even to <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>.</p>

<p>Thinking men even outside the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> have acknowledged the usefulness to <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of the tribunal of penance. Amongst these the words of <a href="09134b.htm">Leibniz</a> are not unknown ("Systema theologicum", Paris, 1819, p. 270): "This whole work of <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> penance is indeed worthy of the Divine wisdom and if aught else in the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian dispensation</a> is meritorious of praise, surely this wondrous institution. For the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of confessing one's <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> deters a man from committing them, and <a href="07465b.htm">hope</a> is given to him who may have fallen again after expiation. The <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="12517b.htm">prudent</a> confessor is in very deed a great instrument in the hands of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for <a href="09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="12714a.htm">regeneration</a>. For the kindly advice of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> helps <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> to control his <a href="11534a.htm">passions</a>, to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the lurking places of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, to avoid the <a href="11196a.htm">occasions of evil doing</a>, to restore ill-gotten goods, to have <a href="07465b.htm">hope</a> after depression and <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>, to have peace after affliction, in a word, to remove or at least lessen all <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, and if there is no pleasure on earth like unto a faithful friend, what must be the esteem a man must have for him, who is in very deed a friend in the hour of his direst need?"</p>

<p>Nor is <a href="09134b.htm">Leibniz</a> alone in expressing this feeling of the great benefits that may come from the use of confession. <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> realize, not only the value of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> position, but also the need of the confessional for the spiritual <a href="12714a.htm">regeneration</a> of their subjects. Dr. Martensen, in his "Christian Dogmatics" (Edinburgh, 1890), p. 443, thus outlines his views: "Absolution in the name of the Father and of the <a href="14142b.htm">Son</a> and of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, derived from the full power of binding and loosing which the church has inherited from the <a href="01626c.htm">apostles</a>, is not unconditional, but depends on the same <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a> on which the <a href="06655b.htm">gospel</a> itself adjudges the forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, namely, change of heart and <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. If reform is to take place here, it must be effected either by endeavouring to revive private confession, or, as has been proposed, by doing away with the union between confession and the Lord's Supper, omitting, that is, the <a href="14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>, because what it presupposes (personal confession of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>) has fallen into disuse, and retaining only the words of preparation, with the exhortation to self-examination, a testifying of the comfortable promises of the <a href="06655b.htm">gospel</a>, and a wish for a <a href="02599b.htm">blessing</a> upon the communicants." Under the head of "Observations" he states: "It cannot easily be denied that confession meets a deep need of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>. There is a great <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> in the saying of <a href="11511a.htm">Pascal</a>, that a man often attains for the first time a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> sense of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> stayedness in his good purpose, when he confesses his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> to his fellow <a href="09580c.htm">man</a>, as well as to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> has often been commended because by confession it affords an opportunity of depositing the confession of his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> in the breast of another <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> where it remains kept under the <a href="13649b.htm">seal of the most sacred secrecy</a>, and whence the consolation of the forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> is given him in the very name of the Lord."</p>

<p>True, he believes that this great need is met more fully with the kind of confession practised in <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, but he does not hesitate to add: "It is a matter of regret that private confession, as an institution, meeting as it does this want in a regular manner, has fallen into disuse; and that the objective point of union is wanting for the many, who desire to unburden their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> by confessing not to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> only but to a fellowman, and who feel their need of comfort and of forgiveness, which anyone indeed may draw for himself from the <a href="06655b.htm">gospel</a>, but which in many instances he may desire to hear spoken by a man, who speaks in virtue of the authority of his holy office."</p>
