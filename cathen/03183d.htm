<p>(Written by most Latins, <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Optatus, etc. CALLIXTUS or CALIXTUS).</p>

<p><a href="09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, died c. 223. His contemporary, <a href="08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a>, gives the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of his accession as the first (or second?) year of <a href="07206b.htm">Elagabalus</a>, i.e., 218 or 219. <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and the Liberian catalogue agree in giving him five years of episcopate. His Acts are spurious, but he is the earliest <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> found the fourth-century "Depositio Martirum", and this is good evidence that he was really a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>, although he lived in a time of peace under <a href="13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a>, whose mother was a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. We learn from the "Historiae Augustae" that a spot on which he had built an oratory was claimed by the tavern-keepers, <em>popinarii</em>, but the emperor decided that the worship of any god was better than a tavern. This is said to have been the origin of Sta. Maria in Trastevere, which was built, according to the Liberian catalogue, by Pope Julius, <em>juxta Callistum</em>. In fact the Church of St. Callistus is close by, containing a well into which legend says his body was thrown, and this is probably the church he built, rather than the more famous basilica. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in the cemetery of Calepodius on the Aurelian Way, and his anniversary is given by the "Depositio Martirum" (<em>Callisti in vi&acirc; Aureli&acirc; miliario III</em>) and by the subsequent <a href="09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> on 14 October, on which day his <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is still kept. His <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> were translated in the ninth century to Sta. Maria in Trastevere.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Our chief <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> is from his bitter enemies, <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> who wrote the "Philosophumena", no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>. Their <a href="03190c.htm">calumnies</a> are probably based on facts. According to the "Philosophumena" (c. ix) Callistus was the slave of Carpophorus, a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> of the household of Caesar. His master entrusted large sums of money to Callistus, with which he started a bank in which brethren and <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a> lodged money, all of which Callistus lost. He took to flight. Carpophorus followed him to Portus, where Callistus had embarked on a ship. Seeing his master approach in a boat, the slave jumped into the sea, but was prevented from drowning himself, dragged ashore, and consigned to the punishment reserved for slaves, the <em>pistrinum</em>, or hand-mill. The brethren, <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> that he still had money in his name, begged that he might be released. But he had nothing, so he again courted death by insulting the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> at their <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a>. The <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> haled him before the prefect Fuscianus. Carpophorus declared that Callistus was not to be looked upon as a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but he was thought to be trying to save his slave, and Callistus was sent to the mines in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. Some time after this, Marcia, the mistress of <a href="04166a.htm">Commodus</a>, sent for <a href="15409a.htm">Pope Victor</a> and asked if there were any <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. He gave her the list, without including Callistus. Marcia sent a eunuch who was a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> (or "old man") to release the <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. Callistus fell at his feet, and persuaded him to take him also. Victor was annoyed; but being a compassionate man, he kept silence. However, he sent Callistus to Antium with a monthly allowance. When <a href="15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a> became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, Callistus was recalled and set over the cemetery belonging to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, not a private <a href="03417b.htm">catacomb</a>; it has ever since borne Callistus's name. He obtained great influence over the <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, illiterate, and grasping <a href="15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a> by bribes. We are not told how it came about that the runaway slave (now free by <a href="09079a.htm">Roman law</a> from his master, who had lost his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> when Callistus was condemned to penal servitude to the State) became <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and then <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>.</p>

<p><a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> and <a href="04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> have demolished this contemporary <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a>. To begin with, <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> does not say that Callistus by his own fault lost the money deposited with him. He evidently jumped from the vessel rather to escape than to commit <a href="14326b.htm">suicide</a>. That Carpophorus, a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, should commit a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> slave to the horrible punishment of the <em>pistrinum</em> does not speak well for the master's character. The intercession of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> for Callistus is in his favour. It is absurd to suppose that he courted death by attacking a <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a>; it is clear that he asked the Jewish money-lenders to repay what they owed him, and at some risk to himself. The declaration of Carpophorus that Callistus was no <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> was <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> and <a href="05781a.htm">untrue</a>. <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> himself shows that it was as a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> that Callistus was sent to the mines, and therefore as a confessor, and that it was as a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> that he was released. If Pope Victor granted Callistus a monthly pension, he need not suppose that he regretted his release. It is unlikely that <a href="15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a> was <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and base. Callistus could hardly have raised himself so high without considerable talents, and the vindictive spirit exhibited by <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> and his defective <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> explain why <a href="15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a> placed his confidence rather in Callistus than in the learned disciple of <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of Callistus is challenged by both <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> and <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> on the ground that in a famous edict he granted Communion after due penance to those who had committed <a href="01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication. It is clear that Callistus based his <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> on the power of binding and loosing granted to Peter, to his successors, and to all in communion with them: "As to thy decision", cries the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanist</a> <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "I ask, whence dost thou usurp this right of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>? If it is because the Lord said to Peter: Upon this rock I will build My Church, I will give thee the keys of the <a href="08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>', or whatsoever though bindest or loosest on earth shall be bound or loosed in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>', that thou presumest that this power of binding and loosing has been handed down to thee also, that is to every Church in communion with Peter's (<em>ad omnem ecclesiam Petri propinquam</em>, i.e. <em>Petri ecclesiae propinquam</em>), who art thou that destroyest and alterest the manifest intention of the Lord, who conferred this on Peter personally and alone?" (<a href="../fathers/0407.htm"><em>On Pudicity</em> 21</a>) The edict was an order to the whole Church (ib., i): "I hear that an edict has been published, and a peremptory one; the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which means the Pontifex Maximus, proclaims: I remit the crimes of <a href="01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication to those who have done penance." Doubtless <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> and <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> were upholding a supposed custom of earlier times, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in decreeing a relaxation was regarded as enacting a new law. On this point it is unnecessary to justify Callistus. Other complaints of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> are that Callistus did not put converts from <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> to public penance for <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> committed outside the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (this mildness was customary in <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> time; that he had received into his "school" (i.e. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>) those whom <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> had <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> from "The Church" (i.e., his own <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>); that he declared that a mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> was not ("always", we may supply) a sufficient reason for deposing a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De Exhort. Castitatis, vii) speaks with reprobation of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been married more than once, and <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> charges Callistus with being the first to allow this, against <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> rule. But in the East marriages before <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> were not counted, and in any case the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> is one from which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> can dispense if necessity arise. Again Callistus allowed the lower <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to <a href="09707a.htm">marry</a>, and permitted noble ladies to marry low <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> and slaves, which by the <a href="09079a.htm">Roman law</a> was forbidden; he had thus given occasion for <a href="08001b.htm">infanticide</a>. Here again Callistus was rightly insisting on the distinction between the ecclesiastical law of marriage and the <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>, which later ages have always taught. <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> also declared that rebaptizing (of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>) was performed first in Callistus's day, but he does not state that Callistus was answerable for this. On the whole, then, it is clear that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church sides with Callistus against the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> and the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. Not a word is said against the character of Callistus since his promotion, nor against the validity of his election.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, however, regards Callistus as a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Now <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus's</a> own <a href="14597a.htm">Christology</a> is most imperfect, and he tells us that Callistus accused him of Ditheism. It is not to be wondered at, then, if he calls Callistus the inventor of a kind of modified <a href="10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>. In reality it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a> and Callistus condemned various <a href="10448a.htm">Monarchians</a> and Sabellius himself, as well as the opposite <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>. This is enough to suggest that Callistus held the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. And in fact it cannot be denied that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> must have held a Trinitarian <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> not far from that taught by Callistus's elder contemporary <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and by his much younger contemporary <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a>--a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which was not so explicitly taught in the greater part of the East for a long period afterwards. The accusations of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> speak for the sure tradition of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and for its perfect <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and moderation. If we <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> more of St. Callistus from <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sources, he would probably appear as one of the greatest of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>.</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The Acts of St. Callistus were uncritically defended in the <em>Acta SS.</em>, 14 Oct.; and by MORETTI, <em>De S. Callisto P. et M.</em> (Rome, 1752). The <em>Philosophumena</em> were first published in 1851. On the story of Callistus BUNSEN, <em>Hippolytus and his Age</em> (London, 1852), and CH. WORDSWORTH, <em>St. Hippolytus and the Church of Rome</em> (London, 1853) are worthless. DOLLINGER'S great work <em>Hippolytus und Kallistus</em> (Ratisbon, 1853), tr. PLUMMER (Edinburgh, 1876) is still the chief authority. See also DE ROSSI, <em>Bulletino di Arch. Crist.</em>, IV (1886); NORTHCOTE AND BROWNLOW, <em>Roma Sotterranea</em> (London, 1879), I, 497-505. De Rossi observes that the <em>Liber Pontificalis</em> calls Callistus the son of Domitius, and he found <em>Callistus Domitiorum</em> stamped on some titles of the beginning of the second century. Further there is extant an inscription of a Carpophorus, a freedman of M. Aurelius. The edict of Callistus on penance has been restored with too much assurance by ROLFFS, <em>Das Indulgenz-Edikt des r&ouml;mischen Bischofs Kallist</em> (Leipzig, 1893), Harnack thinks that Callistus also issued a decree about fasting, and that other writings of his may have been known to Pseudo-Isidore, who attributed two letters to him (which will be found in the Councils, in HINSCHIUS, etc.); one of these seems to connect itself with the decision attributed to Callistus by Hippolytus; see HARNACK, <em>Chronol.</em>, II, 207-8. On the Catacomb of St. Callistus see DE ROSSI, <em>Roma Sotterranea</em> (Rome, 1864-77); NORTHCOTE AND BROWNLOW, <em>Roma Sotterranea</em> (London, 1879).</p></div>
