<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Springfield (Campifontis) in <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, erected in June, 1870. It comprises five counties of Central and Western <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>: <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Hampden, Hampshire, Franklin, and Berkshire. Its area is 4320 square miles, a little over half that of the entire state. According to the census of 1910 the population of the territory within the limits of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was 843,212. Of this number 323,122 are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>Some of the early <a href="12581a.htm">Puritans</a> of Central and Western <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> became <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in a remarkable manner: children taken captive by French and Indians at Deerfield and Westboro were carried to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> and there <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. They married in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and the descendants of some of them attained eminence. Joseph-Octave Plessis, who in 1806 became <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Quebec and in a trying time ruled the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Church with firmness and <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a>, was a grandson of Martha French, who a little over a century before had been carried away from the home of her father, Deacon French of Deerfield. Some Acadians were quartered at Worcester in 1655, but the last of them returned to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1767. At the time of the Revolutionary War many <a href="08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> lived in Central and Western <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. Some of them must have been <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but there is no evidence that they contributed in any way to the upbuilding of the future Church of Springfield. The foundations of this Church were laid by <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants, who in 1826 and later came to Worcester, to Chicopee (then a part of Springfield), and to Pittsfield, to dig canals, to lay railroads, and to build and operate factories. The <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of these immigrants was nourished by apostolic men, of whom the foremost was <a href="06084b.htm">Rev. James Fitton</a>. He was born in <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a> in 1805 and <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Fenwick (1827). After a short stay among the Indians at Eastport, <a href="09541b.htm">Maine</a>, he was made <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> at <a href="07144a.htm">Hartford</a>. His missionary <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> carried him into all parts of New England. In <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> his labours extended from "Boston on the east, to Great Barrington in the Berkshires on the west". In 1830 he said <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> in Chicopee. On 7 July, 1834, he laid at Worcester the foundation of the first church which was built in the territory now ruled by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Springfield. He became <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Worcester in 1836. Contemporary with the erection of the church at Worcester, <a href="06084b.htm">Father Fitton</a> purchased land south of the town, on which he built a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. This <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> he deeded (1843) to the Rt. Rev. Benedict J. Fenwick, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>. Bishop Fenwick erected upon it the College of the Holy Cross, which he induced the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> to assume charge of. This was the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college in New England. It began with seventeen students. It has become the largest of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, whose students all follow a classical course, including Greek. Its influence is now felt in all parts of the American possessions. The <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> at Worcester was composed mainly of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>, though it included also French, English, and Americans. From Worcester <a href="06084b.htm">Father Fitton</a> made missionary trips to the towns along the Blackstone, and to the settlements along the Western Railroad. This work was continued and developed by the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> who succeeded him at Worcester. Of those the most energetic, as a missionary, was Rev. Matthew W. Gibson, who in thirteen years built churches in nine places of Worcester County and in ten more established <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The first resident <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Western <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> was Rev. John D. Brady. In 1841 he assumed charge of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Chicopee, which extended over four counties. For four years he shepherded this vast <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> alone. In 1845 Rev. Bernard O'Cavanaugh came to him as an assistant. Rev. Jeremiah O'Callaghan, the <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> and able, if somewhat eccentric, missionary of Vermont, had said <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> at Pittsfield in 1845 and yearly thereafter till 1839. This remarkable man in his old age founded the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> in Holyoke. In 1844 Father Brady built the first church at Pittsfield, of which Rev. Bernard O'Cavanaugh became <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> in 1848. His successor, Rev. Patrick Cudahy, the "church builder of the Berkshires", and <a href="02597a.htm">Rev. William Blenkinsop</a>, who continued the work of Father Brady in the Connecticut Valley, organized into new <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and prepared for further development the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> which was now firmly established in Western <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. To this development <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> contributed when he made of Central and Western <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> with its see at Springfield.</p>

<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>Rt. Rev. Patrick T. O'Reilly, the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Springfield, was born in Cavan, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 24 Dec., 1833. He came to <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a> in his boyhood. He studied classics at St. Charles's College, <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> at St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>, 15 August, 1857, by <a href="02191a.htm">Bishop Bacon of Portland</a>. He served as assistant to <a href="02725b.htm">Father Boyce</a> at St. John's Church, <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, till 1862, when he was sent to organize the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Joseph's, <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>. In 1864 he returned to <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a> as <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. John's. There he remained until he was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Springfield (28 June, 1870), being <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 September of the same year. He ruled the Diocese of Springfield for twenty-one years and a half. During this time its population increased from 90,000 to 200,000; its <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from 43 to 196; its religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> from 12 to 321; its <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> from 43 to 96; its <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> from 2 to 30. Bishop O'Reilly confirmed 77,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. He dedicated 45 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, and laid the corner- stones of nearly a hundred buildings <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> either to religion or to <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. He gave encouragement to <a href="03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. The <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> of the Sisters of Providence of Holyoke and the <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> at Holyoke and at <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a> were begun during his administration. He died 28 May, 1892. He was succeeded by the present (1911) <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Rt. Rev. Thomas D. Beaven, D.D., who was born at Springfield, March, 1851. He studied at Holy Cross College and at the Great Seminary, <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, 18 Dec., 1875. He laboured at Spencer for three years as assistant and for ten as <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In 1888 he was made <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Rosary, Holyoke. Four years later (31 July) he was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Springfield. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 18 Oct., 1892. Bishop Beaven is an organizer. He has applied to the temporal affairs of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> sound business principles. He has developed the <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Brightside, with its infants' home, its <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, its Beaven-Kelly Home for aged men, owes its existence to his inspiration and largely to his generosity. During his administration <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> have been opened in <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Springfield, Montague City, and Adams, <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> at Holyoke, <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, and Leicester, a House of the Good Shepherd at Springfield, and homes for working girls in many places. Springfield has for years been remarkable among the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the country for the number of its vocations to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Four of its <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> have become <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> during the present administration: Rt. Rev. Thomas J. Conaty, D.D. (Monterey and Los Angeles); Rt. Rev. Philip J. Garrigan, D.D. (<a href="14016a.htm">Sioux City</a>); Rt. Rev. Daniel F. Feehan, D.D. (Fall River); and Rt. Rev. Joseph J. Rice, D.D. (Burlington).</p>

<h2>Causes of growth</h2>

<p>The growth of the Diocese of Springfield is due largely to immigration. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> were quickly followed by <a href="03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, and these by Poles and Lithuanians. The <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a> and the Syrians came later. These immigrants came to <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> to get a market for their labour. They prospered and their descendants are among the most esteemed citizens of the commonwealth.</p>

<h2>Religious communities</h2>

<p>About 380 religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> are engaged in charitable work in the diocese. Most of these are Sisters of Providence. The <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> (the first <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> community to enter the diocese) conduct <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> at <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a> and Leicester, the <a href="07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> an <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, the Little <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Mary an old people's home at <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a>; and the Sisters of the Good Shepherd have a house at Springfield. The <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> work of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> requires the services of 750 sisters. The <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> have a normal college in Springfield, an academy at Chicopee, and high schools in many <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. They also do a great part of the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> work.
