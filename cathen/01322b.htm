<p><a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>; b. <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, 1522; d. <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 16 Oct., 1594. He was the third son of John Allen of Rossall, Lancashire, and at the age of fifteen went to Oriel College, <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he graduated <a href="01756c.htm">B. A.</a> in 1550, and was elected Fellow of his College. In 1554 he proceeded M. A., and two years later was chosen Principal of St. Mary's Hall. For a short time he also held a <a href="03252a.htm">canonry</a> at <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, for he had already determined to embrace the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. On the accession of Elizabeth, and the re-establishment of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, Allen was one of those who remained most stanch on the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, and it is chiefly due to his labours that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was not entirely stamped out in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Having resigned all his preferments, he left the country in 1561, and sought a refuge in the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> town of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. The following year, however, we find him back in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, devoting himself, though not yet in <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> orders, to evangelizing his native county. His success was such that it attracted notice and he had to flee for safety. For a while he made himself a missionary centre near <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he had many acquaintances, and later for a time he sought protection with the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the Duke of Norfolk. In 1565 he was again forced to leave <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, this time, as it turned out, for good. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> shortly afterwards. The three years Allen spent as a missioner in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> had a determining effect on his whole after life. For he found everywhere that the people were not <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> by choice, but by force of circumstances; and the majority were only too ready, in response to his preaching and ministrations, to return to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. He was always convinced that the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> wave over the country, due to the action of Elizabeth, could only be temporary, and that the whole future depended on there being a supply of trained <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and controversialists ready to come into the country whenever <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> should be restored. It was to supply this need that he founded the College at Douay since identified with his name. The <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> first developed itself in his mind during a <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in company with Dr. Vendeville, Regius Professor of Canon Law in the <a href="05138a.htm">University of Douay</a>, in 1567. No <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> this was one reason why he thought of Douay as a suitable place for his new college; but it was by no means the only one. Douay was a new <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, founded by <a href="11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a>, under the patronage of King Philip of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (in whose dominions it then was), for the special object of combating the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; and, what is still more to the purpose, it was already under Oxford influences. The first chancellor, Richard Smith, was an Oxford man, as were several of the most influential members of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> at the time when Allen began. It was his <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> to perpetuate Oxford influences and traditions, and to make his new college practically a continuation of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Oxford. A beginning was made in a hired house on Michaelmas Day, 1568. The means of support included, besides Allen's private income, and other <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> donations, a yearly pension of 200 ducats from the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and later on one of 100 gold crowns a month from the <a href="12260a.htm">Pope</a>. The number of students grew rapidly. Often more were received than the income warranted, a course rendered <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the urgent state of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs, which Allen met in the spirit of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>; and in the long run, means were never wanting. The names of <a href="14249b.htm">Thomas Stapleton</a>, Richard Bristowe, <a href="09727a.htm">Gregory Martin</a>, Morgan Philips, and others are still well known to <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and are themselves a sufficient record of the ability of Allen's early companions, and of the work done at the college. Allen had the power of instilling his spirit into his followers. They lived together without written rule, but in perfect mutual harmony, working for the common cause. From the Douay press came forth a constant stream of controversial and other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature, which could not be printed in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> on account of the <a href="11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a>. In this Allen himself took a prominent part. His writings are distinguished by extent of learning and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> acumen. One of the chief works undertaken in the early years of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was the preparation of the well-known <a href="05140a.htm">Douay Bible</a>. The <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was published in 1582, when the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was at <a href="12725a.htm">Rheims</a>; but the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, though completed at the same time, was delayed by want of funds. It eventually appeared at Douay, in 1609, two years before the <a href="02141a.htm">Anglican "Authorized Version"</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But the work for which Allen's college is now most famous was not part of his original scheme, but an outgrowth from it. This was the sending over of missionaries to work for the conversion of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in defiance of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, while the country still remained in the hands of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. There were practically no <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> left, and the Marian <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were rapidly dying out. Granted that the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> rule was to continue indefinitely, the only method to save the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from extinction was to send <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from abroad, and Allen was given "faculties" for all <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to impart to them. They had to face a hard and precarious life, often <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the rack, or even death. When found out they could be convicted of high treason, for which the punishment was to be hanged, drawn and quartered. More than one hundred and sixty Douay <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are known to have been <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a>, the great majority belonging to the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. Many more suffered in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> as Confessors for the Faith. Yet such was the spirit which Allen infused into his students that they rejoiced at the news of each successive <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and by a special privilege sang a solemn Mass of thanksgiving. And the success of the "Seminary Priests", as they were called, was such that at the end of Elizabeth's long reign it is said that the kingdom was still at heart more than half <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. In 1575 Allen made a second journey to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he helped <a href="07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> to found another college to send missionaries to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. For this purpose possession was obtained of the ancient English hospice in the city, which was converted into a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Returning to Douay, Allen found a storm gathering against the English and in 1578 they were expelled from the town. The collegians took refuge at the University of <a href="12725a.htm">Rheims</a>, where they were well received, and continued their work as before, Allen being soon afterwards elected canon of the Cathedral Chapter. In 1579 he paid his third visit to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, being summoned thither in order that he might use his unique personal influence to adjust the dispute between the English and <a href="15532a.htm">Welsh</a> students at the new college there. It was during this visit that he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Commission for the revision of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. Up to this point the career of Allen had won the universal admiration and gratitude of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, for what he himself termed his "scholastical attempts" to convert <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Such was not, however, the case with his political labours to secure the same end, which may be said to have begun about this time, and were far less successful. The famous <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Regnans in excelsis" was issued by <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> in 1570, deposing Queen Elizabeth, and releasing her subjects from their allegiance, but it did not take practical shape till seventeen years later, when preparations were made for the invasion of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> by the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Allen was then once more in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither he had been summoned by the Pope after a dangerous illness two years before. He never left the <a href="13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> again, but he kept in constant communication with his countrymen in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. It had been due to his influence that the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, to which he was greatly attached, undertook to join in the work of the English mission; and now Allen and Father Parsons became joint leaders of the "Spanish Party" among the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The exhortation to take up arms in connection with the Spanish invasion, printed in <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, was issued in Allen's name, though believed to have been composed under the direction of Father Parsons. At the request of King Philip, Allen was created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1587, and held himself in readiness to go to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> immediately, should the invasion prove successful. In estimating the number of those who would be adherents to the scheme, however, Allen and Parsons were both at fault. The large majority of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, generously forgetting the past, sided with their own nation against the Spanish, and the defeat of the <a href="01727c.htm">Armada</a> (1588) was a subject of rejoicing to them no less than to their <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> fellow countrymen. Allen survived the defeat of the <a href="01727c.htm">Armada</a> six years. To the end of his life he remained fully convinced that the time was not far distant when <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> would be <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> again. During his last years there was an estrangement between him and the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, though his personal relations with Father Parsons remained unimpaired. In 1589 he co-operated with him in establishing a new English college at <a href="15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The same year he was nominated by Philip II <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>; but, for some reason which has never been satisfactorily explained, the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a>, although publicly allowed to stand several years, was never confirmed. He continued to reside at the <a href="05472b.htm">English College, Rome</a>, until his death, 16 October, 1594. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> adjoining the college. The following is a list of his printed works: "Certain Brief Reasons concerning the Catholick Faith" (Douay, 1564); "A Defense and Declaration of the Catholike Churches Doctrine touching Purgatory, and Prayers of the Soules Departed" (Antwerp, 1565), re-edited by <a href="02782b.htm">Father Bridgett</a> in 1886; "A Treatise made in defense of the Lawful Power and Authoritie of the Preesthoode to remitte sinnes &amp;c." (1578); "De Sacramentis" (Antwerp, 1565; Douay, 1603); "An Apology for the English Seminaries" (1581); "Apologia Martyrum" (1583); "Martyrium R. P. Edmundi Campiani, S.J."
