<p>Born about the year 1135 at the castle of Avalon, near Pontcharra, in <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; died at <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, 16 Nov., 1200. His father, William, Lord of Avalon, was sprung from one of the noblest of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> houses; of his mother, Anna, very little is <a href="08673a.htm">known</a>. After his wife's death, William retired from the world to the Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Villard-Beno&icirc;t, near <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, and took his son Hugh, with him. Hugh became a religious and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> at the age of nineteen. In about the year 1159 he was sent as a prior to the cell, or dependent <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a>, of St-Maximin, not far from his ancestral home of Avalon, where his elder brother, William had succeeded his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>. At St-Maximin, Hugh laboured assiduously in preaching and whatever <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> might be discharged by a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Becoming more and more desirous to give himself to the complete contemplative life, he visited in company with the <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of Villard-Beno&icirc;t the solitude of the Grande Chartreuse. Dom Basil was then head of the Chartreuse, and to him Hugh confided his desire of submitting to the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> rule. To test his vocation the prior refused him any encouragement, and his own superior, alarmed at the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of losing the flower of his community, took him back quickly to Villard-Beno&icirc;t, and made him <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> to give up his intention of joining the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>. He submitted and made the promise, acting, as his historian assures us, "in <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a> and purity of intention, placing his confidence in <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and trusting that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> would bring about his deliverance"; his call to a higher life was yet <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, his obedience to one who was still his superior was a certain <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, and not a "sinful act", as thinks his modern <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> biographer. Realizing that his <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a>, made without proper deliberation and under strongest emotion, was not binding, he returned to the Grande Chartreuse as a <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> in 1153. Soon after his profession the prior entrusted him with the care of a very old and infirm <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> from whom he received the instruction <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to prepare him for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. He was probably <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> at thirty, the age then required by canon law. When he had been ten years a <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> he was entrusted with the important and difficult office of <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a>, which he retained till the year 1180, leaving the Grande Chartreuse then to become <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of Witham in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, the first <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> house in that country. It was situated in Somerset and had been founded by Henry II in compensation for his having failed to go on the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> imposed as a penance for the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> of <a href="14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>. The first two <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a> had succumbed to the terrible hardships encountered at the new foundation, where the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> had not even a roof to cover them, and it was by the special request of the English king that <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>, whose fame had reached him through one of the nobles of Maurienne, was made prior. His first attention was given to the building of the Charterhouse. He prepared his plans and submitted them for royal <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a>, exacting full compensation from the king for any tenants on the royal estate who would have to be evicted to make room for the building. Long delay was occasioned by the king's parsimony, but the Charterhouse, an exact copy of the Grande Chartreuse, was at last finished. Henry placed the greatest confidence in <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>, frequently visiting Witham, which was on the borders of Selwood forest, one of the monarch's favourite hunting-places. The saint was fearless in reproving Henry's faults, especially his violation of the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. His keeping of sees vacant in order to appropriate their revenues, and the royal interference in elections to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> posts evoked the sternest reproach from <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In May, 1180, Henry summoned a council of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and barons at Eynsham Abbey to deliberate on the affairs of the state in general. The filling of vacant <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> was determined on, and, among others, the canons of Lincoln, who had been without a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for about sixteen years, were ordered to hold an election. After some discussion, their choice fell on the king's nominee, Hugh, <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of Witham. He refused the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> because the election had not been free. A second election was held with due observance of canon law &mdash; this time at Lincoln, and not in the king's private <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> &mdash; and Hugh, though chosen unanimously, still refused the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> till the <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Grande Chartreuse, his superior, had given his consent. This being obtained by a special embassy in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in St. Catherine's <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, <a href="15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>, on 21 September, 1186, by <a href="02221b.htm">Archbishop Baldwin of Canterbury</a>. He was <a href="05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in Lincoln <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on 29 Sept. The new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at once set to the work of reform. He attacked the iniquitous forest <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the king's chief forester. In addition to this, and almost at the same time, he refused to install a courtier whom Henry had recommended as a <a href="12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of Lincoln. The king summoned him to appear at Woodstock, where the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> softened the enraged monarch by his ready wit, making him approve of his forester's <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and the refusal of his <a href="12371a.htm">prebend's</a> stall. He soon became conspicuous for his unbounded charity to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and it was long remembered how he used to tend with his own hands people afflicted with <a href="09182a.htm">leprosy</a> then so common in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. He was a model episcopate. He rarely left the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, became personally acquainted with the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, held regular canonical visitations, and was most careful to chose worthy men for the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; his canons were to reside in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and if not present at Lincoln were to appoint vicars to take their place at the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. Once a year he retired to Witham to give himself to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, far from the work and turmoil of his great diocese.</p>

<p>In July, 1188, he went on an embassy to the French king, and was in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> at the time of Henry's death. He returned the following year and was present at <a href="13041b.htm">Richard I's</a> <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>; in 1191 he was in conflict with Longchamp, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05396a.htm">Ely</a> and justiciar, whose <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> commands he refused to obey, and in 1194-5 was a prominent defender of Archbishop Geoffrey of York, in the dispute between that <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> and his chapter. Hugh was also prominent in trying to protect the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, great numbers of whom lived in Lincoln, in the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> they suffered at the beginning of Richard's reign, and he put down popular <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> against them in several places. In <a href="13041b.htm">Richard I</a> Hugh found a more formidable <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> to deal with than his predecessor had been. His <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> demands, however, he was resolute in opposing. In a council held at <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, in 1198, the justiciar, Archbishop Hubert, asked from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and barons a large grant of money and a number of <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a> for the king's foreign <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>. Hugh refused on the ground that he was not bound to furnish money or soldiers for <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> undertaken outside of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. His example was followed by Herbert of <a href="13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, and the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> had to yield. Richard flew into one of his fits of rage, and ordered the confiscation of Hugh's <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, but no one dared to lay hands on it. The saint journeyed to <a href="11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, met Richard at Chateau-Gaillard and, having won the monarch's forgiveness and admiration by his extraordinary <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, proceeded to rebuke him fearlessly for his faults &mdash; his infidelity to his wife, and encroachments on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. "Truly", said Richard to his courtiers, "if all the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> were like him, there is not a king in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> who would dare to raise his head in the presence of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>." Once more <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> had to oppose Richard in his demands. This time it was claim for money from the chapter of Lincoln. Crossing again to Normandy he arrived just before the king's death, and was present at his obsequies at <a href="06129b.htm">Fontevrault</a>. He attended John's <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> at <a href="15598a.htm">Westminster</a> in May, 1199, but was soon back in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> aiding the king in the affairs of state. He visited the Grande Chartreuse in the summer of 1200 and was received everywhere on the journey with tokens of extraordinary respect and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. While returning to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> he was attacked by a fever, and died a few months afterwards at the Old Temple, the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> residence of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lincoln. The <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> performed his obsequies in Lincoln <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and King John assisted in carrying the coffin to its resting-place in the north-east <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a>. In 1220 he was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, and his remains were solemnly translated in 1280 to a conspicuous place in the great south <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a>. A magnificent golden shrine contained his <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>, and Lincoln became the most celebrated centre of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in the north of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. It is not known what became of <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh's</a> <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> at the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; the shrine and its wealth were a tempting bait to <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, who confiscated all its gold, silver and precious stones, "with which all the simple people be moch deceaved and broughte into greate supersticion and idolatrye". <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh's</a> feast is kept on 17 November. In the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian Order</a> he is second only to <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, and the great modern Charterhouse at Parkminster, in Sussex, is dedicated to him.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Like most of the great <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> who came to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> from abroad, <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> was a mighty builder. He rebuilt Lincoln <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, ruined by the great earthquake of 1185 and, though much of the minister which towers over Lincoln is of later date, <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> is responsible for the for the four bays of the choir, one of the finest examples of the Early English pointed style. He also began the great hall of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace. <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh's</a> emblem is a white swan, in reference to the beautiful story of the swan of Stowe which contracted a deep and lasting friendship for the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, even guarding him while he slept.</p>
