It became necessary, therefore, to seek education abroad, and many colleges for the training of the secular clergy were founded on the Continent, at Rome, in Spain and Portugal, in Belgium, and in France">

<h2>In Spain and Portugal</h2>

<h3>Salamanca</h3>

<p>The most famous of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> was that of Salamanca, founded, at the petition of Father Thomas White, S.J., by a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of Philip III, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 1592, and opened in 1593 with the title: El Real Colegio de Nobles Irlandeses. The support of the students was provided for by a royal endowment. The discipline and management of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was entrusted to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a> at Salamanca, an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> father holding the office of vice-rector. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> continued to govern the college until the order was expelled from <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1767. Since that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> the rectors of the college have been selected from amongst the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, presented by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and confirmed by the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Dr. Birmingham was the first <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> after the departure of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Dr. Curtis, subsequently <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Armagh, held office from 1781 to 1812, and rendered valuable service to the Duke of <a href="15580a.htm">Wellington</a> during the Peninsular War. In more recent years, Dr. William McDonald, of the Diocese of Armagh, Father Cowan, of <a href="05160a.htm">Dromore</a>, Father Bernard Maguire, of Cloghger have been rectors. That office is presently held by the Very Rev. Michael O'Doherty, D. D., a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> from the Diocese of Achonry. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college at Salamanca was open to students from all the provinces of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but in the seventeenth century, the majority of them came from the southern and eastern provinces. It was made cause of complaint that Father White, S.J., was unwilling to receive students from Ulster and Connaught, and the exiled <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> chiefs, O'Neill and O'Donnell, presented a remonstrance on the subject to the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The students attended lectures in the famous <a href="13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>, and the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was the nursing mother of many eminent <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Dr. Curtis of Armagh, <a href="10646b.htm">Dr. Murray</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, Dr. Kelley of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, Dr. Laffan, and Dr. Everard of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a> were all alumni of Salamanca, the last four being fellow-students. At present the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students at Salamanca number about thirty, and attend lectures at the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> which has taken the place of the <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> faculty of the ancient <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. The college is supported chiefly by ancient endowments, which are subject to the control of the Spanish Government.</p>

<h3>Seville</h3>

<p>About 1612 a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> for <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students was established at <a href="13744a.htm">Seville</a>, and managed by <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, one of whom was <a href="14249a.htm">Theobald Stapleton</a>, who afterwards died a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, being stabbed while administering <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. In 1619, Father Richard Conway, S.J., was appointed <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. When he entered upon office, the personnel of the college &mdash; superiors, students, and servants &mdash; numbered eighteen. They suffered much from poverty. Their condition moved many to compassion. The fishermen at Seville obtained an <a href="07789a.htm">indult</a> from <a href="11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>, permitting them to fish on six <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holidays each year in order that they might gave the profits of their labour for the support of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students. For the same purpose <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> merchants at Seville granted to the college a percentage on every cask of wine they sold. Soldiers in the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Brigade of the Spanish service gave a portion of their pay. With such aid the college continued to exist and was able to send every year two <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> mission. One of the students of the college, Dominic Lynch, became president in the <a href="13746a.htm">University of Seville</a>. In 1769, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college at <a href="13744a.htm">Seville</a>, with all its goods, rents, and <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, was, by royal authority, amalgamated with that of Salamanca.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3>Madrid</h3>

<p>In 1629 a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> for <a href="08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> was founded by <a href="14249a.htm">Father Theobald Stapleton</a>, who has already been mentioned in connection with the college at Seville. The number of students varied from ten to twenty, supported by the charity of benefactors. The college served as a hospice for those <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who, having completed their studies, came to the capital to claim the bounty of &pound;10 which the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> had granted to <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students in the peninsula, to enable them to return to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In 1677, Dr. James Lynch, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, resided for some time at <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a> and succeeded in restoring the college to greater prosperity. but eventually it was closed, and its <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> lost to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.</p>

<h3>Alcal&aacute;</h3>

<p>In Alcal&aacute;, anciently Complutum, famous for its <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, and for its polyglot edition of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college was founded in 1590, by a Portuguese nobleman named George Sylveira, a descendant, though his mother, of the Macdonnells of Ulster. He bestowed on the college an endowment of the value of &pound;2000, and, at a cost of &pound;1000, built a <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> to his patron, <a href="06453a.htm">St. George</a>. At Alcal&aacute; there were four masters, twenty students, and eight students. The ancient college has long since ceased to exist.</p>

<h3>Santiago de Compostela</h3>

<p>In 1605 a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> for <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> was founded at <a href="04187b.htm">Compostela</a>. Philip III bestowed upon it an endowment of &pound;100 a year. It was under the direction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1671 there were six students. At the conclusion of the philosophy course all went to Salamanca for their <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. In 1769 the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the college at <a href="13460a.htm">Santiago</a> de Compostela was amalgamated with that of the college at Salamanca.</p>

<h3>Lisbon</h3>

<p>Besides the college in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> there existed also an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> establishment in <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The college was founded by Royal Charter in 1593, under the title: Collegio de Estudiantes Irlandeses sub invoca&ccedil;aon de San Patricio en Lisboa. Like the other <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges in the peninsula it was placed under the management of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The celebrated <a href="15612c.htm">Stephan White, S. J.</a>, was one of its earliest pupils. During the great earthquake which almost destroyed the city of <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1755, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college and its inmates suffered no injury. Not long after it suffered from the malice of men. In 1769 it was closed and confiscated by <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal</a>, under the pretext that it was a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> establishment. But in 1782, an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, Dr. Michael Brady, succeeded in having the college restored to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>. Dr. Brady was succeeded in the office of <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> by Dr. Bartholomew Crotty, subsequently president of Maynooth, and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04072a.htm">Cloyne</a>. Dr. Crotty held the office of <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> from 1801 to 1811. During his tenure of office, an invitation was addressed by Dr. John Baptist Walsh, <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to the students in <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, to come to his college at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, an invitation of which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> expressed their disapproval. The number of students in the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college as <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> during the eighteenth century was from twelve to fourteen. During the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> it increased to thirty or forty, to fall again to fourteen after 1815. Dr. Burke, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, Dr. Talbot, Dr. Russell, and Dr. Carpenter, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>; Dr. Verdun, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06045a.htm">Ferns</a>, and Dr. Kelly, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Waterford, were <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> students. During the civil <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> in <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, during the nineteenth century, the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was closed, and has not since been reopened.</p>

<p>Besides the colleges for <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> at <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> there was also a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers, and a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, both of which exist at the present day, the former at Corpo Santo, <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, and the latter at Belem in the vicinity.</p>

<h2>In Belgium</h2>

<h3>Louvain</h3>

<p>While the colleges in the Peninsula were doing good services for the preservation of the Faith in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, other colleges for the same purpose were established in <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. In 1624, a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, with the title "Collegium Pastorale", was founded at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, in virtue of a charter granted by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, at the instance of the Most Rev. Eugene Macmahon, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> gave a donation for the support of the college, and the <a href="12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a> bestowed on it an allowance of 240 scudi. Burses were also founded by various benefactors, the aggregate value of which amounted to 73, 217 flourins. The first <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was Nicholas Aylmer. The students at the first commencement were six in number. In 1643 there were four <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and six students in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. At the close of the eighteenth century the number had increased to forty. Many distinguished <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were students of the pastoral college at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. One of its rectors, <a href="14249b.htm">Thomas Stapleton</a>, held also the office of <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> for seven terms.</p>

<p>Besides the secular colleges, <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> for the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were established at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. Of these the most ancient and the most celebrated was the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> College of St. Anthony of Padua, founded in 1606 at the request of <a href="04261c.htm">Florence Conry</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>. The number of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> at St. Anthony's in the seventeenth century was about forty. In this <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> lived John Cogan, the celebrated <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> hagiologist, author of the "Trias Thaumaturga" and of "Lives of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Saints." Here, too, lived <a href="15550a.htm">Hugh Ward</a>, Father Mooney, Brendan O'Connor, and Bonaventure O'Doherty, who so ably assisted Michael O'Cleary in collecting materials for the great work known as the "Annals of the Four Masters". The <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of St. Anthony's did great work to the cause of religion by printing books of instruction in the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> tongue. At <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> were printed the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a> of <a href="11228c.htm">Bonaventure O'Hussey</a> (1608), "The Mirror of Penance" by Hugh MacCaughwell (1618), "The Mirror of Religion" by <a href="04261c.htm">Florence Conry</a> (1626), O'Cleary's vocabulary (1643), "The <a href="14519a.htm">Paradise</a> of the Soul" by Anthony Gernon (1645), and a moral treatise in English and <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> by <a href="01694a.htm">Richard MacGiollacuddy (Arsdekin)</a> (1667). It has been truly said of the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, "No <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> college has maintained with more <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> than this, the character of the order as expressed in their motto, <em>Doctrina et Scientia</em>." At the close of the eighteenth century, the number of <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> at St. Anthony's was seventeen. In 1796 the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was closed to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and sold. There existed also at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, founded in 1608, known as the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Holy Cross. A letter of the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, in 1675, gave the names of thirty-three <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who had gone from Holy Cross to labour in the mission in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> was closed in 1797. A <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> was established at Ypres in 1682, where for more than two centuries <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> aspiring to religious perfection found a home. This <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> has survived to the present day (1910). The colleges, <a href="13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="12722c.htm">regular</a>, at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> during two centuries of their existence gave to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> 32 <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and about 300 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, at least 200 of which were graduates in arts at the <a href="09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>.</p>

<h3>Antwerp</h3>

<p>In 1629 a pastoral college was founded at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> by the Rev. Laurence Selgrave, a Leinster <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, who, together with his nephew, the Rev. James Talbot, expended 13,220 flourins on the establishment of a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> and became its first <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, as his nephew became its second. After their time the college suffered much from poverty and was on the point of being closed and sold to meet the claims of creditors. But during the rectorate of John Egan, prothonotary Apostolic, it received a fresh impulse. Donations were received, and creditors satisfied. Through the pro-nuncio at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> sent subventions from time to time. The number of students, usually about twelve, increased eventually to thirty. They attended lectures at the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, where their distinguished countryman, <a href="01694a.htm">Fr. Richard Archdeacon (Arsdekin), S.J.</a>, died in 1690. The pastoral colleges at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> continued to flourish until 1795, when they were closed due to the occupation of <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> by the French. At various times the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> made representations to the <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Government with a view to obtain the transfer of the burses to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and they have been so far successful that at the present time the annual revenue of the burses is paid through the medium of the British Foreign Office for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of students at <a href="10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>.</p>

<h3>Tournai</h3>

<p>An <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college was founded at <a href="14798a.htm">Tournai</a> by Christopher Cusack. In 1689 there were eight <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> at <a href="14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, with an income of 200 scudi. <a href="03695a.htm">Choiseul</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, in a letter to <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>, speaks thus of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college: "We have here a College or Seminary of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> youth where some poor students are supported, receive a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and are taught the Humanities. They attend the classes at the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and are generally the first in merit." The Tournai college, like those at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and Antwerp, was closed in 1795. In 1833, at the insistence of the Most Rev. Dr. O'Higgins, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01699c.htm">Ardagh</a>, the <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Government consented to transfer to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the sum of 4000 francs from the funds of the old <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college at <a href="14798a.htm">Tournai</a>,</p>

<h2>In France</h2>

<p>The colleges in the Peninsula and in <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a> rendered greats service to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. but the most important of all the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges on the continent were those established in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<h3>Douai</h3>

<p>The most ancient among these was the college at <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a>, founded about 1577 by Reverend Ralph Cusack. <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> was then included in the <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a> territory subject to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and in about 1604 Philip III conferred on the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in that town an endowment of 5000 flourins. In 1667 <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> was taken by <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college there became subject to French authority. For some years the means of subsistence were scanty and precarious, but in 1750 the college recovered its prosperity. It was subject to a board of provisors who nominated the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> from a list of three candidates provided by the superiors of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The students, about thirty in number, attended lectures at the <a href="05138a.htm">University of Douai</a>. In 1793 the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was closed, and in 1795 the buildings, valued at 60,000 francs, were alienated by the French Government.</p>

<h3>Lille</h3>

<p>An <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college was founded at <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a> by Ralph Cusack in virtue of letters patents granted in 1610 by Archduke Albert, and Isabella, Infanta of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the Governors of the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. Foundations were made for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of students from the Province of Leinster, more particularly for those from <a href="10097a.htm">Meath</a>. The right of nominating the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> was vested in the superior of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at Bar-su-Aube. The college suffered much from poverty. Its means of support were derived partly from collections made at church doors, and partly from fees received for the services the students rendered by carrying the dead at funerals. The study and use of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> language was encouraged, and no one unacquainted to that tongue was eligible to the office of <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. The students numbered from eight to ten, exclusively from Leinster. The college, which was valued at 20,000 francs, was confiscated and sold in 1793.</p>

<h3>Bordeaux</h3>

<p>In 1603 the Rev. Dermit MacCarthy, a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="04370b.htm">Diocese of Cork</a>, made his way to <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> with about forty companions. These <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> exiles were hospitably received by Cardinal de Surdis, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, who gave them a house and place them in charge of the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Eutropius. The rules of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> community were approved by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> in 1603, and again in 1609, and were finally ratified by <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, in the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In supremo apostolic&aelig; dignitatus", 26 April, 1618. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students at <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, like those from <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a>, derived their support from <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> collected at the doors of churches in the city, and from fees received from their services at funerals. In 1653, at the conclusion of the War of the Fronde, about 5000 <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> troops, previously in the service of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, at the suggestion of Father Cornelius O'Scanlan, <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college at <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, elected to take service under the flag of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. In acknowledgement of the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Father O'Scanlan for the interests of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the queen regent, Anne of Austria, bestowed on the college an endowment of 1200 livres in support of twelve <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and ten <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and conferred on the students the right of naturalization to enable them to receive gifts and possess <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> in the kingdom. On the same occasion the title of "Sainte-Anne-la-Royale" was given to the college. Besides the endowment of Anne of Austria, various bequests were made by benefactors; yet in 1766 the total annual revenue of the college amounted to only 2531 francs. From twenty in the seventeenth century the number of students increased, in the eighteenth, to thirty, and eventually to forty. They attended classes at the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> in the city. There were also little colonies of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students at <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="02067c.htm">Auch</a>, <a href="01209b.htm">Agen</a>, <a href="03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, Condom, and P&eacute;riguaux, all subject to the authority of the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college at <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. The <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was chosen by the votes of the students, and confirmed by the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> for a period of three years. The system of appointment by election led to frequent disputes and was eventually abolished. Dr. Robert Barry, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04072a.htm">Cloyne</a>, Dr. Patrick Comerford, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Waterford, Dr. Cornelius O'Keefe and Dr. Robert Lacy, Bishops of <a href="09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, Dr. Dominic Bellew, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08640a.htm">Killala</a>, and Dr. Boetius Egan, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, were some time students at <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. Here, too, Geoffrey Keating is said to have been a student. The <a href="05283a.htm">Abb&eacute; Edgeworth</a> and Dr. Richard O'Reilly, subsequently <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Armagh, studied for a short time at <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, whence the former proceeded to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the latter to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The last superior of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was the Rev. Martin Glynn, D. D., a native of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, who suffered death by sentence of the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolutionary</a> tribunal, at <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, 19 July, 1794. The vice-rector of the college, Dr. Everard, escaped. The students were thrown into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, but were eventually liberated and put on board a vessel bound for <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The college church, valued at 21,000 francs, was confiscated in 1793. The college was also seized but was saved from confiscation by the vigilance of an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> named James Burke. After the <a href="13009a.htm">revolution</a>, all that remained of the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the college at <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> was placed by <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the first consul under the control of the board of administrators of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1885 the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> at <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> was sold for 285,635 francs and the price invested in French securities in the name of the "Foundation Catholiques Irlandaises en <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>".</p>

<h3>Toulouse</h3>

<p>From the commencement of the seventeenth century, there existed at <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> a little colony of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in that town owes its origin to Anne of Austria, who bestowed upon it, at the same time as upon the college at <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, the title of "Sainte-Anne-la-Royale", with an endowment of 1200 livres a year for the support of twelve <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. The endowment was confirmed by <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> in 1659. At <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> the number of students never exceeded ten or twelve, chiefly natives of the province of Munster. Small though the number was, the system of appointing the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> by the votes of the students led to division, and it was judged expedient to submit the rules of discipline to <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, who approved them by a letter addressed to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> on 31 August, 1753. The course of studies extended over a period of eight years, after which the students returned to the mission in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. When the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> broke out, the college possessed an annual revenue of 10,000 francs. In 1793, the college building and furniture, valued at 36,700 francs, were confiscated, and sold by the French Government.</p>

<h3>Nantes</h3>

<p>Nantes, on the coast of Brittany, was also the seat of an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college founded about 1680. In 1728 a new and more commodious college was constructed, and in 1765, by royal letters patent, the <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of St-Crispin was united with it. The number of students, at first about thirty-six, increased to sixty in 1765, and by 1792 it had reached eighty. The college was subject to the University of <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, but it had its own professors &mdash; two for philosophy and two for <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> &mdash; who were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> each term to report to the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> the name of their students and the treatises they were to explain. The last <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was Dr. Patrick Byrne, subsequently president of <a href="10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>. In 1793 the students of the college were cast into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> and then put on board a vessel which brought them in safety to <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>. The college was not reopened in the nineteenth century. The buildings which escaped alienation were placed under the control of the administration of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. They were sold, with the sanction of the Minister of Public Instruction, in 1857, and the proceeds of the sale (100,000 francs) invested in the name of the "Foundation Catholiques Irlandaises"</p>

<h3>Poitiers</h3>

<p>A college of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> was founded at <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, in virtue of letters patent granted by <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, in April, 1674. Five burses for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of students for the <a href="13675a.htm">secular priesthood</a> were founded here, two in 1738 by Mrs. John Maher, an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> lady resident at <a href="02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, and three by Jeremy Crowley, at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, in 1735. On the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the five burses were transferred to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The college buildings, valued at about 10,500 francs, were alienated by the French Government. The Abb&eacute; Thomas Gould was a student at this college; known as the missionary of Poitou he preached with great success in French, and published several works in that language.</p>

<p>The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> had <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> in provincial <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, at Bar-su-Aube, at Sedan, and at Charleville, and for some years a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>.</p>

<h3>Paris</h3>

<p>The most important of all the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> establishments in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and on the Continent, was the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. That venerable institution, which has preserved its existence to the present day, owe its origin the Reverend John Lee, an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> who came to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1578, with six companions, and entered the Coll&egrave;ge Montaigu. Having completed his studies he became attached to the Church of St. Severin, and made the acquaintance of a French nobleman, John de l'Escalopier, President of the Parliament of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. That charitable man placed at the disposal of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> a house, which served them as a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a>, of which Father Lee became the first <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> about 1605. By letters patent <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 1623, Louis XIII conferred upon the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and scholars in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to receive and possess <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college was recognized as a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> by the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> in 1624, and at that time it had already sent a large number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to the mission in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. But the college founded by Father Lee was not spacious enough to receive the numerous <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students who came to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Some of them continued to find a home in the Coll&egrave;ge Montaigu, others in the Coll&egrave;ge de Boncour, while some, who were in affluent circumstances, resided in the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre. This state of things attracted the attention of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> and others, who sought to provide them with a more commodious residence. Later still, in 1672, it engaged the attention of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, who deputed Dr. John O'Mollony, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08641a.htm">Killaloe</a>, to treat with <a href="04096a.htm">Colbert</a> as to the establishment of a new college. What the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> desired was eventually obtained, through the influence of two <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> resident in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>: Dr. Patrick Maginn, formerly first <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Queen Catherine, wife of Charles II of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and Dr. Malachy Kelly, one of the <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. These two <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> obtained from <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> authorization to enter on possession of the Coll&egrave;ge des Lombards, a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> founded for Italian students in 1333. They rebuilt the college, then in ruins, at their own expense, and became its first superiors. The acquisition of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was confirmed by letters patent <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 1677 and 1681. Some years later the buildings were extended by Dr. John Farely, and all the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> found a home in the Coll&egrave;ge des Lombards. The number of students went on increasing until, in 1764, it reached one hundred and sixty. It was therefore found <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to build a second college. The building was commenced in 1769 in rue du Cheval Vert, now rue du Irlandais, and the junior section of the students was transferred to the new college in 1776.</p>

<p>The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> was open to all the counties and provinces in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The students were divided into two categories, one, the more numerous, consisting of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> already <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the other of juniors aspiring to orders. Both sections attended the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> classes, either at the Coll&egrave;ge de Plessis, or at that of <a href="10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, or at the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. The course of study extended over six years, of which two were given to philosophy, three to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, and one to special preparation for pastoral work. The more talented students remained two years longer to qualify for degrees in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or in canon law. In virtue of the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, "Piis Christi fidelium", <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 July, 1626, and granted in favour of all <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges already established or to be established in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, or elsewhere, the junior students were promoted to orders <em>ad titulum missionis in Hiberni&acirc;</em>, even <em>extra tempora</em>, and without dimissorial letters, on the representation of the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college &mdash; a privilege withdrawn, as regards dimissorial letters, by <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in 1835, and now entirely abrogated by transfer of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Consistorial Congregation in 1908. The students in <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> orders were able to support themselves to a large extent by their Mass stipends. Many burses, too, were founded for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of students at the Lombard college. Among the founders were nine <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, thirty-two <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, four medical <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>, some <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> engaged in civil or military pursuits, and a few <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> ladies. The college was governed in the eighteenth century by four <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> called provisors, one from each province of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. They were elected by the votes of the students, and confirmed by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, who, as <em>superior major</em>, nominated one of them to the office of principal. In 1788, the system of government by provisors was abolished, and one <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> appointed.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1792 the two <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, namely the Coll&egrave;ge des Lombards, and the junior college, rue du Cheval Vert, were closed, as were all the other <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The closing of the colleges on the Continent deprived the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> of the means of <a href="05295b.htm">educating</a> their <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. They therefore petitioned the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> Government for authorization to establish an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college at home. The petition was granted, and <a href="10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a> was founded in 1795. In support of their petition the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> submitted a statement of the number of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> receiving <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> on the Continent when the <a href="13009a.htm">French revolution</a> began.</p>

<p>From this statement is appears that out of a total of 478 <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> receiving <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> on the Continent, 348 were resident in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and of these, 180 were students in the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, forty students of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> were raised to the episcopal bench. At the same period <a href="08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> held an honourable place at the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. Between 1660 and 1730 more than sixty <a href="08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> held the office of <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the German nation &mdash; one of the four sections of the <a href="01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> in the ancient <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. <a href="10553a.htm">Dr. Michael Moore</a>, an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, long held the office of principal of the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre, and was twice elected <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. Many <a href="08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> held chairs in the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. Dr. Sleyne was professor at the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. Dr. Power was professor of the college at Lisieux; Dr. O'Lonergan at the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Dr. John Plunkett, Dr. Patrick J. Plunkett, and Dr. Flood, superiors or provisors of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college, were in succession royal professors of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre. The students of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> were pronounced opponents of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. When they returned to their native land, they, like the students of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Salamanca, and <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, brought with them "the manners and feelings of cultivated gentlemen and a high sense of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> decorum".</p>

<p>After the <a href="13009a.htm">French revolution</a>, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> was re-established by a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the first consul, and placed under the control of a board appointed by the French Government. To it were united the remnants of the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the other <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> which had escaped destruction. The college in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> lost two-thirds of its endowments owing to the depreciation of French state funds, which had been reduced to one-third consolidated. The total loss sustained by all the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> foundations in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> amounted to 2,416,410 francs, or about $438,000. After the Restoration, the French Government placed at the disposal of the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> government three million and a half sterling, to indemnify British subjects in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> for the losses they had sustained in the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. In 1816 a claim for indemnity was presented on behalf of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college. That claim was rejected by the privy council in 1825 on the grounds that the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was a French establishment. In 1832 the claim was renewed by Dr. M'Sweeny, director of the college, with the same result. Another attempt to obtain compensation was made by the Rev. Thomas McNamara in 1870. On 9 May in that year a motion was made in the House of Lords for copies of the awards in the case of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college in 1825 and 1832. This step was followed up by a motion in the House of Commons for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the claims of the college to compensation for losses sustained during the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. The motion was introduced on 30 April, 1875, by Isaac Butt, M. P. for Limerick, and, after a prolonged discussion, it was negatived by 116 to 54 votes.</p>

<p>After 1805 the administration of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was subject to a "Bureau de Surveillance" which gave much trouble until it was dissolved by Charles X, in 1824. After that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, the superior, appointed on presentation of the four <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, became official administrator of the foundations, subject to the minister of the interior, and at a later period to the minister of public instruction. The students no longer frequented the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. The professors were <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> appointed by the French Government on the presentation of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> episcopate. In 1858, with the sanction of the <a href="12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>, and with the consent of the French Government, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> placed the management of college in the hands of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> Fathers. In recent years the number of students has been between sixty and seventy. They are admitted on <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and, after a course of two years in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and four years in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, they are <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> and returned to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In the nineteenth century the college gave to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> a long array of good <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, including Dr. Fitz Patrick, Abbott of Melleray; <a href="16059a.htm">Dr. Maginn</a>, Coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04742a.htm">Derry</a>; Dr. Keane, of <a href="04072a.htm">Cloyne</a>; Dr. O'Hea and Dr. Fitz Gerald of <a href="13201a.htm">Ross</a>; Dr. Gillooly of <a href="05394b.htm">Elphin</a>, and <a href="04514b.htm">Dr. Croke</a> of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a>. Dr. Kelly, the present <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13201a.htm">Ross</a>, and Dr. McSherry, <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> at Port Elizabeth, South Africa, are also alumni of the college. The present occupant of the <a href="01729a.htm">see of St. Patrick</a>, H. E. Cardinal Logue, held the chair of <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> from 1866 to 1874.</p>

<p>In the three hundred years of its existence, the college has not been without a share in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Among the rectors of the college have been <a href="10217a.htm">Thomas Messingham</a>, prothonotary Apostolic, author of the "Florilegium Insul&aelig; Sanctorum" (Paris, 1624); <a href="05131a.htm">Dr. Andrew Donlevy</a>, author of an "Anglo-Irish Catechism" (Paris, 1742); Dr. Miley, author of "A History of the Papal States" (Dublin, 1852); Dr. Thomas McNamara, author of "Programmes of Sermons" (Dublin, 1880), "Encheiridion Clericorum" (1882), and several other similar works. Abb&eacute; Mageoghegan, Sylvester O'Hallaran, Martin Haverty, and probably Geoffrey Keating, all eminent <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> historians, were students of the college. Dean Kinane, a student and then a professor in the college, is widely known for his "Dove of the Tabernacle" and numerous other devotional works. More recently, the Rev. John MacGuinness, C. M., vice-rector, has published a full course of <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>. Amongst the rectors of the college, Dr. John Farley and Dr. John Baptist Walsh, in the eighteenth century, and Dr. MacSweeney and the Rev. Thomas MacNamara, in the nineteenth, have been administrators of marked ability. Since 1873 the administration of the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the college has been invested in a board created by a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Conseil d'Etat. On that board the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> was represented by a delegate, and he was also the official medium of communication between the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> episcopate and the French Government. In December, 1906, the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of separation of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> came into operation. In the January following, the French government notified the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> Government of its intention to reorganize the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> foundations in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> so as to bring them into harmony with the recent legislation regarding the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was further stated that the purpose of the Government was to close the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> college, to sell its immovable <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, and to invest the proceeds of the sale, to be applied together with the existing burses for the benefit of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students who shall be admitted, on the presentation to the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> Ambassador to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, either to the state <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> or to the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> which have taken the place of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. A plea for the preservation of the college has been presented on behalf of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, through the British Foreign office. The question is still undecided.</p>

<p>The history of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges on the Continent is a manifest <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the tenacity with which <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> has clung to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. Without the succession of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> prepared in these colleges, the preservation of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries would have been impossible. At the present day the colleges in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> are sufficient to supply the needs of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but the colleges on the Continent are still useful as a <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> of the past, and they serve to bring a large section of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> into contact with the life and thought and work of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the ancient <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nations on the Continent.</p>
