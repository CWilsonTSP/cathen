<p><a href="14580a.htm">Theologian</a> and principal adversary of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, b. 15 Nov., 1486, at Eck in Swabia; d. 10 Feb., 1543, at <a href="08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. His family name was Maier, and his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, Michael Maier, was for many years magistrate in the town, the latinized name of which, <em>Eckius</em> or <em>Eccius</em>, was adopted after 1505 by Johann. His uncle, Martin Maier, <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Rothenburg on the Neckar, received Johann in his house (1495) and <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> him. In 1498, when twelve years old, he was admitted to the Heidelberg University; thence he went in 1499 to T&uuml;bingen where he received the degree of Master of Arts in 1501; then to Cologne and in 1502 to Freiburg in the Breisgau. After his graduation in the <a href="01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> he began the study of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, took courses at the same time in <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, physics, mathematics, and geography, joined the Humanistic movement, and in addition to Latin, learned Hebrew and Greek. Among his instructors at the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> were many distinguished scholars. His uncle now withdrew his allowance and Eck was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to earn his livelihood as a tutor while continuing his studies. In 1505 he was appointed <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <em>Artistenburse zum Pfau</em>, i.e., principal of the hall for students in arts at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, and received the degree of Bachelor of Theology; he lectured on the "Sentences" in 1506; was promoted to the licentiate in 1509; and in 1510, when twenty-four years old, he received the degree of Doctor of Theology. He had been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1508 with a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the age-requirement. Shortly after graduating as doctor, he was invited (1510) by the Dukes of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> to the professorship of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in Ingolstadt. He was appointed pro-chancellor of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> in 1512, and during his professorate of thirty-two years filled repeatedly the offices of dean, pro-rector, and <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>; he also served as <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and was appointed canon in <a href="05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>. At Freiburg and during his earlier years at <a href="08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, his literary activity was remarkable, not only in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> but also in other departments of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, as is evidenced by his writings which have been preserved partly in print and partly in <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> He engaged in geographical research and published a series of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works, some of which were to serve as textbooks in the <a href="01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a> at <a href="08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. In these writings he attempts to combine in a rational synthesis the advantages of the older philosophy with those of the new. His principal <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> work during this period, entitled "Chrysopassus", treats of <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a> with special reference to the <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of grace and <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a> which were so soon to become, in consequence of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> outbreak, the centre of sharp discussion. The tenor of this treatise, written when its author was only twenty-eight years old, evinces both confidence and modesty.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> appearance, and especially the Disputation at Leipzig (1519), formed the turning-point in Eck's <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> development and in his activity as a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>. Thenceforth he is a prominent figure in the history of that period. With a clear insight into the meaning of <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, he was the first to champion the cause of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> against <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>; and he became <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> ablest opponent, skilful, untiring, and thoroughly equipped in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The rest of his life was spent in conflict with the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. He defended the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, its doctrines and its institutions, in his writings, in public debates, in his speeches at the diets, and in his diplomatic missions. For the betterment of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life and the spread of genuine reform he laboured earnestly by preaching to the people and by insisting on the scientific <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. As a reply to <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> "theses" he wrote his "Obelisci", originally intended solely for the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>. Both <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> and Karlstadt answered bitterly and then it was agreed to submit the points at issue to the test of a public debate, which was held in <a href="09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, 27 June-15 July, 1519. Eck came off victorious, exposed <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and won over as a loyal adherent to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> standard, George, Duke of Saxony. During the same year he published several essays attacking the tenets of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, and grew steadily in prominence as an authority on <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions. In 1520 he visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to report on the condition of affairs in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and to secure the condemnation of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He submitted his essay on the Primacy of Peter to <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, was appointed prothonotary Apostolic, and was charged as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, along with two other <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a>, Aleander and Caracciolo, to carry out in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> the provisions of the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exsurge Domine", which <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> and condemned his 41 theses. The execution of this mandate was beset with difficulties on every side. Eck, through his "Epistola ad Carolum V" (1521), admonished Emperor Charles to enforce the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> ban. In the same year he went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> again, principally at the behest of the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> dukes for whom he acted as counsellor in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, and made a third visit to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1523. Meanwhile (1522) he had induced the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> dukes to publish an edict in defence of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. While in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he procured for the dukes, among other privileges, the power of enacting, independently of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, decrees for the moral reformation of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>; and furthermore the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to appropriate, for use against <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>, a fifth part of all church revenues.</p>

<p>Eck in the meantime combated <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> by his letters and essays. Between the years 1522 and 1526 he published eight voluminous treatises against <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>. Through his influence the <a href="08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a> retained its strictly <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> attitude and strenuously opposed the rising <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> institutions. Eck had also a considerable share in organizing the "Catholic Federation", founded 5 June, 1524, by the leaders in <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> for the purpose of safeguarding the ancient <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and enforcing the Edict of Worms. He also defended in numerous essays the traditional doctrines of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> against <a href="15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> and his adherents, and participated in the religious discussion in Baden (1526). When the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the "Augsburg Confession", defining their religious views, Eck headed the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> champions upon whom the refutation of the articles in this confession devolved. Together with Wimpina and Cochl&aelig;us he represented the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party at the conference (16 Aug.) between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> relative to the "Confessio" and its "Confutatio"; and as <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> he served on the sub-committee which canvassed the results of the conference. <a href="15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> also had presented at <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> a Confession of Faith and this Eck alone refuted. Eck then drew up 404 <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> theses upon which he challenged the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> to public debate. The challenge was not accepted; the only answer from the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party was a torrent of abuse. In the negotiations relative to the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, Eck was consulted by the emperor, <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, as well as by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, and was charged by the latter with preliminary work for the council. At the religious disputation in Worms (1540), Eck again appeared as the chief <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> representative and debated with <a href="10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> on the issues involved in the "Augsburg Confession". This discussion was continued during the Diet of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (1541) to which, besides Eck, the emperor delegated as spokesmen on the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, <a href="11787a.htm">Julius Pflug</a> and <a href="07036b.htm">Gropper</a>. Eck maintained clearly and decisively the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position, and quite disapproved the "Ratisbon Interim". He also went on a mission to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> in the interest of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. In 1529 the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> invited Eck and Cochl&aelig;us to the discussion at <a href="04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>; but neither appeared. Eck fully deserved the prominence gained by him during the struggle against <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. He was the most distinguished <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the time in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the most scholarly and <a href="06147a.htm">courageous</a> champion of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Frank and even in disposition, he was also inspired by a sincere <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>; but he showed none the less an intense self-consciousness and the jovial bluntness of speech which characterized the men of that day. His adversaries, lampooning him publicly, taxed him with drunkenness and immorality; but the general tone of the writings published against Eck and the readiness of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to <a href="03190c.htm">calumniate</a> their victorious opponent, arouse strong suspicion as to the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of these accusations and make them, so far as the evidence goes, altogether improbable. In rebuttal it should be noted that Eck received the Last Sacraments with exemplary <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, and that his funeral in the Frauenkirche at <a href="08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a> was marked by great solemnity.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As a writer Eck was prolific. His most important works are: "Loci communes adversus Lutherum et alios hostes ecclesiae" (Arguments against Luther and Other Enemies of the Church), printed first in 1525, 45th edition in 1576; essays on the Primacy of Peter, Penance, the <a href="10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, <a href="12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, etc. He also published numerous polemical writings against <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, <a href="03025d.htm">Bucer</a>, and other leaders of the new religious movements. He compiled the results of the numerous disputations in which he participated and the sermons he preached on various subjects. In 1539 he published a German version of the Scriptures, translating the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> from the original and adopting <a href="05410a.htm">Emser's</a> translation of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Eck, however, was abler as a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> than as a stylist. He also published a collection of most of his writings prior to 1535 entitled "Opera Johannis Eckii contra Ludderum in 5 partes" (Ingolstadt, 1530-1535). In this edition parts I-II contain his polemical writings on the Primacy, Penance, etc. against <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>; parts III-IV, his reports of the debates and his polemics against <a href="15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, Karlstadt, and <a href="03025d.htm">Bucer</a>; also the "Loci Communes", part V (4 vols.), his Latin sermons.</p>
