<p>By merit (<em>meritum</em>) in general is understood that <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward (<em>pr&oelig;mium, merces</em>) from him in whose service the work is done. By antonomasia, the word has come to designate also the good work itself, in so far as it deserves a reward from the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> in whose service it was performed.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> sense, a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> merit can only be a salutary act (<em>actus salutaris</em>), to which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in consequence of his infallible promise owes a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> reward, consisting ultimately in <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, which is the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. As the main purpose of this article is to vindicate the <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of the meritoriousness of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, the subject is treated under the four following heads:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>I. Nature of Merit;</li><li>II. Existence of Merit;</li><li>III. Conditions of Merit, and</li><li>IV. Objects of Merit.</li></ul></div>

<h2 id="section1">Nature of merit</h2>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>(a) If we analyse the definition given above, it becomes evident that the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of merit can be found only in works that are positively good, whilst bad works, whether they benefit or injure a third party, contain nothing but demerit (<em>demeritum</em>) and consequently deserve punishment. Thus the good workman certainly deserves the reward of his labour, and the thief deserves the punishment of his crime. From this it naturally follows that merit and reward, demerit and punishment, bear to each other the relation of deed and return; they are correlative terms of which one postulates the other. Reward is due to merit, and the reward is in proportion to the merit. This leads to the third condition, viz., that merit supposes two distinct <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, the one who acquires the merit and the other who rewards it; for the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of self-reward is just as contradictory as that of self-punishment. Lastly, the relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration the guiding norm can be only the virtue of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty (cf. <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#vrs6">Romans 11:6</a>). If, however, salutary acts can in virtue of the Divine <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> give the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to an eternal reward, this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace, and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace, as the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> emphatically declares (Sess. VI, cap. xvi, in <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 10th ed., Freiburg, 1908, n. 810): "the Lord . . . whose bounty towards all men is so great, that He will have the things, which are His own gifts, be their merits."</p>

<p>Ethics and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> clearly distinguish two kinds of merit:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Condign merit or merit in the strict sense of the word (<em>meritum ad&oelig;quatum sive de condigno</em>), and</li><li>congruous or quasi-merit (<em>meritum inad&oelig;quatum sive de congruo</em>).</li></ul></div>

<p>Condign merit supposes an equality between service and return; it is measured by commutative <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> (<em>justitia commutativa</em>), and thus gives a real claim to a reward. Congruous merit, owing to its inadequacy and the lack of intrinsic proportion between the service and the recompense, claims a reward only on the ground of equity. This early-scholastic distinction and terminology, which is already recognized in concept and substance by the <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> in their controversies with the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> and Semipelagians, were again emphasized by <a href="05271b.htm">Johann Eck</a>, the famous adversary of <a href="09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> (cf. Greying, "Joh. Eck als junger Gelehrter," M&uuml;nster, 1906, pp. 153 sqq.). The essential difference between <em>meritum de condigno</em> and <em>meritum de congruo</em> is based on the fact that, besides those works which claim a remuneration under pain of violating strict <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> (as in contracts between employer and employee, in buying and selling, etc.), there are also other meritorious works which at most are entitled to reward or <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> for reasons of equity (<em>ex &oelig;quitate</em>) or mere distributive <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> (<em>ex iustitia distributiva</em>), as in the case of gratuities and military decorations. From an <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> point of view the difference practically amounts to this that, if the reward due to condign merit be withheld, there is a violation of right and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and the consequent <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> in <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> to make restitution, while, in the case of congruous merit, to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to restore, it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination (<em>acceptio personarum</em>). Hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver, though not purely and simply on his good will.</p>

<p>In applying these notions of merit to man's relation to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> it is especially <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to keep in mind the fundamental <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> that the virtue of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> cannot be brought forward as the basis of a real title for a Divine reward either in the natural or in the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. The simple reason is that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, being self-existent, absolutely independent, and sovereign, can be in no respect bound in <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> with regard to his creatures. Properly speaking, man possesses nothing of his own; all that he has and all that he does is a <a href="06553a.htm">gift of God</a>, and, since <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="08004a.htm">infinitely</a> self-sufficient, there is no advantage or benefit which man can by his services confer upon Him. Hence on the part of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> there can only be question of a gratuitous promise of reward for certain <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>. For such works He owes the promised reward, not in <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> or equity, but solely because He has freely bound himself, i.e., because of His own attributes of <a href="15073a.htm">veracity</a> and fidelity. It is on this ground alone that we can speak of Divine <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> at all, and apply the principle: <em>Do ut des</em> (cf. <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, Serm. clviii, c. ii, in P.L., XXXVIII, 863).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>(b) There remains the distinction between merit and satisfaction; for a meritorious work is not identical, either in concept or in fact, with a satisfactory work. In the language of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, satisfaction means:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>atoning by some suitable service for an injury done to another's <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> or for any other offence, in somewhat the same fashion as in modern <a href="05184b.htm">duelling</a> outraged <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> is satisfied by recourse to swords or pistols;</li><li>paying off the temporal punishment due to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> by salutary penitential works <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> undertaken after one's <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> have been forgiven.</li></ul></div>

<p>Sin, as an offence against <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, demands satisfaction in the first sense; the temporal punishment due to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> calls for satisfaction in the second sense (see PENANCE).</p>

<p><a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> teaches us that the <a href="08374c.htm">Incarnate Son of God</a> by His death on the cross has in our stead fully satisfied <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a> at our <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, and thereby effected a reconciliation between the world and its Creator. Not, however, as though nothing were now left to be done by man, or as though he were now restored to the state of original innocence, whether he wills it or not; on the contrary, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ demand of him that he make the fruits of the Sacrifice of the Cross his own by personal exertion and co-operation with grace, by justifying <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and the reception of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. It is a defined article of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> that man before, in, and after justification derives his whole capability of meriting and satisfying, as well as his actual merits and satisfactions, solely from the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> treasure of merits which Christ gained for us on the Cross (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. VI, cap. xvi; Sess. XIV, cap. viii).</p>

<p>The second kind of satisfaction, that namely by which temporal punishment is removed, consists in this, that the penitent after his justification gradually cancels the temporal punishments due to his <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, either <em>ex opere operato</em>, by conscientiously performing the penance imposed on him by his confessor, or <em>ex opere operantis</em>, by self-imposed penances (such as <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, etc.) and by bearing patiently the sufferings and trials sent by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; if he neglects this, he will have to give full satisfaction (<em>satispassio</em>) in the pains of <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a> (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. XIV, can. xiii, in <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 923). Now, if the concept of satisfaction in its twofold meaning be compared with that of merit as developed above, the first general conclusion will be that merit constitutes a debtor who owes a reward, whilst satisfaction supposes a creditor whose demands must be met. In <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> work of <a href="12677d.htm">redemption</a> merit and satisfaction materially coincide almost to their full extent, since as a matter of fact the merits of Christ are also works of satisfaction for man. But, since by His <a href="11527b.htm">Passion</a> and Death He truly merited, not only <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> for us, but also external glory for His own Person (His glorious <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and <a href="01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, His sitting at the right hand of the Father, the glorification of His name of Jesus, etc.), it follows that His personal merit extends further than His satisfaction, as He had no need of satisfying for Himself. The substantial and conceptual distinction between merit and satisfaction holds good when applied to the justified <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, for every meritorious act has for its main object the increase of grace and of eternal glory, while satisfactory works have for their object the removal of the temporal punishment still due to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. In practice and generally speaking, however, merit and satisfaction are found in every salutary act, so that every meritorious work is also satisfactory and vice versa. It is indeed also essential to the concept of a satisfactory work of penance that it be penal and difficult, which qualities are not connoted by the concept of merit; but since, in the present state of fallen nature, there neither is nor can be a meritorious work which in one way or another has not connected with it difficulties and hardships, <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> unanimously teach that all our meritorious works without exception bear a penal character and thereby may become automatically works of satisfaction. Against how many difficulties and distractions have we not to contend even during our <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, which by right should be the easiest of all <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>! Thus, <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> also becomes a penance, and hence confessors may in most cases content themselves with imposing <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> as a penance. (Cf. <a href="09418b.htm">De Lugo</a>, "De p&oelig;nitentia," disp. xxiv, sect. 3.)</p>

<p>(c) Owing to the peculiar relation between and material identity of merit and satisfaction in the present economy of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, a twofold value must in general be distinguished in every good work: the meritorious and the satisfactory value. But each preserves its distinctive character, theoretically by the difference in concepts, and practically in this, that the value of merit as such, consisting in the increase of grace and of heavenly glory, is purely personal and is not applicable to others, while the satisfactory value may be detached from the meriting agent and applied to others. The possibility of this transfer rests on the fact that the residual punishments for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> are in the nature of a <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>, which may be legitimately paid to the creditor and thereby cancelled not only by the debtor himself but also by a friend of the debtor. This consideration is important for the proper understanding of the usefulness of suffrages for the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a> (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. XXV, Decret. de purgat., in <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 983). When one wishes to aid the suffering <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, one cannot apply to them the purely meritorious quality of his work, because the increase of grace and glory accrues only to the agent who merits. But it has pleased the Divine wisdom and mercy to accept the satisfactory quality of one's work under certain circumstances as an equivalent of the temporal punishment still to be endured by the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed, just as if the latter had themselves performed the work. This is one of the most beautiful and consoling aspects of that grand social organization which we call the <a href="04171a.htm">"Communion of Saints"</a>, and moreover affords us an insight into the nature of the <a href="07292b.htm">"heroic act of charity"</a> approved by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, whereby the faithful on earth, out of heroic charity for the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> renounce in their favour the satisfactory fruits of all their <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, even all the suffrages which shall be offered for them after their death, in order that they may thus benefit and assist the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a> more quickly and more efficaciously.</p>

<p>The efficacy of the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the just be it for the living or for the dead, calls for special consideration. In the first place it is evident that <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> as a pre-eminently good work has in common with other similar <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, such as <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, the twofold value of merit and satisfaction. Because of its satisfactory character, <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> will also obtain for the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a> by way of suffrage (<em>per modum suffragii</em>) either a diminution or a total cancelling of the penalty that remains to be paid. <a href="12345b.htm">Prayer</a> has, moreover, the characteristic effect of impetration (<em>effectus impetratorius</em>), for he who <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a> appeals solely to the <a href="06636b.htm">goodness</a>, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, and liberality of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for the fulfilment of his desires, without throwing the weight of his own merits into the scale. He who <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a> fervently and unceasingly gains a hearing with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> because he <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a>, even should he <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> with empty hands (cf. <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs13">John 14:13 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs23">16:23</a>). Thus the special efficacy of <a href="04653a.htm">prayer for the dead</a> is easily explained, since it combines efficacy of satisfaction and impetration, and this twofold efficacy is enhanced by the personal worthiness of the one who, as a friend of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, offers the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Since the meritoriousness of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> supposes the state of justification, or, what amounts to the same, the possession of <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> merit is only an effect or fruit of the state of grace (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. VI, cap. xvi). Hence, it is plain that this whole article is really only a continuation and a completion of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> (see <a href="06689a.htm">GRACE</a>).</p>

<h2 id="section2">The existence of merit</h2>

<p>(a) According to <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> justification consists essentially in the mere covering of man's <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, which remain in the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, and in the external imputation of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>; hence his assertion that even "the just <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> in every good work" (see <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 771), as also that "every work of the just is worthy of damnation [<em>damnabile</em>] and a mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> [<em>peccatum mortale</em>], if it be considered as it really is in the judgment of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" (see M&ouml;hler, "Symbolik", 22). According to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a> (Instit., III, ii, 4) <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> are "impurities and defilement" (<em>inquinamenta et sordes</em>), but <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> covers their innate hideousness with the cloak of the merits of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and imputes them to the <a href="12378a.htm">predestined</a> as <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> in order that He may requite them not with life eternal, but at most with a temporal reward. In consequence of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> proclamation of "evangelical liberty", John Agricola (died 1566) asserted that in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> it was not allowed to preach the "Law", and Nicholas Amsdorf (died 1565) maintained that <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> were positively harmful. Such exaggerations gave rise in 1527 to the fierce <a href="01564b.htm">Antinomian</a> controversy, which, after various efforts on <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> part, was finally settled in 1540 by the recantation forced from Agricola by Joachim II of Brandenburg. Although the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of modern <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> continues obscure and indefinite, it teaches generally speaking that <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> are a spontaneous consequence of justifying <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, without being of any avail for life eternal. Apart from earlier dogmatic declarations given in the Second Synod of Orange of 529 and in the <a href="09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> of 1215 (see <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 191, 430), the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> upheld the traditional <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of merit by insisting that life everlasting is both a grace and a reward (Sess. VI, cap. xvi, in <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 809). It condemned as <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the sinfulness of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> (Sess. VI, can. xxv), and declared as a <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> that the just, in return for their <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> done in <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> through the merits of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, should expect an eternal reward (loc. cit., can. xxvi).</p>

<p>This <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> simply echoes <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="15006b.htm">Tradition</a>. The <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> already declares the meritoriousness of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> before <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. "But the just shall live for evermore: and their reward is with the Lord" (<a href="../bible/wis005.htm#vrs16">Wisdom 5:16</a>). "Be not afraid to be justified even to death: for the reward of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> continueth for ever" (Ecclus., xviii, 22). <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself adds a special reward to each of the Eight Beatitudes and he ends with this fundamental thought: "Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs12">Matthew 5:12</a>) In His description of the Last Judgment, He makes the possession of <a href="07170a.htm">eternal bliss</a> depend on the practice of the corporal works of mercy (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs34">Matthew 25:34 sqq.</a>). Although <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> insists on nothing more strongly than the absolute gratuitousness of <a href="06689a.htm">Christian grace</a>, still he acknowledges merits founded on grace and also the reward due to them on the part of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, which he variously calls "prize" (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs14">Philippians 3:14</a>; <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs24">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>) "reward" (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#vrs24">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>), "crown of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>" (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs7">2 Timothy 4:7 sq.</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#vrs12">James 1:12</a>). It is worthy of note that, in these and many others <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> are not represented as mere adjuncts of justifying <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, but as real fruits of justification and part causes of our eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. And the greater the merit, the greater will be the reward in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs27">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>; <a href="../bible/2co009.htm#vrs6">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>). Thus the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> itself refutes the assertion that "the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of merit is originally foreign to the Gospel" (" Realencyklop&auml;die f&uuml;r protest. Theologie," XX, 3rd ed. Leipzig, 1908, p. 501). That <a href="06689a.htm">Christian grace</a> can be merited either by the observance of the Jewish law or by mere natural works (see <a href="06689a.htm">GRACE</a>) this alone is foreign to the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. On the other hand, eternal reward is promised in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> to those <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> works which are performed in the state of grace, and that because they are meritorious (cf. <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs34">Matthew 25:34 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs6">Romans 2:6 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).</p>

<p>Even <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> concede that, in the oldest literature of the <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="01618a.htm">Apologists</a>, "the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of merit was read into the Gospel," and that <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> by defending "merit in the strict sense gave the key-note to Western <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>" (Realencykl., pp. 501, 502). He was followed by <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> with the declaration: "You can attain to the <a href="02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, if you deserve it by your life and works" ("De op. et elemos.", xiv, ed. Hartel, I, 384). With <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (De offic., I, xv, 57) and <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (De morib. eccl., I, xxv), the other <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> took the <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on merit as a guide in their teaching, especially in their <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> to the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, so that uninterrupted agreement is secured between Bible and Tradition, between patristic and scholastic teaching, between the past and the present. If therefore "the reformation was mainly a struggle against the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of merit" (Realencyklop&auml;die, loc. cit., p. 506) this only proves that the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> defended against unjustified innovations the old <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the meritoriousness of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, founded alike on <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="15006b.htm">Tradition</a>.</p>

<p>(b) This <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, moreover, fully accords with natural ethics. <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, as the supreme lawgiver, owes it to itself to give efficacious sanction to both the natural and the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> law with their many commandments and prohibitions, and to secure their observance by holding out rewards and punishments. Even human <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> are provided with sanctions, which are often very severe. He who denies the meritoriousness of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> performed by the just must necessarily also deny the culpability and demerit of the sinner's misdeeds; must hold that <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> remain without punishment, and that the fear of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> is both groundless and useless. If there be no eternal reward for an upright life and no eternal chastisement for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, it will matter little to the majority of people whether they lead a good or a bad life. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that, even if there were neither reward nor punishment, it would be contrary to rational nature to lead an immoral life; for the moral <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to do always what is right, does not of itself depend on retribution. But <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> undoubtedly went too far when he repudiated as immoral those actions which are performed with a view to our personal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> or to that of others, and proclaimed the <a href="03432a.htm">"categorical imperative"</a>, i.e., frigid <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> clearly perceived, as the only motive of moral conduct. For, though this so-called "autonomy of the moral will" may at first sight appear highly ideal, still it is unnatural and cannot be carried out in practical life, because virtue and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> and merit (with the claim to reward), are not mutually exclusive, but, as correlatives, they rather condition and complete each other. The peace of a good <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> that follows the faithful performance of <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> is an unsought-for reward of our action and an interior <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of which no calamity can deprive us, so that, as a matter of fact, <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> are always linked together.</p>

<p>(c) But is not this continual acting "with one eye on heaven", with which Professor Jodl reproaches <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> moral teaching, the meanest "mercenary spirit" and <a href="02148b.htm">greed</a> which necessarily vitiates to the core all moral action? Can there be any question of morality, if it is only the desire for <a href="07170a.htm">eternal bliss</a> or simply the fear of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> that determines one to do good and avoid <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>? Such a disposition is certainly far from being the ideal of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> morality. On the Contrary, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> proclaims to all her children that pure <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is the first and supreme commandment (cf. <a href="../bible/mar012.htm#vrs30">Mark 12:30</a>). It is our highest ideal to act out of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. For he who truly loves <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> would keep His commandments, even though there were no eternal reward in the next life. Nevertheless, the desire for <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> is a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> and natural consequence of the perfect <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; for <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> is only the perfect possession of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. As a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> friend desires to see his friend without thereby sinking into egotism so does the loving <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> ardently desire the <a href="02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a>, not from a craving for reward, but out of pure <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. It is unfortunately too <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that only the best type of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and especially the great <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, reach this high standard of morality in everyday life. The great majority of ordinary <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> must be deterred from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> principally by the fear of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> and spurred on to <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> by the thought of an eternal reward, before they attain perfect <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. But, even for those <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> who <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, there are times of grave temptation when only the thought of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> and <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> keeps them from falling. Such a disposition, be it habitual or only transitory, is morally less perfect, but it is not immoral. As, according to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and that of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (see above), it is legitimate to hope for a heavenly reward, so, according to the same <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs28">Matthew 10:28</a>), the fear of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> is a motive of moral action, a "grace of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and an impulse of the Holy Ghost" (Council of Trent, Sess. XIV, cap. iv, in <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 898). Only that desire for remuneration (<em>amor mercenarius</em>) is reprehensible which would content itself with an eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> without <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and that "doubly servile fear" (<em>timor serviliter servilis</em>) is alone immoral which proceeds from a mere dread of punishment without at the same time fearing <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. But the dogmatic as well as the moral teaching of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> avoids both of these extremes (see <a href="02065a.htm">ATTRITION</a>).</p>

<p>Besides blaming the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> for fostering a "craving for reward," <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> also accuse her of teaching "justification by works". External works alone, they allege, such as <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, the recitation of the <a href="13184b.htm">rosary</a> etc., make the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> good and holy, the intention and disposition being held to no account. "The whole <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of merit, especially as explained by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is based on the <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> view which places the essence of morality in the individual action without any regard for the interior disposition as the habitual direction of the personal will" (Realencyklop&auml;die, loc. cit., p. 508). Only the grossest <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> can prompt such remarks. In accord with the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches that the external work has a moral value only when and in so far as it proceeds from a right interior disposition and intention (cf. <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs1">Matthew 6:1 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/mar012.htm#vrs41">Mark 12:41 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs31">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>, etc.). As the body receives its life from the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, so must external actions be penetrated and vivified by <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of intention. In a beautiful play on words <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> says (Serm. iii, n. xi): <em>Bonos mores faciunt boni amores</em>. Hence the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> urges her children to forming each morning the "good intention", that they may thereby sanctify the whole day and make even the indifferent actions of their exterior life serve for the glory of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; "all for the greater <a href="06585a.htm">glory</a> of God", is the constant <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the faithful <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Not only does the moral teaching of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> attribute no moral value whatever to the mere external performance of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> without a corresponding good intention, but it detests such performance as hypocrisy and pretence. On the other hand, our good Intention, provided it be genuine and deep-rooted, naturally spurs us on to external works, and without these works it would be reduced to a mere semblance of life.</p>

<p>A third charge against the <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on merit is summed up in the word "self-righteousness", as if the just man utterly disregarded the merits of Christ and arrogated to himself the whole credit of his <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>. If any <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> has ever been so <a href="11789b.htm">pharisaical</a> as to hold and practise this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, he has certainly set himself in direct opposition to what the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has always proclaimed what <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> expresses in the words: "Non Deus coronat merita tua tanquam merita tua, sed tanquam dona sua" (De grat. et lib. arbitrio, xv), i.e., <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> crowns thy merits, not as thine earnings, but as His gifts. Nothing was more strong and frequently inculcated by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> than the proposition that the faithful owe their entire capability of meriting and all their <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> solely to the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> merits of the Redeemer <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. It is indeed clear that meritorious works, as "fruits of the justification", cannot be anything but merits due to grace, and not merits due to nature (cf. Council of Trent, Sess. VI, cap. xvi). The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> certainly must rely on the merits of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and, far from boasting of his own self-righteousness, he must acknowledge in all <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> that even his merits, acquired with the help of grace, are full of imperfections, and that his justification is uncertain (see <a href="06689a.htm">GRACE</a>). Of the satisfactory works of penance the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> makes this explicit declaration: "Thus, man has not wherein to glory, but all our glorying is in Christ, in whom we live, move, and make satisfaction, bringing forth fruits worthy of penance, which from Him have their efficacy, are by Him offered to the Father, and through Him find with the Father acceptance" (Sess. XIV, cap. viii, in <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 904). Does this read like self-righteousness?</p>

<h2 id="section3">Conditions of merit</h2>

<p>For all <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> merit (<em>vere mereri</em>; Council of Trent, Sess. VI, can. xxxii), by which is to be understood only <em>meritum de condigno</em> (see Pallavicini, "Hist. Concil. Trident.", VIII, iv), <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> have set down seven conditions, of which four regard the meritorious work, two the agent who merits, and one <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> who rewards.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>(a) In order to be meritorious a work must be morally good, morally free, done with the assistance of <a href="06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, and inspired by a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> motive. As every <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> deed implies demerit and deserves punishment, so the very notion of merit supposes a morally good work. <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> teaches that "whatsoever <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> thing [<em>bonum</em>] any man shall do, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond, or free" (Eph. vi, 8). Not only are more perfect works of supererogation, such as the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of perpetual chastity, good and meritorious but also works of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, such as the faithful observance of the commandments. <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself actually made the attainment of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> depend on the mere observance of the ten commandments when he answered the youth who was anxious about his <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>: "If thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments" (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs17">Matthew 19:17</a>). According to the authentic declaration of the <a href="09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215) the married state is also meritorious for <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>: "Not only those who live in virginity and continence, but also those who are married, please <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> and merit eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>" (cap. Firmiter, in <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 430). As to morally indifferent actions (e.g., exercise and play, recreation derived from reading and music), some <a href="14601a.htm">moralists</a> hold with the <a href="13610b.htm">Scotists</a> that such works may be indifferent not only in the abstract but also practically; this opinion, however is rejected by the majority of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Those who hold this view must hold that such morally indifferent actions are neither meritorious nor demeritorious, but become meritorious in proportion as they are made morally good by means of the "good intention". Although the <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> omission of a work of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, such as the hearing of Mass on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, is <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a> and thereby demeritorious, still, according to the opinion of Francisco Su&aacute;rez (De gratia, X, ii, 5 sqq.), it is more than <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether conversely the mere omission of a bad action is in itself meritorious. But the overcoming of a temptation would be meritorious, since this struggle is a positive act and not a mere omission. Since the external work as such derives its entire moral value from the interior disposition, it adds no increase of merit except in so far as it reacts on the will and has the effect of intensifying and sustaining its action (cf. <a href="09418b.htm">De Lugo</a>, "De p&oelig;nit.", disp. xxiv, sect. 6).</p>

<p>As to the second requisite, i.e., moral liberty, it is clear from ethics that actions, due to external force or internal compulsion, can deserve neither reward nor punishment. It is an axiom of criminal <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> that no one shall be punished for a misdeed done without <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>; similarly, a good work can only then be meritorious and deserving of reward when it proceeds from a free determination of the will. This is the teaching of Christ (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs21">Matthew 19:21</a>): "If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give it to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and thou shalt have treasure in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>."</p>

<p>The necessity of the third condition, i.e., of the influence of <a href="06689x.htm">actual grace</a>, is clear from the fact that every act meriting <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> must evidently be <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> just as <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> itself is <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and that consequently it cannot be performed without the help of prevenient and assisting grace, which is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> even for the just. The strictly <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> destiny of the <a href="02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a>, for which the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> must strive, necessitates ways and means which lie altogether beyond what is purely natural (see <a href="06689a.htm">GRACE</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> motive is required because <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> must be <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, not only as regards their object and circumstances, but also as regards the end for which they are performed (<em>ex fine</em>). But, in assigning the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> qualities of this motive, <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> differ widely. While some require the motive of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>motivum fidei</em>) in order to have merit, others demand in addition the motive of charity (<em>motivum caritatis</em>), and thus, by rendering the conditions more difficult, considerably restrict the extent of meritorious works (as distinguished from merely <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>). Others again set down as the only condition of merit that the good work of the just man, who already has habitual <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and charity, be in conformity with the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, and require no other special motive. This last opinion, which is in accordance with the practice of the majority of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, is tenable, provided <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and charity exert at least an habitual (not necessarily virtual or actual) influence upon the good work, which influence essentially consists in this, that man at the time of his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> makes an act of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, thereby knowingly and willingly beginning his <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> journey towards <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>; this intention habitually retains its influence as long as it has not been revoked by mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. And, since there is a grave <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to make acts of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity from time to time, these two motives will thereby be occasionally renewed and revived. For the controversy regarding the motive of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> see Chr. Pesch, "Pr&aelig;lect. dogmat.", V, 3rd ed. (1908), 225 sqq.; on the motive of charity, see Pohle, "Dogmatik" II 4th ed. (1909), 565 sqq.</p>

<p>(b) The agent who merits must fulfil two conditions: He must be in the state of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> (<em>status vi&oelig;</em>) and in the state of grace (<em>status grati&oelig;</em>). By the state of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> is to be understood our earthly life; death as a natural (although not an essentially <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>) limit, closes the time of meriting. The time of sowing is confined to this life; the reaping is reserved for the next, when no man will be able to sow either wheat or cockle. Comparing the earthly life with day and the time after death with night, Christ says: "The night cometh, when no man can work [<em>operari</em>]" (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#vrs4">John 9:4</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/ecc011.htm#vrs3">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a>; <a href="../bible/sir014.htm#vrs17">Sirach 14:17</a>). The opinion proposed by a few <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> (Hirscher, Schell), that for certain classes of men there may still be a possibility of conversion after death, is contrary to the <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> that the particular judgment (<em>judicium particulare</em>) determines instantly and definitively whether the future is to be one of eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> or of eternal misery (cf. <a href="08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a>, "Theologie der Vorzeit", II, 2nd ed., M&uuml;nster, 1872, pp. 427 sqq.). Baptized children, who die before attaining the age of reason, are admitted to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> without merits on the sole title of inheritance (<em>titulus h&oelig;reditatis</em>); in the case of adults, however, there is the additional title of reward (<em>titulus mercedis</em>), and for that reason they will enjoy a greater measure of eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the state of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, the state of grace (i.e., the possession of <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>) is required for meriting, because only the just can be "sons of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" and "heirs of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (cf. <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs17">Romans 8:17</a>). In the <a href="11460a.htm">parable</a> of the vine Christ expressly declares the "abiding in him" a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition for "bearing fruit": "He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit" (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs5">John 15:5</a>); and this constant union with Christ is effected only by <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. In opposition to Vasquez, most <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> are of opinion that one who is holier will gain greater merit for a given work than one who is less holy, although the latter perform the same work under exactly the same circumstances and in the same way. The reason is that a higher degree of grace enhances the godlike dignity of the agent, and this dignity increases the value of the merit. This explains why <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, in consideration of the greater <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of some <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> specially dear to Him, has deigned to grant favours which otherwise He would have refused (<a href="../bible/job042.htm#vrs8">Job 42:8</a>; <a href="../bible/dan003.htm#vrs35">Daniel 3:35</a>).</p>

<p>(c) Merit requires on the part of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> that He accept (<em>in actu secundo</em>) the good work as meritorious, even though the work in itself (<em>in actu primo</em>) and previous to its acceptance by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, be already truly meritorious. <a href="14580a.htm">Theologians</a>, however, are not agreed as to the necessity of this condition. The <a href="13610b.htm">Scotists</a> hold that the entire condignity of the good work rests exclusively on the gratuitous promise of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and His free acceptance, without which even the most heroic act is devoid of merit, and with which even mere naturally <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> may become meritorious. Other <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> with Francisco Su&aacute;rez (De gratia, XIII, 30) maintain that, before and without Divine acceptance, the strict equality that exists between merit and reward founds a claim of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> to have the <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> rewarded in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Both these views are extreme. The <a href="13610b.htm">Scotists</a> almost completely lose sight of the godlike dignity which belongs to the just as "adopted children of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>", and which naturally impresses on their <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> actions the character of meritoriousness; Francisco Su&aacute;rez, on the other hand, unnecessarily exaggerates the notion of Divine <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and the condignity of merit, for the abyss that lies between human service and Divine remuneration is ever so wide that there could be no <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of bridging it over by a gratuitous promise of reward and the subsequent acceptance on the part of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> who has bound himself by His own fidelity. Hence we prefer with <a href="09192a.htm">Lessius</a> (De perfect. moribusque div., XIII, ii) and <a href="09418b.htm">De Lugo</a> (De incarnat. disp. 3, sect. 1 sq.) to follow a middle course. We therefore say that the condignity between merit and reward owes its origin to a twofold source: to the intrinsic value of the good work and to the free acceptance and gratuitous promise of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/jam001.htm#vrs12">James 1:12</a>). See Schiffini, "De gratia divina" (Freiburg, 1901), pp. 416 sqq.</p>

<h2 id="section4">The objects of merit</h2>

<p>Merit in the strict sense (<em>meritum de condigno</em>) gives a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to a threefold reward: increase of <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, heavenly glory, and the increase thereof; other <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> can be acquired only in virtue of congruous merit (<em>meritum de conqruo</em>).</p>

<p>(a) In its Sixth Session (can. xxxii), the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declared: "If any one saith . . . that the justified man by <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> . . . does not truly merit [<em>vere mereri</em>] increase of grace eternal life, and the attainment of that eternal life &mdash; if so be, however, that he depart in grace &mdash; and also an increase in glory; let him be <a href="01455e.htm">anathema</a>." The expression "vere mereri" shows that the three objects mentioned above can be merited in the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> and strict sense of the word, viz., <em>de condigno</em>. Increase of grace (<em>augmentum grati&oelig;</em>) is named in the first place to exclude the first grace of justification concerning which the council had already taught: "None of those things, which precede justification &mdash; whether <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> or works &mdash; merit the grace itself of justification" (Sess. VI, cap. viii). This impossibility of meriting the first habitual grace is as much a <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of our Faith as the absolute impossibility of meriting the first <a href="06689x.htm">actual grace</a> (see <a href="06689a.htm">GRACE</a>). The growth in <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, on the other hand, is perfectly evident from both <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="15006b.htm">Tradition</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/sir018.htm#vrs22">Sirach 18:22</a>; <a href="../bible/2co009.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="../bible/rev022.htm#vrs11">Revelation 22:11 sq.</a>). To the question whether the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="06689x.htm">actual graces</a> needed by the just be also an object of strict merit, <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> commonly answer that, together with the increase of habitual grace, merely sufficient <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> may be merited <em>de condigno</em>, but not efficacious <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a>. The reason is that the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to efficacious <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> would necessarily include the strict right to <a href="11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>, which lies completely outside the sphere of condign merit although it may be obtained by <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (see <a href="06689a.htm">GRACE</a>). Not even heroic acts give a strict right to <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> which are always efficacious or to <a href="11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>, for even the greatest saint is still <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to watch, <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a>, and tremble lest he fall from the state of grace. This explains why the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> purposely omitted efficacious grace and the gift of perseverance, when it enumerated the objects of merit.</p>

<p>Life everlasting (<em>vita &oelig;terna</em>) is the second object of merit; the dogmatical <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> for this assertion has been given above in treating of the existence of merit. It still remains to inquire whether the distinction made by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> between <em>vita &oelig;terna</em> and <em>vit&oelig; &oelig;tern&oelig; consecutio</em> is meant to signify a twofold reward: "life everlasting" and "the attainment of life everlasting", and hence a twofold object of merit. But <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> rightly deny that the council had this in view, because it is clear that the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to a reward coincides with the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to the payment of the same. Nevertheless, the distinction was not useless or superfluous because, notwithstanding the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to eternal glory, the actual possession of it must necessarily be put off until death, and even then depends upon the condition: "si tamen in gratin decesserit" (provided he depart in grace). With this last condition the council wished also to inculcate the salutary <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> that <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> may be lost by mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that the loss of the state of grace <em>ipso facto</em> entails the forfeiture of all merits however great. Even the greatest saint, should he die in the state of mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, arrives in <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> as an enemy of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> with empty hands, just as if during life he had never done anything, meritorious. All his former <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> to grace and glory are cancelled. To make them revive a new justification is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. On this "revival of merits" (<em>reviviscentia meritorum</em>) see Schiffini, "De gratia divina" (Freiburg, 1901), pp. 661 sqq.; this question is treated in detail by Pohle, "Dogmatik", III (4th ed., Paderborn, 1910), pp. 440 sqq.</p>

<p>As the third object of merit the council mentions the "increase of glory" (<em>glori&oelig; augmentum</em>) which evidently must correspond to the increase of grace, as this corresponds to the accumulation of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>. At the Last Day, when Christ will come with his <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> to judge the world, "He will render to every man according to his works [<em>secundum opera eius</em>]" (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs27">Matthew 16:27</a>; cf <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs6">Romans 2:6</a>). And <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> repeats the same (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>): "Every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour [<em>secundum suum laborem</em>]". This explains the inequality that exists between the glory of the different <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<p>(b) By his <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> the just man may merit for himself many <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> and favours, not, however, by right and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> (<em>de condigno</em>), but only congruously (<em>de congruo</em>). Most <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> incline to the opinion that the grace of <a href="11711a.htm">final perseverance</a> is among the objects of congruous merit, which grace, as has been shown above, is not and cannot be merited condignly. It is better, however, and safer if, with a view to obtaining this great grace on which our eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> depends, we have recourse to fervent and unremitting <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, for Christ held out to us that above all our spiritual needs he would infallibly hear our <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> for this great gift (cf. <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs22">Matthew 21:22</a>; <a href="../bible/mar011.htm#vrs24">Mark 11:24</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs9">Luke 11:9</a>; <a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs13">John 14:13</a>, etc.). For further explanation see <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, "De justif.", V, xxii; Tepe, "Instit. theol.", III (Paris, 1896), 258 sqq.</p>

<p>It is impossible to answer with equal <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> the question whether the just man is able to merit in advance the grace of conversion, if perchance he should happen to fall into mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> denies this absolutely: "Nullus potest sibi mereri reparationem post lapsum futurum neque merito condigni neque merito congrui" (Summa Theol., I-II, Q. cxiv, a. 7). But because the Prophet Jehu declared to Josaphat, the wicked King of Juda (cf. <a href="../bible/2ch019.htm#vrs2">2 Chronicles 19:2 sqq.</a>), that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> had regard for his former merits, almost all other <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> consider it a "pious and probable opinion" that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, in granting the grace of conversion does not entirely disregard the merits lost by mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, especially if the merits previously acquired surpass in number and weight the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, which, perhaps, were due to weakness, and if those merits are not crushed, as it were, by a burden of iniquity (cf. Francisco Su&aacute;rez, "De gratia", XII, 38). <a href="12345b.htm">Prayer</a> for future conversion from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is indeed morally good and useful (cf. <a href="../bible/psa070.htm#vrs9">Psalm 70:9</a>), because the disposition by which we sincerely wish to be freed as soon as possible from the state of enmity with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> cannot but be pleasing to Him. Temporal <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a>, such as health, freedom from extreme poverty, success in one's undertakings, seem to be objects of congruous merit only in so far as they are conducive to <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for only on this hypothesis do they assume the character of <a href="06689x.htm">actual graces</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs33">Matthew 6:33</a>). But, for obtaining temporal favours, <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> is more effective than meritorious works, provided that the granting of the petition be not against the designs of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> or the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> welfare of him who <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a> . The just man may merit <em>de congruo</em> for others (e.g., <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, relatives, and friends) whatever he is able to merit for himself: the grace of conversion, <a href="11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>, temporal <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a>, nay even the very first prevenient grace (<em>gratia prima pr&oelig;veniens</em>), (Summa Theol., I-II, Q. cxiv, a. 6) which he can in no wise merit for himself. St. Thomas gives as reason for this the intimate bond of friendship which <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> establishes between the just man and <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. These effects are immeasurably strengthened by <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> for others; as it is beyond <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> plays an important part in the present economy of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For further explanation see Francisco Su&aacute;rez, "De gratia", XII, 38. Contrary to the opinion of a few <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> (e.g., <a href="02567a.htm">Billuart</a>), we hold that even a man in mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, provided he co-operate with the first grace of conversion, is able to merit <em>de congruo</em> by his <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> acts not only a series of <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> which will lead to conversion, but finally justification itself; at all events it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that he may obtain these <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> by <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, made with the assistance of grace (cf. <a href="../bible/psa050.htm#vrs9">Psalm 50:9</a>; <a href="../bible/tob012.htm#vrs9">Tobit 12:9</a>; <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#vrs24">Daniel 4:24</a>; <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs14">Matthew 6:14</a>).</p>
