<p>A (partly) <a href="04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> held at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, now in the Grand Duchy of Baden, from 5 Nov., 1414, to 22 April, 1418. Its forty-five general sessions were devoted to three chief purposes:</p>

<blockquote><p>(I) The Extinction of the So-Called <a href="13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>; <br>(II) The Reformation of Ecclesiastical Government and Life; <br>(III) The Repression of Heresy. <br>The article will also take up: <br>(IV) Attendance at the Council; General Considerations.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="section1">The extinction of the so-called Western Schism</h2>

<p>In its attempt to restore to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> her immemorial unity of headship the <a href="12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> in 1409 had only added to the confusion and <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> that afflicted all <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> since 1378 (<em>see</em> <a href="13539a.htm">WESTERN SCHISM</a>). There were now three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, the two deposed by the council (<a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> and <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>) and its own creation, <a href="01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>; the latter soon died (3 May, 1410) and was succeeded by Cardinal Baldassare Cossa as <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. Obedient to a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> that ordered a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> every three years, this <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> convoked such an assembly at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for April, 1412, but with so little success that it was prorogued and again convoked for the beginning of 1413; its only important <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> was a condemnation of the writings of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>. In the meantime the treachery and <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> of Ladislaus of Naples made <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> quite dependent politically on the new Emperor-elect Sigismund whose anxiety for a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> on German territory was finally satisfied by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, then an exile from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He convoked it from <a href="09322b.htm">Lodi</a>, 9 December, 1413, for 1 November, 1414, at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, a free city of the empire, on Lake Constance. It was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> opened 5 November in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, where all the public sessions were held. The first public session took place 16 November under the presidency of <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, and for a while it considered itself a continuation of the <a href="12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a>, and <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> the sole legitimate <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. It was soon evident, however, that many members of the new assembly (comparatively few <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, many <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and of canon and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>, procurators of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, deputies of <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters, provosts, etc., agents and representatives of princes, etc.) favoured strongly the <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> abdication of all three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. This was also the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of Emperor Sigismund (q. v;) present since <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a>, 1414, and destined to exercise a profound and continuous influence on the course of the council in his character of imperial protector of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; The French deputies especially urged this solution of the intolerable crisis, under the leadership of Pierre d'Ailly (<a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>), Guillaume Fillastre (<a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of San Marco), and <a href="06530c.htm">Jean Charlier de Gerson</a>, chancellor of the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, representative of the French king, and known with d'Ailly, as "the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of the council". The <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had accompanied <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> in large numbers and stood for his legitimacy were soon rendered helpless by new methods of discussion and voting. Early in January, 1415, envoys of <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> appeared, but only to propose a personal meeting at <a href="11048a.htm">Nice</a> of their <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor. Towards the end of the month <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> (Angelo Corrario) offered, through his representatives, to resign, on condition that the other <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> did the same. The execution of this project, henceforth the main object of the council, was long delayed for reasons that will appear below. Pressure was at once brought to bear on <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> by Emperor Sigismund and by the non-Italian members. His resistance was finally broken by the resolution of the members to vote by "nations" and not by <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. The legality of this measure, an imitation of the "nations" of the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, was more than questionable, but during February, 1415, it was carried through and thenceforth accepted in practice, though never authorized by any formal <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the council (Finke, Forschungen, 31-33) and opposed by d'Ailly and Fillastre, who wanted, indeed, a considerable enlargement of the voting body, by the inclusion of professors (doctors) of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, etc., but not the abandonment of the traditional individual vote; the former was willing to compromise on a vote according to ecclesiastical provinces. The vote by nations was in great measure the work of the English, German, and French members, but the <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a> did not long resist, and on this basis the council's work was organized and executed as follows: By each of the four nations represented at the council, i.e. Germans (with whom were counted the few Poles, <a href="07547a.htm">Hungarians</a>, Danes, and Scandinavians), English, French, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a>, several deputies, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and lay, were appointed to represent the entire membership of the nation present at Constance. These national deputies met separately under a president of their own choice, but changed from month to month. Their decisions were reached by a majority vote, and were then communicated to the General Congregation of all four nations in which the vote of a majority (three) was decisive; There seems also to have been (Finke, Forschungen, 36-37) an important general committee appointed by the nations to prepare the subjects of discussion for the individual nations, and to act generally as intermediary. At the seventh session (2 May, 1415) the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to vote apart was withdrawn from the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; henceforth they could only vote like other individuai deputies in the meetings of their respective nations. The <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, therefore, was not represented as such, while the small English nation (20 deputies, 3 <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>) was equal in influence to the entire Italian representation, as <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> about one-half the council. The decisions of the general congregations were presented at the public sessions of the council and there <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, unanimously, as <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>While these measures were being taken <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> grew daily more suspicious of the council. Nevertheless, and partly in consequence of a fierce anonymous attack, from an Italian source, on his life and character, he promised under <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> (2 March, 1415) to resign. On 20 March, however, he secretly fled from <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> and took refuge at Schaffhausen on territory of his friend Frederick, Duke of Austria-Tyrol. This step filled the council with consternation, for it threatened both its existence and its authority. Emperor Sigismund, however, held together the wavering assembly. Then followed the public sessions (third to fifth) of 26 and 30 March and 5 April out of which came the famous decrees "Articles of Constance", long a chief argument of Gallicanism. As finally adopted in the fifth session they were five in number and declared that the council, legitimately called in the Holy Spirit, is a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>, represents the whole Church Militant, has its authority directly from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; and that in all that pertains to <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, the extinction of the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> and reformation in head and members, every <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, even the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, is bound to obey it; that in case of refusal to obey the council all recalcitrant <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> (even the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>) are subject to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> punishment and in case of necessity to other (civil) sanctions; that without the consent of the council <a href="08434a.htm">Pope John</a> cannot call away from <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> and its officials, whose absence might compel the closing of the council or hinder its work; that all censures inflicted since his departure by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> on members and supporters of the council are void, and that <a href="08434a.htm">Pope John</a> and the members of the council have hitherto enjoyed full liberty. In the meantime (29 March, 1415) the English, German, and French nations had agreed to four articles, in the first two of which was expressed the complete supremacy of the council over the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; these two were incorporated in the aforesaid articles of the fifth session. It has been maintained that these decrees were meant only for the extraordinary situation which then faced the council; they express, nevertheless, the well-known persuasion of the majority of the peculiar <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> representation at Constance that the council, independently of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, was the final depository of supreme <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; indeed, by virtue of these decrees they proceeded at once to judge and depose <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, hitherto for them the legitimate <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. It is to be noted that of the twelve <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> present at Constance only seven or eight assisted at the fifth session, and they solely to avoid <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> (among the absent was d'Ailly). Nor would any <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> announce these decrees; that office fell to a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Andrew of Posen. The emperor was present at their <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, also 200 members, mostly <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>, etc. These decrees it must be remembered, though adopted at Basle and often quoted by the disciples of Gallicanism and other opponents of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy, were formulated and accepted at Constance amid quite unusual circumstances, in much haste, and in quasi despair at the threatened failure of the long-desired general council; they ran counter to the immemorial praxis of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and substituted for its Divine constitution the will of the multitude or at best a kind of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> parliamentarism. They were never approved by the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> (Funk, Kirchengeschichtliche Studien, <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1897, I, 489-98) and were almost at once implicitly rejected by <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc., XXVIII, 200). The rest of March, and the months of April and May were consumed in a tragic conflict of the council with <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. He did not withdraw his resignation, but posited conditions that the council refused; he called away from Constance several <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and members of the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>, who were soon, however, <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return; put forth a plea of lack of liberty; complained to the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> concerning the method of voting, as well as his treatment by the council and the emperor; and finally fled from Schaffhausen to Lauenburg, giving the council reason to fear either his final escape from imperial reach or the withdrawal of the Italian representatives. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> soon fled again, this time to Freiburg in the Breisgau, and thence to Breisach on the Rhine, but was soon compelled to return to <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, whence eventually (17 May) he was brought by deputies of the council to the vicinity of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and there held <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, while the council proceeded to his trial. He had exhausted all means of resistance, and was morally vanquished. Unwilling to undergo the ordeal of the impending trial he renounced all right of defence and threw himself on the mercy of the council. He was deposed in the twelfth session (29 Mar, 1415), not for <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> but for <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>, abetting of <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, and <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> life, having already been suspended by the council in the tenth session (14 May). Two days later he ratified under <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> the action of the council and was condemned to indefinite <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> in the custody of the emperor. He was held successively in the castles of Gottlieben, Heidelberg, and Mannheim, but was eventually released, for a heavy ransom, with the help of <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, and in 1419 died at Florence as <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Tusculum. (For a fuller treatment of the charges against him, see <a href="08434a.htm">JOHN XXIII</a>.) The promised resignation of <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> was now in order, and was accomplished with the dignity to be expected from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> usually considered by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historians the legitimate occupant of the See of Peter, though at this time his obedience had practically vanished, being confined to <a href="13057c.htm">Rimini</a> and a few German <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Through his protector and plenipotentiary, Carlo Malatesta, Lord of <a href="13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, he posited as conditions that the council should be reconvoked by himself, and that in the session which accepted his resignation neither Baldassare Cossa nor any representative of him should preside. The council agreed to these conditions. The fourteenth session (4 July, 1415) had, therefore, for its president the Emperor Sigismund, whereby it appeared, as the supporters of <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory</a> wished it to appear, that hitherto the council was an assembly convoked by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. The famous <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="08476a.htm">John of Ragusa (Johannes Dominici)</a>, friend and adviser of <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, and since 19 Dec., 1414, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> representative at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, convoked anew the council in the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> name and authorized its future acts. The reunion of both obediences (<a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> and <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>) was then proclaimed, whereupon the <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a> (Viviers) assumed the presidency, and Malatesta pronounced, in the name of <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory</a>, the latter's abdication of all right whatsoever to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory</a> confirmed these acts in the seventeenth session (14 July) and was himself confirmed as <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Porto, Dean of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> and perpetual Legate of <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, in which position he died (18 Oct., 1417) at <a href="12675a.htm">Recanati</a>, in his ninetieth year in the odour of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. From the fourteenth session, in which he convoked the council, it is considered by many with Phillips (Kirchenrecht, I, 256) a legitimate general council.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>There remained now to obtain the resignation of <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (Pedro de Luna). For this purpose, and because he insisted on personal dealings with himself, Emperor Sigismund and deputies of the council went to <a href="11700b.htm">Perpignan</a>, then Spanish territory, to confer with him, but the stubborn old man, despite his pretended willingness to resign, was not to be moved (Sept.-Oct., 1415) from the claims he had so persistently and amid so great vicissitudes defended. Soon, however, he was abandoned by the Rings of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a>, and Navarre, hitherto his chief supporters. By the Treaty of Narbonne (13 Dec., 1415), they bound themselves to co-operate with the Council of Constance for the deposition of Benedict and the election of a new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. St. Vincent Ferrer hitherto the main support of Benedict, and his confessor, now gave him up as a <a href="11696a.htm">perjurer</a>; the council confirmed (4 Feb., 1416) the articles of Narbonne, the immediate execution of which was retarded, among other causes, by the flight of Benedict (13 Nov., 1415) from the fortress of Perpignan to the inaccessible rock of Pe&ntilde;iscola on the sea-coast near <a href="15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, where he died in 1423, maintaining to the end his good right (see <a href="09431c.htm">PEDRO DE LUNA</a>).</p>

<p>Various causes, as just said, held back the appearance of the Spanish deputies at the council. Finally they arrived at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> for the twenty-first session (15 Oct., 1416) and were thenceforth counted as the fifth nation (Fromme, Die spanische Nation und das Konzil von Konstanz, M&uuml;nster, 1896). The next eight months were largely taken up with complicated canonical procedure destined to compel the abdication or justify the deposition of <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, who in the meantime had <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> solemnly his former royal adherents and with a <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> worthy of a better cause maintained that Holy Church, the <a href="01720a.htm">Ark of Noah</a>, was now on the wave-worn peak of Pe&ntilde;iscola, in the little group of a few thousand <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> who yet clung to his shadowy authority, and not at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>. He was finally deposed in the thirty-seventh session (26 July, 1417) as guilty of <a href="11696a.htm">perjury</a>, a <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, and a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>; his private life and <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> character, unlike those of <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, were never assailed. The <a href="13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> was thus at an end, after nearly forty years of disastrous life; one <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>) had <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> abdicated; another (<a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>) had been suspended and then deposed, but had submitted in canonical form; the third claimant (<a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>) was cut off from the body of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, "a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> without a Church, a shepherd without a flock" (Hergenr&ouml;ther-Kirsch). It had come about that, whichever of the three claimants of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> was the legitimate <a href="12260a.htm">successor of Peter</a>, there reigned throughout the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> a universal uncertainty and an intolerable confusion, so that <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and scholars and upright <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> were to be found in all three obediences. On the principle that a <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> is no <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> appeared really vacant, and under the circumstances could not possibly be otherwise filled than by the action of a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>.</p>

<p>The canonical irregularities of the council seem less blameworthy when to this practical vacancy of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> chair we add the universal disgust and weariness at the continuance of the so-called <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, despite all imaginable efforts to restore to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> its unity of headship, the justified fear of new complications, the imminent peril of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and discipline amid the temporary wreckage of the traditional authority of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and the rapid growth of <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> teachings equally ruinous to <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>.</p>

<h3>Election of Martin V</h3>

<p>Under the circumstances the usual form of papal election by the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> alone (<em>see</em> <a href="04192a.htm">CONCLAVE</a>) was impossible, if only for the strongly inimical feeling of the majority of the council, which held them responsible not only for the horrors of the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, but also for many of the administrative abuses of the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> (see below), the immediate correction of which seemed to not a few of no less importance, to say the least, than the election of a pope. This object was not obscured by minor dissensions, e.g. concerning the rightful rank of the Spanish nation, the number of votes of the <a href="03410b.htm">Aragonese</a> and Castilians, respectively, the right of the English to constitute a nation, etc. The French, Spanish, and Italian nations desired an immediate papal election; a Church without a head was a monstrosity, said d'Ailly. Under Bishop Robert of <a href="13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> the English held stoutly for the reforms that seemed imperative in the administration of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>; Emperor Sigismund was foremost among the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> for the same cause, and was ready to take violent measures in its interest. But Robert of <a href="13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> died, and curiously enough, it was by another <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Henry of <a href="15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, then on his way to Palestine, and a near relative of the King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, that the antagonistic measures of papal election and curial reform were reconciled in favour of the priority of the former, but with satisfactory assurance, among other points, that the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> would at once undertake a serious reform of all abuses; that those reforms would be at once proclaimed by the council on which all the nations agreed; and that the manner of the imminent papal election should be left to a special commission. Among the five reform decrees passed at once by the council in its thirty-ninth session (9 Oct., 1417) was the famous "Frequens" which provided for a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> every ten years; the next two, however, were to be convoked by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> after five and seven years respectively, the first of them at Pavia.</p>

<p>In the fortieth session finally (30 Oct.) was discussed the manner of the new papal election. The council decreed that for this occasion to the twenty-three <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> should be added thirty deputies of the council (six from each nation) making a body of fifty-three electors. Another <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of this session provided for the immediate and serious attention of the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to eighteen points concerning <em>reformatio in capite et <a href="13147a.htm">Curia Romana</a></em>. The forty-first session (8 Nov.) provided for the details of the election and for this purpose had the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> (6 Dec., 1351) read. That afternoon the electors assembled in <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> and after three days chose for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the <a href="03333b.htm">Roman Cardinal</a> Odo Colonna, who took the name of <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. He was only a <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and so was successively made <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Fromme, "Die Wahl Martins V.", in "R&ouml;m. Quartalschrift", 1896). His <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> took place 21 November, 1417. At its forty-fifth session he solemnly closed the council (22 April, 1418), whereupon, declining invitations to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> or to some German city, he returned to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and after a short stay in <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, entered <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 28 Sept., 1420, and took up his residence in the Vatican, thereby restoring to the See of Peter its ancient <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and prestige in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Reformation of ecclesiastical government and life</h2>

<p>The long absence of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the fourteenth century, entailing the economical and political ruin of the ancient <a href="14257a.htm">Patrimony of Peter</a>; the many grave abuses directly or indirectly connected with the administration of <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; the general civil disorders of the time (Hundred Years War, Condottieri, etc.), and other causes, had created, long before the Council of Constance, an earnest demand for a reformation of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions. The writings of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists and the utterances of several popular <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> (<a href="02782a.htm">St. Bridget of Sweden</a>, <a href="03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>) are alone enough to show how well justified was this universal demand (Rocquain). In the minds of many members of the council this reformation, as already stated, was of equal importance with the closing of the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>; and to some, especially to the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>, it seemed to overshadow even the need of a head for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was precisely the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, they argued, whose administration most needed reform, and now, when both were weakest and for the first time in their history had felt the mastery of the <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists, seemed to this party the <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> moment to write these reforms into the common ecclesiastical law, whence they could not easily be expunged. Since July, 1415, there had been a reform commission of thirty-five members; a new one of twenty-five members had been appointed after the entry of the Spanish nation in October, 1416. During its long career many memorials were presented to the council concerning every imaginable abuse. In its general congregations and sessions bitter reproaches were often uttered on the same themes. The academic equality of many of the members, the prostrate condition of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> headship, the peculiar freedom of discussion in the "nation" meetings, and other causes made this council a unique forum for the discussion of all points and methods of reformation. More would certainly have been accomplished had the learned men and the <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> preachers been able to reach some degree of unanimity as to the importance and order of the reforms called for, and had there been more general anxiety for personal reformation and less passion in denouncing the past abuses of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> and curial administration. The Germans (Avisamenta nationis germanic&aelig;) and the English were ardent for a reformation of the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, so that a new, holy, and just <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> would find his way made straight before him. The former asserted that for 150 years the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> had ceased to govern with that <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> which for twelve centuries had characterized them. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, they said, had <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> riches too much, and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> had been neglected. These were the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> causes, according to them, of the corruption of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the decay of good studies, the ruin of churches and <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. Reforms had been promised at <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, but what had become of these promises? As a matter of fact, however, the reforms most loudly called for meant the restoration to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their ancient freedom in the collation of <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, also a notable diminution in the various dues and assessments payable to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical properties</a> and revenues of the various nations, which for several reasons had been growing in number and size during the previous century, and were not always unjustified or inequitable. We have already seen that it was much against their will that the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> agreed to a papal election before receiving full satisfaction in the matter of the aforesaid reforms. The day after his <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> appointed a (third) reform commission, but its members showed no more unanimity than their predecessors in the same office. The new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> declared that he was ready to accept any propositions that were unanimously agreed on. Eventually, after much discussion and various suggestions seven points were agreed to in the forty-third session (21 March, 1418). All exemptions granted during the synod were withdrawn, and in the future should be granted with difficulty; unions and incorporations of <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> were likewise to be diminished; the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed to renounce the revenues of vacant <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>; all <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> was forbidden, likewise the custom of dispensing <a href="02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> from the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of taking orders; the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> right to impose <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> on <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and churches was sensibly restricted; <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> must henceforth wear the dress of their order (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Conc., XXVII, 1114-77). Other reforms were left to the initiative of each nation which provided for them by special <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a>, a term said to have been here used for the first time. The German Concordat (including <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and Scandinavia) and that with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, ran for five years; the English Concordat was indefinite (for the details see <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, op. cit., XXVII, 1189 sqq., and H&uuml;bler, Die Konstanzer Reform und die Konkordate von 1418, Leipzig, 1867). The number of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> was fixed at twenty-four, and they were to be taken proportionately from the great nations. Stricter regulation was also agreed on for <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> reservations, annates, commendams, <a href="07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>, etc. Nevertheless, in a <a href="04285a.htm">papal consistory</a> (10 March, 1418), <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> rejected any right of appeal from the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> to a future council, and asserted the supreme authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> as <a href="15403b.htm">Vicar of Jesus Christ</a> on earth in all questions of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> (Nulli fas est a supremo judice, videlicet Apostolic&acirc; sede seu Rom. Pontif. Jesu Christi vicario in terris appellare aut illius judicium in causis fidei, qu&aelig; tamquam majores ad ipsum et sedem Apostolicam deferend&aelig; sunt, declinare, <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Conc., XXVIII, 200). Von Funk has shown (op. cit., 489 sqq.), that the oft-maintained confirmation of the decrees of Constance by <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, in the last session of the council (omnia et singula determinata et decreta in materiis fidei per pr&aelig;sens concilium conciliariter et non aliter nec alio modo) must be understood only of a specific case (Falkenberg, see below), and not of any notable part of, much less of all, the decrees of Constance. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that in the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Inter Cunctas", 22 Feb., 1418, apropos of the <a href="15722a.htm">Wycliffites</a> and <a href="07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, he calls for a formal approval of the decrees of Constance <em>in favorem fidei a salutem animarum</em>, but these words are easily understood of the council's action against the aforesaid <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> and its efforts to restore to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> a certain head. In particular the famous five articles of the fifth session, establishing the supremacy of the council, never received <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation (Hergenr&ouml;ther-Kirsch, II, 862, and Baudrillart, in Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath., II, 1219-23). For a refutation of the Gallican claim that these decrees possess a dogmatic character, see <a href="06351a.htm">GALLICANISM</a>. Nevertheless, the Council of Constance is usually reckoned the Sixteenth General Council; some, as stated above, acknowledge it as such after the fourteenth session (reconvocation by <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>); others again (Salembier) after the thirty-fifth session (adherence of the Spanish nation); Hefele only in the final sessions (forty-second to forty-fifth) under <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. No <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of it was ever meant to confirm its anti-papal acts; thus <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> (22 July, 1446) approved the council, with due reserve of the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, dignity, and supremacy of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> (absque tamen pr&aelig;judicio juris dignitatis et pr&aelig;eminenti&aelig; Sedis Apostolic&aelig;). See <a href="02711e.htm">Bouix</a>, "De papa, ubi et de concilio oecumenico" (Paris, 1869), and Salembier (below), 313-23.</p>

<h2 id="section3">The repression of heresy</h2>

<p>At various times the council dealt with current <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, among them those of <a href="15722a.htm">John Wyclif</a> and <a href="07584b.htm">John Hus</a>.</p>

<h3>Condemnation of forty-five Wycliffite propositions</h3>

<p>In the eighth session it was question of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, whose writings had already been condemned at the Council of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1412-13) under <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. In this session forty-five propositions of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, already condemned by the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Prague, were censured as <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and in a later session another long list of 260 <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>. All his writings were ordered to be burned and his body was condemned to be dug up and cast out of <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> ground (this was not done until 1428 under Bishop Robert Fleming of Lincoln). In 1418 <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, by the aforesaid <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Inter Cunctas", approved the action of the council (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, op. cit., XXVII, 1210 sq.; see WYCLIFFITES).</p>

<h3>Condemnation and execution of John Hus</h3>

<p>Since 1408 <a href="07584b.htm">John Hus</a>, an eloquent preacher of Prague, had openly taught the <a href="15722a.htm">Wycliffite</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>. By his ardent <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms on the basis of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif's</a> teachings, his patriotic insistence on the purity of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and his assertion of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> nationalism, he had gone rapidly to the front as a leader of his nation, then deeply embittered against the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> dominant in the political and academic life of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. Since 1412 he had been banished from Prague, but was only the more dangerous, by his fiery discourse and his writings, among the highly excited <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, who mostly saw in him the flower of their national genius, and were otherwise embittered against a <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> which then offered too many elements of weakness to the attacks of such reformers as <a href="07584b.htm">John Hus</a> and his friend and admirer Jerome (Hieronymus) of Prague. The <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> concerned chiefly the nature of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (only the <a href="12378a.htm">predestined</a>), the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> headship, the <a href="05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> (Scripture and the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of Christ), Communion under both kinds (q.v. also <a href="07585a.htm">HUSSITES</a>), auricular confession (unnecessary), <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a> (dependent among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> on state of grace). More than once (e.g. 1411) <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> had appealed to a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>, and when at the opening of the Council of Constance Emperor Sigismund and <a href="15587b.htm">King Wenceslaus of Bohemia</a> urged him to present himself, he was not unwilling; it was made up, he <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a>, of ardent reformers, and he could hope by his eloquence to convert them to his own intense <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>. He left Prague, 11 October, 1414, in the company of three <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> nobles and assured of a safe-conduct (<em>salvus conductus</em>) from Emperor Sigismund. They entered <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> 3 November, where <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> took up his residence in a private house, and where (5 November) the safe-conduct was delivered to him. The day after his arrival he appeared before <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, who treated him courteously, removed the censures of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>, but forbade him to say <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> or to preach, also to appear at public <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions (his thoroughly <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> and even revolutionary doctrines were long <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a> and, as said above, had already been condemned at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>). He appeared again before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 28 November, declared himself innocent of a single <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, and said he was ready to retract and do penance if convicted of any. He had continued, however, to violate the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> prohibition, said <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> daily and preached to the people present. Consequently he was the same day arrested, by order of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and a little later (6 December) placed in the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>. On complaining of the unsanitary condition of his place of confinement he was transferred to the castle of Gottlieben, and later to the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> (June, 1415). His examination went on during April and May, and was conducted by d'Ailly and Fillastre; in the meantime he carried on an extensive correspondence, wrote various treatises, and replied to the charges of his opponents. His <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> friends protested against the arrest of <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a>, and exhibited the emperor's safe-conduct (but only after the arrest). Sigismund was at first wroth over the arrest, but later (1 Jan., 1415) declared that he would not prevent the council from dealing according to law with <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> accused of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The aforesaid condemnation (4 May) of the forty-five propositions of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> fore-shadowed the fate of <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a>, despite the protests of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> and Poles against his severe incarceration, the <a href="14035b.htm">slanders</a> against <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, the delay of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, secrecy of the proceedings, and the violation of the imperial safe-conduct (Raynaldus, ad an. 1414, no. 10). The public trial took place on 5, 7, and 8 June, 1415; extracts from his works were read, witnesses were heard. He denied some of the teachings attributed to him, defended others, notably opinions of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, declared that no <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> was a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>, etc. He refused all formul&aelig; of submission, again declared himself conscious of no <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, nor, as he said, had any been <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> against him from the Scriptures. He declared that he would not condemn the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor <a href="11696a.htm">perjure</a> himself. His books were burned by order of the council (24 June). New efforts to obtain a retractation <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> fruitless. He was brought for final sentence before the fifteenth session (6 July, 1415), at which the emperor assisted, and on which occasion thirty propositions, taken mostly from the work of <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> "On the Church" (De Ecclesi&acirc;), were read publicly. He refused to retract anything and so was condemned as a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>, deposed, and degraded, and handed over to the secular arm, which in turn condemned him to perish at the stake, at that time the usual legal punishment of convicted <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. He suffered that cruel death with self-possession and <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> and when about to expire cried out, it is said: "Christ, <a href="14142b.htm">Son of the living God</a>, have mercy on us!" His ashes were thrown into the Rhine. Owing largely to the dramatic circumstances of his death, he became at once the hero of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> patriotism and the martyr-saint of multitudes in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and elsewhere who shared his demagogic and revolutionary principles. They were surely incompatible with either the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or the civil order of the time, and would at any period have bred both religious and civil <a href="01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, had they been put into practice. As to the safe-conduct of the emperor, we must distinguish, says <a href="06322c.htm">Dr. von Funk</a> (Kirchengeschichte, 3d ed., Freiburg, 1902, p. 495, and the more recent literature there quoted; also "Der Katholik", 1898, LXXVIII, 186-90, and K. M&uuml;ller, non-Catholic, in the "Hist. Vierteljahrschrift", 1898, 41-86) between the arrest of <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> and his execution. The former act was always accounted in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> a violation of the safe-conduct and a breach of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> on the emperor's part; on the other hand they <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> well, and so did <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a>, that the safe-conduct was only a guarantee against illegal <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> and could not protect him from the sentence of his legitimate judges. (On the <a href="12565a.htm">death penalty</a> for <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, see <a href="06068a.htm">Ficker</a>, "Die gesetzliche Einf&uuml;hrung der Todestrafe f&uuml;r H&auml;resie" in "Mittheil. d. Inst. f. oest. Geschichtsforschung", 1888, 177 sqq., and Havet, "L'h&eacute;r&eacute;sie et le bras s&eacute;culier au moyen &acirc;ge jusqu'au XIIIe si&egrave;cle", Paris, 1881; see also Gosselin, "Temporal Power of the Pope in the Middle Ages", I, 85-89). In the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> German codes known as the Sachsenspiegel (about 1225) and the Schwabenspiegel (about 1275), <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> is already punishable with the stake. It is not <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that the council declared that no <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> should be kept with a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> (see Pallavicino, "Hist. Conc. Trid.", XII, 15, 8; <a href="07382a.htm">H&ouml;fler</a> in "Hist. polit. Bl&auml;tter", IV, 421, and Hefele, "Conciliengesch.", VII, 227, also Baudrillart, op. cit., II, 1217). In the following year Jerome (Hieronymus) of Prague, the friend of <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a>, suffered the same fate at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>. He had come <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to the council in April, 1415, but soon fled the city; afterwards, mindful of the fate of <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a>, he obtained from the council a safe-conduct to return for his defence. He did not appear, however, and was soon seized in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and brought in chains to <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>. In September, 1415, he <a href="01044d.htm">abjured</a> the forty-five propositions of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> and the thirty of <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a>, but did not regain his freedom, as his sincerity was suspected, and new charges were made against him. Finally, he was brought before the council, 23 May, 1416, one year after his arrest. This time he solemnly withdrew his <a href="01044d.htm">abjuration</a> as a <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a> act and compelled by fear, and proclaimed <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> a <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> and upright man. He was forthwith condemned as a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> in the twenty-first session (30 May, 1416) and perished at the stake with no less <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> than <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a>. The <a href="07538b.htm">humanist</a> Poggio was an eyewitness of his death, and his letter to Leonardo of <a href="01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, describing the scene, may be seen in Hefele, "Conciliengesch.", VII, 280 sqq. The death of both <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> and Jerome of Prague affected strongly other <a href="07538b.htm">humanists</a> of the time; &AElig;neas Sylvius (later <a href="12126c.htm">Pius II</a>) said that they went to their deaths as men invited to a banquet. The immediate consequences were grave enough, i.e. the long Utraquist <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>. For an equitable criticism of the defects in the trials of both <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> and Jerome see Baudrillart in "Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath.", II, 1216-17. (See also <a href="07585a.htm">HUSSITES</a>.)</p>

<h3>Jean Petit (Johannes Parvus) and Johann von Folkenberg</h3>

<p>The question of the licity of <a href="15108a.htm">tyrannicide</a> occupied the attention of the council. The <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Jean Petit (Parvus) had publicly defended (in nine theses) the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> for his share in the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> of Louis d'Orl&eacute;ans (23 Nov., 1407), on the ground that any subject might kill or cause to be killed a tyrannical ruler (<a href="08629a.htm">Kervyn de Lettenhove</a>, Jean sans peur et l'apologie du tyrannicide, Brussels, 1861). After several years of discussion this thesis was condemned at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1414 by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the inquisitor, and the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. The Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> appealed to the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. At <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> the matter was discussed in the fifteenth session (6 July, 1415); many French <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> were eager for the formal condemnation of Petit and his theses, but his <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> brethren defended him in a common memorial; the council finally was content with condemning in a general way the proposition that, regardless of his <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> and without awaiting a judicial sentence, any vassal or subject might licitly kill, or cause to be killed, a tyrant. Quite similar was the case of Johann von Falkenberg, a German <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, who had maintained in a violent work against the King of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> that it was allowed to kill him and all other Poles (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Conc., XXVII, 765). Many demanded with much earnestness the condemnation of Falkenberg, but no definite sentence was pronounced, despite the ardent discussions (see <a href="15108a.htm">TYRANNICIDE</a>), not even in the forty-fifth (last) session when the Poles urged it on <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>; he declared that in matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> he would approve only what had been decided by the holy general council <em>conciliariter</em>, i.e. by the whole council and not by one or more nations. As noted above, these words of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> refer only to the particular (Falkenberg) matter before him and not to all the decrees of the council, even in matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Attendance at the council; general considerations</h2>

<p>Owing to its long duration the attendance at the council varied much. The highest figures reached were: 29 <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 3 <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, 33 <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 150 <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 100 <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, 50 provosts, 300 <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> (mostly of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>). It was calculated that some 5000 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were present and in all about 18,000 <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. The visitors are variously reckoned from 50,000 to 100,000 or more. Many <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> sovereigns and princes were present, invited by the emperor, among them (besides Emperor Sigismund and his suite) the Electors Ludwig von der Pfalz and Rudolph of Saxony, the Dukes of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>, <a href="10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>, <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, and Teck, the Margrave of Brandenburg, also the ambassadors of the Kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and the Spanish kingdoms. Towards the end the Greek emperor, Michael Pal&aelig;ologus, was also present (19 Feb., 1418, with 19 Greek <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>). In some respects the council resembled more a modern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congress than a traditional <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> synod. The numerous princes and nobles by their tournaments and splendid amusements; the merchants by their rich and curious wares; the travellers by their number and importance; the fringe of fakirs and mountebanks found at all popular gatherings, made <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> for the time the cynosure of all <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and even of the Greek world. There is, of course, no reason to wonder that in so motley a throng, suddenly gathered from all quarters, moral disorders and loose living should have manifested themselves. Quite apart from the reliability or animus of some gossipy chroniclers, the council was directly responsible only for its own acts and not for the life of the city of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>. It must also be remembered that in one way or another unforeseen events and situations protracted the council beyond all ordinary prevision. Among these were: the flight of <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>; the lengthy process of <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>; the general jealousy and dislike of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and in turn, the natural efforts of the latter to save the ecclesiastical constitution from thorough ruin at the unhappiest moment for the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, hitherto its <a href="14303a.htm">corner-stone</a>; the passionate longing for a public canonical purification of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> from its acknowledged abuses and excrescences (in the head and in the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>). We need not wonder that at the end of his remarkable diary of the council, Cardinal Guillaume Fillastre wrote as follows (Finke ed., Forschungen und Quellen, p. 242): "Hoc Constantiense concilium ... omnibus qu&aelig; precesserunt generalibus conciliis fuit in congregando difficilius, in progressu singularius, mirabilius et periculosius, et tempore diuturnius", i.e. no previous council was gotten together with so much difficulty, or ran a career so unique, marvellous and perilous, or lasted so long. From an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> point of view, the Council of Constance may truly be said to close the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> and to open the modern period. It was an anti-climax for the all-dominant <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, while in Sigismund (Emperor-elect, King of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, heir of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, etc.) for the last time appears a pale image of the ideal office of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> empire. The language of its orators and its "Acta" exhibits a certain dawn of <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a> (Finke) while there for the first time modern nationalism, quite different from its <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> prototype, comes to the front, dominates the entire situation, menaces even the immemorial <a href="15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, and begins its long career of discordant relations with the central administration of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> (see <a href="06351a.htm">GALLICANISM</a>; <a href="07463a.htm">JOHANN HONTHEIM</a>). Not a few elements of the later <a href="12700b.htm">ecclesiastical revolution</a> under <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> are already visibly present at Constance. The German nation in particular remained grievously discontented with the local results of the second of the great reform councils (Pisa, <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Basle), and throughout the fifteenth century sought variously, but with little success, to realize the demands put forth at the Council of Constance.
