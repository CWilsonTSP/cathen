<p>An autonomous branch of the first <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, the other branches being the <a href="06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> simply so called (but until lately usually known as Observants or Recollects), and the <a href="04344a.htm">Conventual Friars Minor</a>. This division of the first <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> has come about by reason of various <a href="12711a.htm">reforms</a>; thus the Observants were a reform which separated from the <a href="04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, and the Capuchins are a reform of the Observants.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Genesis and development</h2>

<p>The Capuchin Reform dates from 1525. It had its origin in the Marches, the Italian province where, after Umbria, the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> spirit seems to have found its most congenial dwelling-place. Cut off by the mountains from the great highways of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the inhabitants of the Marches have to this day retained a delightful simplicity of character and blend a mystical tendency with a practical bent of mind. They may be said to possess the anima naturaliter Franciscana, and it is easy to understand the quick response of the people of this province to the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> teaching, and the tenacity with which the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of the Marches clung to the primitive simplicity of the order. We have a monument of the enduring vigour of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> spirit in the Marches in the "Fioretti di San Francesco", wherein the first freshness of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> spirit seems to have been caught up and enshrined. From the Marches, too, we get another book, of a very different character, but which in its own way bears eloquent witness to the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the brethren of this province for poverty, the "Historia VII Tribulationum" of Angelo Clareno. And at <a href="03216c.htm">Camerino</a>, on the borders of the province, are preserved the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="08475c.htm">Blessed John of Parma</a>, another of the leaders of the "Spiritual" Friars. The Marches were, in fact, from the earliest days of the order, a centre of resistance to the secularizing tendency which found an entrance amongst the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> even in the days of <a href="06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>, of which tendency the famous Brother Elias is the historic type.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>At the beginning of the sixteenth century the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in the Marches, as elsewhere, were divided into the two distinct <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> and Observants or Zoccolanti. The dividing line between the two <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> was their adhesion to the primitive ideal of <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> poverty and simplicity; the <a href="04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> accepted revenues by <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>; the Observants refused fixed revenues and lived by casual <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>. At least such was the principle; but in practice the Observants had come themselves to relax the principle under various legal devices. Thus, though they would not accept money themselves, they allowed secular <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, styled syndics, to accept money for their use; they accepted chaplaincies to which were affixed regular stipends. To those who looked to the primitive custom of the order, such acceptances seemed but legalized betrayal of the rule, nor were these relaxations at any time allowed to pass without protest from the more <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> of the Observants. But the question was not merely concerning this or that point; it was one of general tendency. Was the order to maintain itself in the simplicity and unworldliness of St. Francis, or was it to admit and bow to the spirit of the world? Was it to be dominated by the spirit of St. Francis or by the spirit of Brother Elias? Such was the question as it shaped itself in the minds of the reforming <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>; and one has to recognize this truly to appreciate the history of the various <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> reforms. The difficulty which met each reform, as it arose and acquired an independent constitution, was the difficulty which meets every unworldly ideal in its attempt to propagate itself in the actual world. To live on and endure it must take to itself a secular embodiment, and in the process is apt to acquire something of the secular spirit; and the more unworldly the original ideal, the more difficult is its process of secular development. This is peculiarly so in the case of a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> community like the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, which aims at realizing a principle of life so entirely opposed to the principles commonly accepted in the world at large. Hence it is that the Observants, after breaking away from the <a href="04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, themselves gave rise to various reforms which aimed at a more perfect return to the primitive type. In this way the Capuchin Reform took its origin from amongst the Observants of the Marches. The leader of the reform was Father Matteo di Bassi, a member of the Observant community in the <a href="06043c.htm">Diocese of Fermo</a>. He was an exemplary religious and a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> preacher. It is said that <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> had given him permission to institute a reform amongst the Observants; but if so Father Matteo did not avail himself of the permission, perhaps because of the death of that pontiff. But in 1525, a year of Jubilee, he went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and whilst there obtained from <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> leave to wear the Capuchin habit and to live in strictest poverty. Matteo di Bassi was finally led to this step by an incident which recalls to mind the history of St. Francis. The friar had been attending a funeral and was returning to his <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, when he met a beggar by the wayside barely clad. Moved with compassion, Father Matteo gave the beggar part of his own clothing. Shortly afterwards the friar was in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> when he heard a voice, which three times admonished him, saying "Observe the Rule to the letter". Whereupon he arose, and took an old habit, and made a long pointed hood out of the cappa, and donning the habit at once set out for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This story, retailed by all the earliest chroniclers, makes it certain that the aspiration to observe the rule to the letter was the one compelling motive of the reform, and that the taking of the habit with the long pointed hood was the symbol of this aspiration. For the habit in this shape was supposed to be the original form of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit, whilst the habit with the cappa and small rounded hood was held by many to be an innovation introduced with the spirit of relaxation. Certain it is that the habit adopted by Father Matteo and his followers was known in the order before their time. In the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, is a copy of an <a href="01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fifteenth century, representing <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> with a number of <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> gathered under her outspread mantle; and they are wearing a habit similar in form to that of the Capuchins. In a picture of St. Francis in the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="03699a.htm">Christchurch</a>, <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, attributed to Margaritone, we find the same form of habit; and in at least one other instance of early portraiture of the Seraphic saint he seems to have been represented with a habit of this sort. (See "On the Authentic Portraiture of St. Francis of Assisi", by N. H. J. Westlake, London, 1897.) <a href="14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a> again seems to speak of it as a novelty that a certain friar went about wearing a habit "with the hood not sewn to the tunic" (II Celano, 32 &#151; ed. d'Alen&ccedil;on, Rome, 1906). And at the Ognisanti, in <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, is preserved a habit, said to be one worn by St. Francis, the hood of which is sewn to the tunic. At any rate the reforming <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, in assuming the pointed hood sewn to the habit, claimed to be assuming the form of habit worn by St. Francis and the first <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, and in their eyes it was a symbol of their return to the primitive observance.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In putting his hand to the reform, Matteo di Bassi had no intention of separating himself from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Observants; he thought rather to introduce the reform amongst them. All he asked from <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> was liberty for himself and other <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of a like mind to wear the habit of St. Francis, to observe the rule strictly in accordance with the earliest tradition, and to preach the Word of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in the world. From the days of St. Francis himself the liberty of the stricter observance had been allowed; and the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> enjoying such liberty had usually dwelt apart in small houses or hermitages, but under the effective <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the superiors of the order. But when, on Matteo di Bassi's return from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, two other <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, Louis of <a href="06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a> and his brother Raphael, sought to join the new reform, they were stoutly opposed by the superiors, especially by the minister provincial, John of <a href="05785a.htm">Fano</a>, who, however, himself eventually joined the Capuchins. Nevertheless, the two <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were at length, through the intervention of the Duke of <a href="03216c.htm">Camerino</a> allowed to proceed to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 18 May, 1526, they received from the <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, the Grand Penitentiary, the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>, "Ex parte vestr&acirc;", whereby <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> formally allowed them, together with Matteo di Bassi, to separate from the community of the Observants and live in hermitages, in order that they might be free to observe the rule as they desired; and, to protect them against molestation on the part of the superiors of the order, they were placed under the protection of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03216c.htm">Camerino</a>. They were by the same <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> permitted to aggregate others to their manner of life. They were, however, still considered to belong to the Observant <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, though separated from the community; but on 3 July, 1528, owing to the continued opposition of the Observant superiors, <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Religionis zellus", released them from their obedience to the Observants and constituted them a distinct <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the order, in a certain dependence, however, upon the Master-General of the <a href="04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, to whom it belonged to confirm the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to be elected by the new reform.</p>

<p>In the following April, 1529, the first chapter was held at Albacina. At this time the reform numbered eighteen <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> and four <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> or hermitages. Matteo di Bassi having been elected <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the chapter drew up the new constitutions designed to safeguard the primitive observance of the rule. No one can read these "Constitutions of Albacina" without being struck with the similarity of tone and purpose between them and the "Speculum Perfectionis", about which so much has been heard since M. Paul Sabatier published his edition in 1898. The provisions relating to poverty and studies would almost seem an echo of that celebrated legend. Thus, when "hermitages or <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>" are to be erected, the constitutions <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> that no more land is to be taken than is in keeping with their poor estate; the houses are to be built, if possible, of mud and wattles, but earth and stones may be used where wattles cannot be obtained; the churches, however, shall be of more becoming structure, yet small and narrow. The <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> are to bear in mind the admonition of St. Francis that their churches and houses must be such as to proclaim that those who dwell in them are but <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and strangers on the earth. The houses are to be built outside the cities or towns, yet not far distant from them. In the houses near large cities not more than twelve <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> might dwell, and in the other houses not more than eight &#151; "for such indeed was the will of St. Francis as is set forth in the chronicles of the Order." The proprietorships must always be vested in the municipality or the donor, who may turn the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> out at will, and should this happen the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> are to go out at once without delay and seek another place. To each house a hermitage must be attached, where the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> may retire for solitary contemplation. In regard to <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> they were not to quest for meat, eggs, or cheese, but they might receive these things when offered spontaneously. They were never, however, to lay in a store of food, but to depend on daily <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>. At the utmost they might receive sufficient food to last for three days, and rarely for one week. They are forbidden to have syndics or procurators to receive <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> for them. &#151; "No other syndic shall there be for us save Christ our Lord; and our <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> and protector shall be the most <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed virgin Mother of God</a>; our deputy shall be our blessed Father Francis; but all other procurators we absolutely reject." The preachers were to be kept busy in the vineyard of the Lord, not only during <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>, but at all other times. They were not, however, allowed to use many books; two or three at most were deemed sufficient. They sermons were to be simple and plain, without studied rhetoric; nor were they to be allowed to receive any remuneration for their preaching. Classes for the study of literature were not be established; but they might study the Scriptures and such devout authors as "love <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and teach us to embrace the Cross of Christ". The <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were not to hear the confessions of seculars except in cases of extreme necessity. In the houses of the order only one Mass was to be said each day, at which all the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> should be present, except on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and solemn feasts, when all might celebrate; nor were they to receive any honoraria for Masses. They were, moreover, forbidden to follow funerals or celebrate dirges, except in case of necessity. Finally, they were to go barefoot, shod only in simple sandals; and to recite the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> at midnight even on the three last days of <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>; and on no account were extra Offices to be added to the canonical Office, so that the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> might have more time for private <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>Such were the "Constitutions of Albacina". Their intention is evident to any one conversant with the early <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> legends: they sought to re-establish the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> life in the spirit and letter of the earliest <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> tradition. One point needs explanation here. In the earliest pontifical documents concerning the new reform, it is stated that the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> are to be free to observe the rule strictly in the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life. The meaning of this, however, was not that they should be <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> in the sense of living always a retired and solitary life. Matteo di Bassi had asked of <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> liberty to observe the Rule of St. Francis in hermitages, to preach the Word of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in the world, and to bring sinners to repentance. The preaching of the Word of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> was an essential feature of the Capuchin reform. We have already seen how the constitutions of the order bade the preachers be frequently employed in their work of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> at all times of the year. Matteo di Bassi himself had no sooner received the sanction of <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> than he returned to the Marches and began to preach and to nurse the sick during the pestilence which swept through the Marches in 1525. The explanation, however, is simple enough to those who <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> legends. Amongst the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> the hermitage stood in opposition to the large <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>. The first houses of the order were built outside the city walls in some quiet spot where the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, when not engaged in active ministry for others, could live undisturbedly in the cultivation of the spirit. These houses were small, and only a few <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> dwelt in the same place. Besides the small communities, there were also hermitages, technically so called, at some distance from the community, whither the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> might retire for a still more secluded life. The original <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> life was thus a commingling of the active life with the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a>. As the order increased in numbers, large <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> were built in which the simplicity and seclusion of the original <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> community were in great measure lost; in these large houses it became impossible to observe the primitive standard of poverty, and the tendency was to conform to the more complex life and ceremonial of the monastic orders, properly so called. Hence every reform of the order turned again towards the ideal of the small community and the more secluded situation, where the original simplicity and poverty could more easily be maintained.</p>

<p>Matteo di Bassi remained <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the reform only for two months; then he resigned his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> into the hands of Louis of <a href="06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a>, as commissary general, in order that he might be free to give himself to the work of the apostolate. From this time he can hardly be said to belong to the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the reform; though he seems to have still availed himself of the privileges granted him in 1525 by <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>. He died in 1552 and was buried in the church of the Observants in <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where his body was for a long time accorded the honours given to the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of a <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, until a recent <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congregation of Sacred Rites restricted such honours to those formally <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a>. But though not formally <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a>, Matte di Bassi is styled 'Blessed" in the <a href="09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> of the order. During the government of Louis of <a href="06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a> the reform began to spread quickly and widely. Shortly after the Chapter of Albacina the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were invited to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and given a house, Santa Maria dei Miracoli, near the Flaminian Gate, from which they removed in the following year to the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Santa Euphemia near Santa Maria Maggiore. Meanwhile a movement for reform was taking place amongst the Observants of Calabria, which was to have a marked influence upon the development of the reform in the Marches. Two <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, Louis of <a href="12717a.htm">Reggio</a> and Bernardine of <a href="12717a.htm">Reggio</a>, surnamed lo Giorgio, had, about the same time that Matteo di Bassi had visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, also arrived in the <a href="13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, and with the sanction of <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> had attempted to reform movement amongst the Observants of Santi Apostoli. Their efforts proving futile, they obtained leave, in 1526, to return to Calabria and choose three <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> for their purpose. They assumed the name of Recollects - a name very generally given to the reforming <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, for the reason stated above. Here, as in the Marches, the superiors of the Observants regarded the reform with disfavour and treated the reformers as rebellious subjects; hence, at a chapter held by the Minister General of the Observants, at <a href="10216a.htm">Messina</a>, in 1532, the Calabrian Recollects petitioned to be allowed to pass to the Capuchin <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Their petition, however, only drew upon them further rebuke. As they continued to persist in their demand, the minister general obtained from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against them; but this was shortly withdrawn through the intervention of the Duke of <a href="11086c.htm">Nocera</a> and the Duchess of <a href="03216c.htm">Camerino</a>, and the Calabrian Recollects passed into the Capuchin <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, forming the first province of the order outside of Marches.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Following the example of the Calabrians, the most <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> Observants began to pass over to the Capuchins in such numbers that <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, at the instance of the Minister General of the Observants, issued two Briefs, the first <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 18 December, 1534, and the second 12 January, 1535, forbidding any more Observants to be received by the Capuchins until the next general chapter of the Observant <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. The second of these Briefs is noteworthy by reason of the fact that in it the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of the new reform are for the first time called Capucini &#151; Capuchins. Hitherto, in the pontifical documents they had been styled Fratres Ord. S. Francisci Capucciati. But in the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 12 January, 1535, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> adopted the name already conferred upon the new reform by the populace, who, seeing the long hoods, at once called the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> Cappuccini. Henceforth the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> are officially styled "Friars Minor of the Order of St. Francis, Capuchin".</p>

<p>At the chapter of the order held at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in November, 1535, Bernardine of <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a> was elected <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. He was a remarkable man &#151; the genius and saviour of the new reform. He combined great <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and power of organization with a rare <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> and sweetness of character. He had held high office amongst the Observants before he joined the Capuchins in 1534. He died in 1554, and is styled blessed in the <a href="09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. His election was providential, for the Capuchin <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> had now to pass through a time of storm and stress, which the wisdom and fame of Bernardine of <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a>, in great measure, enabled it to survive. Hardly had Bernardine of <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a> taken up the reins of government than Louis of <a href="06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a> created a disturbance amongst the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, alleging that the election was invalid. He himself had aspired to the headship of the order. A new chapter was thereupon convoked, in April, 1536, and Bernardine of <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a> was again elected, whereupon Louis of <a href="06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a> threw off the habit and <a href="01624b.htm">apostatized</a>. His apostasy perhaps influenced <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a> when on 3 January, 1537, he forbade the Capuchins to establish any houses of their reform outside <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. But a greater blow fell in 1542 when <a href="02505b.htm">Bernardine of Siena</a> &#151; the famous Occhino, not to be confounded with Saint Bernardine, who d. in 1444 &#151; the successor of Bernardine of <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a> as <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, <a href="01624b.htm">apostatized</a> and joined the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant Reformers</a>. The <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> caused by this defection gave new vigour to the efforts of those who were opposed to the Capuchins, and at this time it was seriously considered at the Roman Court whether they should be suppressed. In fact it was generally said amongst the people that their suppression was already decreed. To dispel this rumour the new <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Francis of <a href="08372a.htm">Jesi</a>, assembled two hundred of his brethren at <a href="01801a.htm">Assisi</a> for the feast of the Portiuncula, in 1543. But it was Bernardine of <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a> who pleaded the cause of the reform at the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and averted the threatened disaster. And by his eloquent pleading he saved not only the new reform from extinction, but also the essential character of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. For the <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> Fathers had resolved that in future all <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders should possess common <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, and not be dependent upon <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>. This resolution struck at the very fundamental principle of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> life, since, according to the Rule of St. Francis, his <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were to possess <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> neither individually nor in common, but to depend for their daily sustenance upon their labour and upon <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>. As St. Francis had pleaded for this absolute poverty before <a href="08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, so Bernardine of <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a> now pleaded before the council, and with such success that the Capuchin Friars and the Observants were expressly exempted from the general law and allowed the privilege of common, as well as of individual, poverty. By a providential coincidence, whilst the fate of the new reform was hanging in the balance, it received a new recruit in a poor countryman who was destined perhaps more than anyone else to establish the Capuchin <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> in the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> and veneration of the Roman people: this was St. Felix of Cantalicio, the <a href="09093a.htm">lay brother</a> friend of <a href="12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>. But in a short while the cloud passed away, and the Capuchin <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> grew with amazing swiftness in numbers and in fame. At the chapter of 1536 the reform numbered five hundred <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>; in 1587 it had increased to five thousand nine hundred and fifty-three <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>. In 1574 <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> revoked the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, and granted Capuchins the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to establish ultramontane provinces; and in 1619 the reform was released from all dependence upon the <a href="04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, and given a minister general of its own election. It need hardly be said that, as the order increased in numbers and spread to various countries, it was found <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to modify the stringent regulations of the first constitutions. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> compelled the Capuchins to establish courses of studies for the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> destined for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; larger <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> were built, and the regulation forbidding the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> to hear the concessions of secular people was rescinded. Yet a constant effort was made to maintain the simplicity of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> life. Notwithstanding the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the Capuchins obtained from <a href="12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> for their <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> the privilege of voting in the elections of the order, thus conserving the original democratic character of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan family</a>. In the ordinances of the general chapter of 1613 great stress was laid on simplicity of life, and regulations were made forbidding such innovations as high masses and introduction of spiritual exercises for <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>, after the manner of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The same spirit and intention are found in the definitive constitutions formally approved by <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, in 1643. This pontiff had already, by a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred congregation of Bishops and Regulars (30 April, 1627), declared the Capuchins to be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> sons of St. Francis, and on 28 June of the same year had issued the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Salvatoris et Domini", in which he reaffirmed a former constitution of <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, "Ecclesi&aelig; Militantis", of 15 October, 1608, setting forth that the Capuchins are the spiritual descendants of St. Francis in the direct line, and not a mere offshoot of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>.</p>

<p>In the time of <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> the reform numbered over seventeen thousand <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> in forty-two provinces; a century later, at the general chapter of 1754, there were representatives from sixty-three provinces, and the number of the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> was given as thirty-two thousand eight hundred and twenty-one. But during the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the order suffered severely; nearly all the provinces were disorganized or suppressed; and in the subsequent revolutions on the <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> continent the Capuchins suffered the fate of all the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, being continually oppressed and dispersed. Yet during the last twenty years a notable revival has taken place. In 1889 the order had 636 houses and 7852 <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>; in 1906 there were 731 houses and 9970 <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, divided into 56 provinces.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Influence of the reform upon the general history of the Church</h2>

<p>The Capuchins, together with the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, were the most effective preachers and missionaries of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. We have already seen that the privilege granted by <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> to Matteo di Bassi was not only to observe the Rule of St. Francis in its primitive simplicity, but also to go about preaching the Word of God. In this matter the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of the reform were but reasserting the primitive <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> life; and it is to be noted that the method of their apostolate was also thoroughly in accord with what the early legends of the order tell us about St. Francis's method. In their preaching they eschewed artificial oratory and set forth their message with simplicity and directness which came from the heart. But perhaps what most endeared them to the people, and gave them that singular power with all classes to which the history of the times bears witness, was their all-embracing charity. The picture of the Capuchin friar drawn by <a href="09634a.htm">Manzoni</a> in "I Promessi Sposi" is historical. In their apostolate they not merely preached from the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpits</a>; they mingled in the daily life of the people, ministering to suffering humanity in its temporal as well as its spiritual needs. In the frequent pestilences which devastated <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> generally in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Capuchins were constantly found doing a notable part in the service of the sick. The annals of the order and the chronicles of the times tell us of the heroism of the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> in the pestilences which swept through Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1589, through <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in 1609, through <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1611. In the great pestilence of 1630 the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> took charge of the lazarettos at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and acted as confessors, nurses, cooks, and dispensers to the victims. They did the same at <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> and <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>. At <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were assembled for the provincial chapter when the pestilence broke out; they prorogued the chapter and went out to nurse the sick, and forty-three of them fell victims to their charity. During the pestilence of 1636 in Franche-Comt&eacute;, so many Capuchins died in ministering to the sick that <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> allowed young <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> to be <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> before the canonical age to take the place of those who had succumbed. <a href="02787e.htm">St. Laurence of Brindisi</a>, sent as missionary Apostolic to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1599, began his apostolate by nursing the sick in the pestilence of that year. Undoubtedly their universal charity, united to the austerity of their lives, accounts for much of their success as missionaries, whether with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or non-Catholics.</p>

<p>And not only were they popular with the multitude; they had the confidence of the authorities. This is shown in the frequent choice of the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> by the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and princes to fill responsible positions. Thus in the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> in the sixteenth century, it was usually the Capuchins who were appoint ed <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and spiritual directors to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> forces. In the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> expedition of 1571, a number of Capuchins accompanied the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> navy by command of <a href="12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, and at the battle of <a href="09181b.htm">Lepanto</a>, Father Anselmo da Pietramolara was in the thick of the fight, urging on the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> forces with raised crucifix; in fact, it was his indomitable <a href="06147a.htm">bravery</a> which prevented the ship he was in from being captured by the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were similarly employed in the struggles of the German princes against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> in the seventeenth century. <a href="02787e.htm">St. Laurence of Brindisi</a>, in 1610, went as <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> general with the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> army, and so did Venerable Mark of Aviano, in 1687. It is pleasing to note that the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> obtained, from <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, power to absolve <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> who, during the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, freed or hid captive <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>.</p>

<p>They were moreover not infrequently commissioned to transact affairs of state. <a href="02787e.htm">St. Laurence of Brindisi</a> was sent as ambassador by the Emperor Rudolph to solicit the alliance of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> with the Catholic League of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> employed the Capuchins to negotiate for the ransom of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives in <a href="01311a.htm">Algiers</a>. Father Giacinto da Casale was commissioned by <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> to unite the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in defence of the Faith. Sometimes their personal influence, without any official status, enabled them to intervene with success in public matters, as in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, when the canton of Appenzell was hesitating whether to ally itself with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons or with the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, the Capuchins went in and drew Appenzell to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side. In similar fashion, in 1637, a <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Capuchin acted as arbitrator in the canton of Aargau. These public acts testify to the great influence acquired by the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; but their influence was gained by hard and strenuous labours both as home and as foreign missionaries. They were to be found everywhere, preaching and ministering to the people. Not only were they established in almost every country of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, but as foreign missionaries their activity seems almost incredible. At the general chapter of 1662 the list of foreign missions served by the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> included the Congo, Benin, <a href="10574a.htm">Morocco</a>, <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, Mingrelia, <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, Mesopotamia, Chaldea, Ecbatana, Kurdistan, <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>, Tatary, <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, <a href="04121b.htm">New Granada</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, Morea, the Grecian Archipelago, whilst they also had missions, under <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, in Rh&aelig;tia, the Grisons, and the Valtellina.</p>

<p>As "home" missionaries they were mainly instrumental in reforming the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, substituting solid teaching, with burning and convincing <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, for the vapid rhetoric so common amongst the preachers of the sixteenth century. Their object was always to reach the heart of the people. To be convinced of the solidity and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> of their preaching, one has only to consult the many books of sermons and treatises of devotion which the missionary <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> have left us. According to <a href="02304b.htm">Baronius</a> and the chroniclers of the order, the devotion of the Quarant' Ore owes its origin to the missionary <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the Capuchins. Father Giuseppe da Ferno is said to have been the first to expose the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> for forty hours' <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, during a mission he was preaching in the Duomo at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, in 1637. Giuseppe da Ferno certainly wrote a treatise on the method of the Quarant' Ore, and from this time we find frequent mention of the devotion in the missionary chronicles of the order. But the supreme monument to their missionary <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> is the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a> itself. This congregation was instituted by <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, in 1622, at the suggestion of Father Girolamo da Narni, <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the Reform. He was a noted preacher and experienced in missionary labours. When the congregation was established, its first prefect was the Capuchin <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Sant' Onofrio; and its first <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> was another Capuchin, <a href="06069a.htm">St. Fidelis of Sigmaringen</a>, whom the propaganda had appointed Prefect of the Mission of Rh&aelig;tia. The <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> had already been established for some years in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, whither they had been called by <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> in his capacity as Protector of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in those parts. The saint, backed by <a href="07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a>, had requested the general chapter of 1581 to send <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> thither, and the chapter had at once acceded to the request. Such was their success in combating the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> and in preserving the Faith in many cantons that to this day they are accorded a privileged position in the churches of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons as confessors and preachers. It was in the Grisons that Saint Fidelis was <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a>, in 1622. Here the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> had practically gained over the whole population, as also in the Valtellina, and only by heroic efforts were the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> able to keep alive any remnant of the Faith. The missions in these parts are still under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Capuchins.</p>

<p>In <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, under the leadership of Father Cherubino da Mariana, the friend of St. Francis of Sales, were at work in 1596, and the mission of Thonon was especially given into their charge in 1610. Father Cherubino also introduced the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> into the Vallese in 1610, at which time, as St. Francis of Sales reported, the religious condition of that country seemed hopeless. Under <a href="02787e.htm">St. Laurence of Brindisi</a> twelve Capuchins were sent, in 1599, to combat the influence of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where by their public controversies with <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, as well as by their preaching, they did much to win back many to the Faith. They rapidly established houses in all parts of Southern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and in 1611 they were established in the Rhine Provinces by Father Francis Nugent, a distinguished <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> friar.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On the foreign missions they were equally energetic. The first foreign mission was undertaken in 1551, when two <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were commissioned by <a href="08564a.htm">Julius III</a> to go to Constantinople. They were, however, expelled, after being <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and tortured. But we find them shortly afterwards in Crete, where Father Ignazio d'Apiro established five missionary centres in two years, besides a <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> at <a href="03249a.htm">Canea</a>. He was a man well versed in Oriental languages. He died in 1569. About this time two Capuchins were <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> in Palestine. But it was at the general chapter of 1581 that the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> put their hand definitively to the matter of foreign missions. They then obtained a faculty from <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> to send missionaries to the East, and a band of <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, amongst whom was <a href="08521b.htm">St. Joseph of Leonessa</a>, were despatched to Constantinople. Imprisonment and torture awaited them; but from that time the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> have held fast to their missions in the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> dominions. In 1623 the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> commissioned the Capuchins to found missions in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>. Six <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were sent to Constantinople, where they at once established a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for the study of Oriental languages; others went to <a href="01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, Alexandria, and <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. Their method was to open <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> wherever they settled, and they were active in publishing books. As a result of their labours in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> at this time, a <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and a <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Greek <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> sought reunion with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1618 the general chapter, at the request of <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, sent missionaries to the Congo. They encountered great difficulties, owing to the <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> traders, and success seemed hopeless. Yet they struggled on till 1654, when a fresh effort was made, and a new band of missionaries was sent out, including <a href="03468c.htm">Father G. Antonio Cavazzi</a>, the writer of a well-known work on the Congo.</p>

<p>From Aleppo <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were sent, in 1630, to Cairo, under the leader ship of the Blessed Agathange de Vend&ocirc;me, one of the most remarkable missionaries of the seventeenth century. He was an Arabic scholar, and had published books in Arabic setting forth the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. On the coming of the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> to Cairo <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> addressed a letter to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, bidding them welcome the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> and accord them every assistance. But unhappily the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> found that their work amongst the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>, for whose reunion with the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman See</a> they more particularly laboured, was hindered chiefly by the <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> lives of the <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> merchants. Yet the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> obtained leave from the <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> to preach in the churches of the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> even granted them permission to celebrate <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the same churches. Father Agathange's influence with the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> was such that he persuaded the Coptic patriarch to appoint for the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> in <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> who would live in peace with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1637 Father Agathange, together with Father Cassian de <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, entered <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, but owing to the treachery of a German <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> they were at once seized and <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and the following year suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. The Capuchin mission in <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> was thus brought swiftly to a close, but only to be renewed in later years. Towards the end of the last century the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were again established in the dominions of the Negus, chiefly through the exertions of the celebrated Capuchin missionary afterwards known as Cardinal Massa&iuml;a. He has left a record of his experiences in his book, "I miei trentacinque anni nell' alta Etiopia" (Rome and <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1895).</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the seventeenth century the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> established missions in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> at Surat, Pegu, Golconda, and Madras, and a little later at <a href="12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>. The story of their Indian missions is much the same as elsewhere; they established <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, wrote books in the vernacular of the country, held public conferences with the learned <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and found their chief obstacle in the <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> traders &#151; in this case, the Portuguese. At the present day the missions in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> are amongst the most important in the order: the <a href="01225a.htm">Archdiocese of Agra</a> (the premier diocese in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>), the Dioceses of <a href="08742c.htm">Lahore</a> and Allahabad, and the Prefecture of Rajputana, are entirely served by Capuchins. They still carry on their work in <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, where they have a flourishing missionary <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. Other present-day missions are in Central and South America, in <a href="01663a.htm">Arabia</a> and Somaliland, in the Seychelles, <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, and Caroline Islands, in <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> and Mesopotamia; whilst in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> they carry on missionary work in Constantinople and <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. In 1906 eight hundred and fifty-five <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of the reform were engaged in foreign missionary labour.</p>

<p>The reform has produced few writers of the first order in literature or scholarship, though the "Bibliotheca Scriptorum Ord. Min. Cap." (Genoa, 1680; Venice, 1747) gives the names of a great number of writers and goodly list of works, many of them of no mean merit. But most of their writings are connected with their apostolic labours &#151; books of sermons, devotional treatises, and works dealing with the history of the missions. In this last department they have produced several valuable works, such as <a href="03468c.htm">Cavazzi's</a> treatise on the Congo, <a href="03349a.htm">Dionigi Carli's</a> book on the customs, rites, and religion of the people of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, Merolla da Sorrento's account of the Congo and South Africa, and Cardinal Massa&iuml;a's work on <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>. In the seventeenth century the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> Capuchins were noted for their studies of Oriental languages, and in view of the present revival of the Celtic tongues, it may be recalled that a Breton Capuchin, Gregorius de Rostrenen, published in 1732 "Dictionarium Gallo-Celticum, seu Gallo-Aremoricum" (Rennes, 1732) and "Grammatica cum Syntaxi Gallo-Celtica, seu Gallo-Aremorica" (Rennes, 1738). In <a href="05692b.htm">Scriptural exegesis</a> <a href="12075c.htm">Bernardine a Piconio</a> has a deservedly high name as the author of the "Triplex expositio" (1706), whilst in the sixteenth century Francis Titelmann, who left the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> chair of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> to put on the habit of St. Francis, gained <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> repute by his treatises on Scripture and his controversy with <a href="05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>. Amongst devotional writings, the works of Gaetano da Bergamo, published in the first half of the eighteenth century, have an enduring value; his treatise on <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> and meditations on the Passion have both been translated into English. Benedict Canfield's treatise "On the Holy Will of God" has an enduring place in ascetical literature. Amongst modern <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of merit a place must be given to Albert of Bulsano; and as an authority on canon law the <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Capuchin <a href="16067a.htm">Piatus</a> is much esteemed. In the late revival of <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> historical studies, P&egrave;re Edouard d'Alen&ccedil;on has issued new editions of the "Sacrum Commercium" (Rome, 1900), and the legends of <a href="14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a> (Rome, 1906). Amongst the chroniclers of the order the first place must be given to Boverius, a man of great learning not only as an historian, but as a controversial writer of the sixteenth century. In 1640 Carolus de Arembergh published at Cologne "Flores Seraphici", a voluminous work concerning the noted members of the order.</p>

<p>But the Capuchin <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> have at all times been men of action rather than students, and the enormous influence they possessed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was due to their extensive labours as home and foreign missionaries and to the universality of their genius in dealing with the spiritual needs of the people. Amongst the special marks of favour shown them by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> must be mentioned their custody of the Holy House of Loreto, given to them in 1608, and the fact that since 1596 they have had the privilege of supplying the Apostolic preacher at the Roman court. <a href="15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> was a special patron of the order. His friendship with the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> was in part due to the fact that his brother, Antonio Barberini, afterwards <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Sant' Onofrio, was a member of the order. This <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> built for them the famous <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Barberini in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the architect of which was himself a Capuchin friar, Fra Michaele da Bergamo; and the new church attached to the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was the first church in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be dedicated in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. The <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was opened with great solemnity on 15 April, 1631, and <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> signalized the event by appointing Fra Michaele architect of the Apostolic palace. The <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was the headquarters of the order until a few years ago, when the minister general and his curia were expelled by the Italian government, which now uses the greater part of the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> as a barracks, leaving only a few <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> to take care of the church. We may here take note that the reform has given many <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; sixteen of its members have been <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> or <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a>, and the cause of others is in process at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with a view to <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a>.</p>

<p>That the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> came in for much of the abuse levelled against the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and especially against the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, only testifies to their influence and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Except the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, no <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order has, perhaps been more vilely lampooned. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, during the seventeenth century, book after book appeared defaming the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>; one of these was translated into English and published in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> in 1671 under the title of "The Monk's Hood pull'd off, or the Capuchin Fryar described".</p>

<h2 id="section3">The reform in English-speaking countries</h2>

<p>It was in 1599 that the first <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of the reform came to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. These were Father Benedict Canfield, an Englishman, and Father Chrysostom, a Scotchman. Benedict Canfield was of <a href="12581a.htm">Puritan</a> parentage, but had embraced the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> whilst yet a student. As a friar he was reputed a powerful preacher, and was a writer of note. But he had hardly landed in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> when he and his companion were seized and <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. He was released at the end of three years and expelled the kingdom. Amongst other <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> who came to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> about this time were Father Archangel, "the Scotch Capuchin", who became the subject of a popular Italian biography, written by the <a href="09118a.htm">Papal Legate</a> <a href="13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a>, in which, however, the author's <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> played freely around historical fact; and Epiphanius Lindsay, described in the Memoir of P. Cyprien de Gamache as "son of the Count of Maine", but probably of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the Lindsays, lairds of Mains in Kirkcudbrightshire. But in 1630 the missionaries were withdrawn, when Henrietta Maria, Queen of Charles I, brought over twelve Capuchins as royal <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. Under the protection of the court, the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> publicly celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> and preached, sometimes holding controversies with the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and they are said to have made many conversions. Their mission, however, was abruptly terminated when Queen Henrietta went to <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> to solicit aid for the king against the Parliament. The royal <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> was closed, and the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> told to consider themselves <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a> in their own house. They were afterwards sent back to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. They returned at the Restoration of Charles II, but only for a few years. From this time no Capuchin seems to have come to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> until <a href="11240a.htm">Father Arthur O'Leary</a>, the brilliant <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> friar, settled in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, in 1789, ostensibly as <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Spanish Embassy, but really to minister to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, for whom he built St. Patrick's Church in Soho Square. He died in 1802. The present province of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> was not established until the latter end of the last century, through the instrumentality of Father Louis of Lavagna, an Italian friar, who came to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1850 with the intention of proceeding to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, but having arrived in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> he was induced to stay there and minister to the wants of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the district of Peckham. Here he built a small church, and at his request other <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were sent over to assist him. At this time the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> had virtually died out in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Only one Father of the Recollect Province founded in the time of <a href="09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> remained, and he ended his days a few years later in the house of the Capuchins at Pontypool, thus creating a link between the new <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> foundation and the old.</p>

<p>The order rapidly took root on English soil. Ten years after the coming of Father Louis of Lavagna the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> had four canonical communities at Peckham, Pantasaph, <a href="03649a.htm">Chester</a>, and Pontypool, besides several stations; during the next few years they established several houses in the <a href="14162b.htm">Diocese of Southwark</a>, so that in 1873 it was thought expedient to erect the English houses into a canonical province. The province is yet too young to afford much matter in the way of history of general interest; but it may be noted that in little more than half a century the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> have established thirty-five missions, most of which have been given over to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> when they were able to support a <a href="13675a.htm">secular priest</a>; besides the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> work thus entailed, they are continually employed in missionary labours outside their own <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In 1904 several <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of the province were sent to establish a house in Mendocino, <a href="03170a.htm">California</a>, which is to be the centre for missionary work in Mendocino county, now given into their charge by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>. They also have undertaken to supply missionaries for the <a href="01141d.htm">Vicariate of Aden</a> in <a href="01663a.htm">Arabia</a>. In 1905, at the request of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14162b.htm">Southwark</a>, the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> undertook a unique mission to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> hop-pickers. Every year in the month of September there is a large exodus of the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> poor into the hop-gardens of Kent; of these poor <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> average yearly about ten thousand. Until 1905 no provision was made for the spiritual needs of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> hop-pickers, and hardly any of them during the period of picking were able to hear Mass or receive the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Now each year when the hop-picking begins, Capuchin <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, assisted by <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> and lay workers, men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, go down to the hop-district. The work has distinctive characteristics. The majority of the hop-pickers are of the very poorest class, whence chiefly comes the leakage from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; they seldom enter a church, and often are lost to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in the shiftings and maze of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> life. In the Kentish hop-gardens they come again under the influence of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and religion. The work is as yet in its infancy, but it is big with possibilities for regaining to the Faith the indifferent and lapsed amongst our <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> poor; and it is characteristically <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> in its object and methods, for once again the friar is seen celebrating <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> and preaching in the open fields amongst the ill-clad and the hungry. In 1906 the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were able to restore one of the broken links in the history of English <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> by their return to <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, once glorified by the learning amidst poverty of the sons of the Poverello. On the outskirts of the city they have secured a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for the training of candidates for the order, whence they can look down upon Merton College, where, according to tradition, <a href="05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a> lectured, and upon the site of the ancient friary where the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="01212c.htm">Blessed Agnellus of Pisa</a> &#151; sent by St. Francis to establish the English province &#151; were enshrined until their dispersion in the reign of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>.</p>

<p>It was in 1615 that the first friar of the Capuchin reform came to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Father Stephen Daly. He was sent over by father Francis Nugent, whom in 1608, had received a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> commission to establish the reform in his native land. According to Bernardine of Colpetrazo, the other branches of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> had, in 1549, petitioned the general chapter of the Capuchins to send over <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> to introduce the reform into the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> houses of that country; but this was impossible, since at that time the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a> was still in force which forbade the Capuchin reform to establish houses outside <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Francis Nugent, the actual founder of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> province, was a remarkable man. He had already introduced the reform into the Rhine country when he petitioned the Roman authorities to set aside a house of the order for the reception of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>. Accordingly, the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Charleville, in the Low Countries, was given him for this purpose, and thither the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> from all provinces were sent to form a community whence the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> foundation might be begun. The <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Charleville thus became the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and alma mater of the province of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In 1615, first Stephen Daly and then four other <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were sent over. At first they lived separately wherever they could; but in 1623 or 1624 (the exact <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> seems uncertain) they took a house in Bridge Street, <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, where they lived in community. But in 1630 the house was seized by the Lords Justices and conferred upon the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. The <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, however, remained in the country, and were gradually reinforced in numbers: several of them suffered <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and banishment for the Faith. In 1642, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> mission numbered fifty-one <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, with houses in <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, Slane, <a href="09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, Mullingar, Drogheda, and <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>. In 1733 they had fourteen houses in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and two in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and were that year erected into a canonical province. Just then began one of the saddest periods in the history of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> people. Persecution and famine for a time seemed to break the spirit of the people; vocations became scarce, and the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> province became almost extinct. It lingered on, however. In 1771 <a href="11240a.htm">Father Arthur O'Leary</a> built a <a href="02781a.htm">church</a> in <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, and the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> reopened houses in <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a> and Kilkenny. The last days of the old province were made illustrious by the apostolic labours of the world-famous Father Theobald Mathew, the propagator of the temperance movement. After being for a while united with the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> under a commissary-general, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were again, in 1873, formed into a separate "custody", with autonomous government, and in 1885 the canonical province was re-established. There are now four <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of the order in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, with eighty- nine <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>. From the days of Father Mathew, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> have been to the front in forwarding the temperance movement initiated by him; but in October 1905, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> formally entrusted to them the preaching of a national crusade of temperance. Since then the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> are to be found in all parts of the country carrying out their mission.</p>

<p>On the American continent the Capuchins not only have flourishing missions in Central and south America, they have also two provinces in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> a missionary district in <a href="03170a.htm">California</a>, served by the English province, and missions in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, served by French <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>. The present establishment of the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> dates from 1857; but there were missionary Capuchins in the present territories of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> early in the seventeenth century. In 1632 <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of the province of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> were put in charge of the missions in <a href="01090a.htm">Acadia</a>. The centre of the mission was at Port Royal, now Annapolis, but it extended from Hancock County, in <a href="09541b.htm">Maine</a>, northwards, to the Bay of Chaleur. They seem also to have had missions in the Antilles, for in 1641 the friar, Father Pacifique, was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> there whilst on a visitation of the missions. The missions in Acadia were in a flourishing <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a> when the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="12581a.htm">Puritans</a> broke up the settlement in 1655 and expelled the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>. Yet in 1656 the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were still at work amongst the <a href="10283b.htm">Micmac Indians</a>. In 1714 <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> Capuchins were invited to undertake missions in Louisiana by the coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, de Mornay, himself a Capuchin Friar. They remained there until 1770, when for political reasons, Spanish <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> took the place of their French brethren. They had missions in <a href="11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, St. Louis, <a href="06372a.htm">Galveston</a>, <a href="10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, Pensacola, <a href="10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, <a href="10710a.htm">Natchitoches</a>, and other places. But in 1800 the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were withdrawn. In 1787 two German <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> were in charge of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> Church, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>But, as has been said, the present establishment of the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> dates from 1857; and its history is one of romantic incidents in the history of the reform. The chance visit of a young <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> from the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> to his native land, and his recital of the spiritual needs of America, inspired two <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> with the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of introducing the Capuchin Order into the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. They resigned their <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and, going out to America, were given Mt. Calvary, <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, as the site of a Capuchin <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>. At the express with of <a href="12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> these two <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> were then clothed with the religious habit and commissioned to lay the foundation of a new province. At the present day this province has houses at Mt. Calvary, <a href="10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, New York, <a href="02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, Appleton, and Yonkers. In New York they have four <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and three <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in Milwaukee; at Mt. Calvary they have a flourishing college, begun in 1864. Besides the province of Mt. Calvary, there is also the province of <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, established by <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> and <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalian</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>, driven from their native home by the <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>. The first house of this province was established at <a href="12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a> in 1874; but it was not till 1882 that the province became autonomous, at which time it had houses in Pittsburg, Herman, Pa.; Victoria, Kan.; Peoria, Metamora, Ill., and Cumberland, Md. The fathers of this province have introduced into the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> a charitable institution which has had remarkable success in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the Seraphisches Liebeswerk &#151; the "Seraphic Work of Charity". This <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> aims at assisting destitute <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children to obtain <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, by placing them in institutions or in private <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>. The centre of this work is at the Capuchin <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, <a href="12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, Pa.</p>

<p>In <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> Capuchins have houses in <a href="11352a.htm">Ottawa</a> and Quebec, and a missionary centre for work amongst the <a href="10283b.htm">Micmac Indians</a> at Sainte-Anne de Restigouche. The work carried on here is reminiscent of the heroic days of the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> mission. From the mission centre the fathers make missionary tours amongst the scattered Indians. The <a href="10283b.htm">Micmac</a> number about four thousand; they are much attached to their religion and language, and show no signs of decay.</p>

<p>Amongst Capuchins of note who have laboured in North America, mention must be made of Ignazio Persico, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13488a.htm">Savannah</a> from 1870 till 1872, and afterwards <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Another <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> still living, Cardinal Vives y Tuto, took his <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> as a Capuchin Friar at Santa Clara College, <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, in 1872, and was for a time a member of the community at <a href="10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>. Nor may we omit the name of Bishop Charbonel, who resigned the <a href="14781d.htm">See of Toronto</a> to take the Capuchin habit. It was he who invited the saintly friar, Louis of Lavagna, founder of the present English province, to take up missionary work in Toronto in 1856. The friar only lived nine months after reaching Toronto, drying on 17 March, 1857; yet during that short period he had gained the reputation of a saint.</p>

<p>Thus are the Capuchins, together with their brethren of the other <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, taking up again in English-speaking lands the traditions of past centuries with renewed vigour. The troubles of the past may have purified, they have not broken, the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> spirit.</p>

<p>By way of distinction from other religious, the Capuchin Friars in most countries append the "O.M. Cap."(Ordinis Minorum, Capuccinorum) after their names; but in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> they sign "O.S.F.C." (Ordinis Sancti Francisci, Capuccinorum) in accordance with the use of the ancient English province.</p>
