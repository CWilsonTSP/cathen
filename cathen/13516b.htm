<p>(Gr. <em>sk&eacute;psis</em>, speculation, <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>; <em>sk&eacute;ptesthai,</em> to scrutinize or examine carefully) may mean (1) <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> based on rational grounds, or (2) disbelief based on rational grounds (cf. Balfour, "Defence of Phil. Doubt", p. 296), or (3) a denial of the possibility of attaining <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>; and in any of these senses it may extend to all spheres of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (Universal Scepticism), or to some particular spheres of the same (Mitigated Scepticism). The third is the strictly <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> sense of the term Scepticism, which is taken, unless otherwise specified, to be universal. Scepticism is then a systematic denial of the capacity of the human <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> anything whatsoever with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>. It differs from <a href="01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> because the latter denies only the possibility of <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> and natural <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>; from Positivism in that Positivism denies that we do <em>de facto</em> <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> anything beyond the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> by which phenomena are related to one another; from <a href="02040a.htm">Atheism</a> in that the atheist denies only the fact of <a href="06608b.htm">God's existence</a>, not our capacity for knowing whether He exists.</p>

<h2>History of scepticism</h2>

<p>The great <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> of the East are for the most part essentially sceptical. They treat life as one vast illusion, destined some time or other to give place to a state of nescience, or to be absorbed in the life of the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a>. But their Scepticism is a tone of mind rather than a reasoned <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> based upon a critical examination of the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> or upon a study of the history of human speculation. If we wish for the latter we must seek it among the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophies</a> of ancient <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a>. Among the Greeks the earliest form of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculation was directed towards an explanation of natural phenomena, and the contradictory theories which were soon evolved by the prolific genius of the Greek mind, inevitably led to Scepticism. Heraclitus, Parmenides, Democritus, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, though differing on other points, one and all came to the conclusion that the senses, whence they had derived the data upon which their theories were built, could not be trusted. Accordingly Protagoras and the <a href="14145c.htm">Sophists</a> distinguish "appearances" from "reality"; but, finding that no two <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> could agree as to the nature of the latter, they pronounced reality unknowable. The thorough-going Scepticism which resulted is apparent in the three famous propositions of Gorgias: "Nothing exists"; "If anything did exist it could not be known"; "If it was known, the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it would be incommunicable."</p>

<p>The first step towards the refutation of this Scepticism was the <a href="14119a.htm">Socratic</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the concept. There can be no <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of the particular, said <a href="14119a.htm">Socrates</a>. Hence, before any <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> at all is possible, we must clear up our general notions of things and come to some agreement in regard to definitions. <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a>, adopting this attitude, but still holding to the view that the senses can give only <em>d&oacute;xa</em> (opinion) and not <em>epist&eacute;me</em> (<a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>), worked out an <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> theory of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>. <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, who followed, rejected <a href="12159a.htm">Plato's</a> theory, and proposed a very different one in its place, with the result that another epidemic of Scepticism succeeded. But <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> did more than this. He propounded the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> or self-evident <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. All things cannot be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>, he said; yet an <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> regress is impossible. Hence there must be somewhere self-evident principles which are no mere assumptions, but which underlie the structure of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and are presupposed by the very nature of things (Metaph., 1005 b, 1006 a). This <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, later on, was to prove one of the chief forces that checked the destructive onslaught of the Sceptics; for, even if <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> dictum cannot be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>, it none the less states a fact which to many is itself self-evident. It was the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoics</a> who first took "evidence" as the ultimate criterion of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. Perceptions, they taught, are valid when they are characterized by <em>en&aacute;rgeia,</em> i.e. when their objects are manifest, clear, or obvious. Similarly conceptions and judgments are valid when we are conscious that in them there is <em>kat&aacute;lepsis</em> an apprehension of reality. Contemporaneously, however, with <a href="15756b.htm">Zeno</a>, the founder of <a href="14299a.htm">Stoicism</a>, lived <a href="12587a.htm">Pyrrho the Sceptic</a> (d. about 270 B.C.), who, though he admitted that we can <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> "appearance," denied that we can <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> anything of the reality that underlies it. <em>Oud&egrave;n m&acirc;llon</em> &#151; nothing is more one thing than another. Contradictory statements, therefore, may both be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>. A scepticism so radical as this, the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoics</a> argued, is useless for practical life; and this argument bore fruit. Arcesilaus, founder of the Middle Academy (third century B.C.), though rejecting the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoic</a> criterion and affirming that nothing could be known for certain, nevertheless admitted that some criterion is needed whereby to direct our actions in practice, and with this in view suggested that we should assent to what is reasonable <em>(t&ograve; e&uacute;logon).</em> For "the reasonable" Carneades, who founded the Third Academy (second century B.C.), substituted "the probable": propositions which after careful examination manifest no contradiction, external or internal, are <em>pithan&eacute;</em> (probable) <em>ka&agrave; aper&iacute;statos</em> (secure) <em>ka&igrave; perideum&eacute;ne</em> (thoroughly tested) (Sextus Empiricus "Adv. Math.", VII, 166). A subsequent attempt to reconcile conflicting doctrines having <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> futile, however, the Academy lapsed into <a href="12587a.htm">Pyrrhonism</a>. &AElig;nesidemus sums up the traditional arguments of the Sceptics under ten heads, which later on (second century A.D.) were reduced by Sextus Empiricus to five:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>human judgments and human theories are contradictory;</li><li>all <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> involves an <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> regress;</li><li>perceptual data are relative both to the percipient and to one another;</li><li>axioms, or self-evident <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a>, are really assumptions;</li><li>all syllogistic reasoning involves <em>di&aacute;llelos</em> (a vicious circle), for the major premise can be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> only by complete induction, and the possibility of complete induction supposes the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of the conclusion (Sextus Emp., "Hyp. Pyrrh.", I, 164; II, 134; Diogenes Laertius, IX, 88).</li></ol></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From Scepticism the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a> sought refuge in the immediacy of a mystic experience; <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a> and <a href="01546a.htm">Anselm</a> in <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> which in <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> matters must precede both experience and <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (cf. Augustine, "De vera relig.", xxiv, xxv; "De util. cred.", ix; Anselm, "De fid. Trin.", ii); <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> in a rational, coherent, and systematic theory of the ultimate nature of things, based on self-evident <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> but consistent also with the facts of experience, and consistent too with the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of revelation, which thus serves to confirm what we have already discovered by the light of natural reason. But with the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, characterized as it was by an indiscriminate enthusiasm for all forms of Greek thought, it was only natural that the Scepticism of the Greeks should be revived. In this movement Montaigne (d. 1592), Charron (d. 1603), Sanchez (d. 1632), <a href="11511a.htm">Pascal</a> (d. 1662), Sorbi&egrave;re (d. 1670), Le Vayer (d. 1672), Hirnhaym (d. 1679), Foucher (d. 1696), Bayle (d. 1706), Huet (d. 1721), all took part. Its aim was to discredit <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> on the old grounds of contradiction and of the impossibility of proving anything. Huet, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranches, and others sought to argue from the bankruptcy of reason to the necessity and sufficiency of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. But for the most part, <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, understood in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense of <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in a system of revealed doctrines capable of intelligent expression and rational interpretation, so far from being exempt from the attacks of the Sceptics, was rather (as it still is) the chief object against which their efforts were directed. Faith, as they understood it, was blind and unreasoning. The diversity of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> introduced by <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> had rendered all other <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, in their view no less contradictory than philosophy and natural <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="05407a.htm#hume">Hume</a> Scepticism finds a new argument derived from the <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> of <a href="05407a.htm#locke">Locke</a>. A critical examination of human cognition, it was said, reveals the fact that the data of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> consist merely of impressions &#151; distinct, successive, discreet. These the mind connects in various ways, and these ways of connecting things become habitual. Thus the principle of <a href="03459a.htm">causality</a>, the propositions of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra, physical <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> etc., in short all forms of synthesis and relations are subjective in origin. They have no objective validity, and their alleged "necessity" is but a <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> feeling arising from the force of habit. We undoubtedly <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in real things and real causes; but this is merely because we have grown accustomed so to group and connect our <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> impressions. The arguments of <a href="12587a.htm">Pyrrho</a> and other Sceptics are unanswerable, their Scepticism reasonable and well-founded; but in practical life it is too much trouble to think otherwise than we do think, and we could not get on if we did. <a href="08603a.htm">Kant's</a> answer to Hume was embodied in a philosophy as eminently subjective as that of Hume himself. Consequently it failed, and resulted only in further Scepticism, implicit, if not actually professed. And nowadays physical <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, which in <a href="08603a.htm">Kant's</a> time alone held its own against the inroads of Scepticism, is as thoroughly permeated with it as the rest of our <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. One instance must suffice &#151; that of Mr. A. J. Balfour, who in his "Defense of Philosophic Doubt" seeks to uphold religious <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> on the equivocal ground that it is no less certain than scientific theory and method. There is, he says,</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>no satisfactory means of inferring the general from the particular (c. ii),</li><li>no empirical <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="03459a.htm">causality</a> (c. iii),</li><li>no adequate guarantee of the uniformity of nature and the persistence of physical law (cc. iv, v).</li></ul></div>

<p>Again, of the popular philosophic arguments which are "put forward as final and conclusive grounds of <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>" p. 138), the argument from general consent is not ultimate; that from success in practice, though it gives us grounds for confidence in the future, cannot be conclusive, since it is empirical in character; whilst the argument from common sense which affirms that the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, when working normally, is trustworthy, involves a vicious circle, since normal workings can be distinguished from abnormal only on the ground that they lead to <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> (c. vii). Similarly the original "deliverances of consciousness", to which Scottish Intuitionists appeal, are of no avail because it is impossible to determine what deliverances of consciousness are original and what are not. Returning to the question of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, Mr. Balfour finds that it contradicts common sense in that (e.g.) it declares bodies, which appear coloured to our senses, to be made up in reality of uncoloured particles, and, while thus discrediting the trustworthiness of observation, provides no criterion whereby to distinguish observations which are trustworthy from those which are not. Its method, too, is inconclusive, for there may always be other hypotheses which would explain the facts equally well (c. xii). Lastly the evolution of <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> tends wholly to discredit its validity, for our <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a> are largely determined by non-rational causes, and, even when evidence is their motive, what we regard as evidence is settled by circumstances altogether beyond our control (c. xiii).</p>

<h2>Critical examination of scepticism</h2>

<p>A reply to the copious arguments of the Sceptic enumerated above, might take the following line:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>The Sceptic fails to distinguish between practical moral <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> which excludes <em>all reasonable</em> grounds for <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and absolute <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> which excludes <em>all possible</em> grounds for <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>. The latter can be had only when evidence is complete, <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> wholly adequate, obvious, and conclusive, and when all difficulties and objections can be completely solved. In mathematics this is sometimes possible, though not always; but in other matters "practical <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>" as a rule is all we can get. And this is sufficient, since "practical <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>" is <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> for reasonable beings.</li><li>Axiomatic, or self-evident, <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> must be insisted on. The <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of an axiom can never be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>, yet may become manifest, even to those who for the time being <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> it, when its meaning and its application are clearly understood.</li><li>Perceptual judgments refer qualities (not sensations) to things, but they do not declare what is the nature of these qualities, and hence do not contradict scientific theory.</li><li>Perception is trustworthy in that it reveals to us the <em>general</em> character and behaviour of things &#151; both of ourselves and of external objects. We do not often mistake a spade for a table-knife or a turkey for a hippopotamus. The senses do not pretend to be accurate in detail (unless assisted by instruments) or in abnormal circumstances.</li><li>The "normal" working of our faculties can be determined independently of any question as to the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of their deliverances. The work of our faculties is "normal", (1) when they are free from the influence of subjective factors, other than those which belong to their proper nature (i.e. free from disease, impediment, the influence of prejudice, expectancy desire, etc.), and (2) when they are exercised upon their own proper objects. In the case of the senses this means upon objects we meet with day by day under ordinary circumstances. If the circumstances are extraordinary, our senses are still trustworthy, however, provided the circumstances be taken into account.</li><li>Alleged contradictions inherent in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> terms are due to ambiguity, misunderstanding, the lack of precise definition, or the influence of a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> philosophy. For instance, the contradictions which Mr. Bradley points out (Appearance and Reality, bk. I) in terms such as time, space, <a href="14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="01096c.htm">accident</a>, <a href="03459a.htm">causality</a>, self, are not to be found in these terms as defined by the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>.</li><li>Contradictions between different <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> theories may be (a) accounted for, and (b) eliminated. (a) They arise from ambiguity, variety of definition, misconception, misinterpretation, careless inference, groundless assumption, unverified hypothesis, and the neglect of relevant facts. Yet (b) all <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> contains an element of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and contradictions suppose a common principle already granted anterior to their divergence; and these underlying principles and elements of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in all theories can be distinguished from the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> in which they are wrapped up.</li><li>Beliefs arising from non-rational or from unknown grounds should either be re-established on rational grounds or discarded. All <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a> should be evident either (1) immediately, as in the case (e.g.) of our <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in external reality, or (2) mediately by inference from known <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, or (3) on the ground of adequate testimony.</li><li>The Sceptic assumes the capacity of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> to criticize the faculty of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and thus, in so far as he denies its capacity to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> anything, implicitly contradicts himself. </li></ul></div>
