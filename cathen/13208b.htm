<p>(ROTHOMAGENSIS)</p>

<p>Revived by the Concordat of 1802 with the Sees of <a href="02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>, <a href="05671a.htm">Evreux</a>, and S&eacute;ez as suffragans: it also includes the Department of the Seine Inferieure. The Archdiocese of Rouen was curtailed in 1802 by giving the Archdeanery of Pontoise to the <a href="15366a.htm">Diocese of Versailles</a>; the Deaneries of Pont Audemer and Bourgtheroulde, and a part of the Deanery of P&eacute;rier, to the <a href="05671a.htm">Diocese of Evreux</a>; several <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the Deanery of Aumale were annexed to the <a href="02377c.htm">Diocese of Beauvais</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Rouen bears the title of <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Normandy. Rouen, chief city of the <em>Secunda Provincia Lugdunensis</em> under Constantine, and later of Neustria, has been since 912 the capital of <a href="11104a.htm">Normandy</a> and residence of the dukes.</p>

<p>The episcopal catalogues of the ninth and tenth centuries and the "Liber Eburneus" of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Rouen, which extends to 1068, indicate St. Mellon as first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rouen; the "Liber Niger" of <a href="11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a> which comes down to 1079 and the episcopal lists <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the twelfth century mention the episcopate of a certain Nicasius (Nicaise) as antedating that of St. Mellon. The legend of this Nicaise, based on Hilduin, makes him and his two companions, Quirinus and Scubiculus, disciples of St. Denis who came from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to Normandy but suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at their arrival on the banks of the river Epte. It was under the episcopate of William (Bonne Ame) the Good (1079-1110) that the name of Nicaise was placed at the head of the episcopal lists of Rouen. A number of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> were the successors of St. Mellon; according to the <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a> of the Abb&eacute; Sauvage they were: St. Avitianus (about 314); St. Severus; St. Victricius, born about 330, a soldier in the beginning of his career and as such a confessor of the Faith under <a href="08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>; made <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rouen about 380 and died, according to his biographer, Abb&eacute; Vacandard, before 409; famous for his friendship with <a href="11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a> and St. Martin, also for going in 396 to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> where he worked <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the conversion of the English people; his treatise "De Laude Sanctorum" is a strong plea in favour of the devotion to <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>; <a href="08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> commissioned him in 404 to make known in Gaul the "Liber Regularum", which contains urgent instructions for <a href="03481a.htm">ecclesiastical celibacy</a>, for the respect due to the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and Roman supremacy; St. Innocent; St. Evodius (about 430); St. Goldardus (490-525), brother of <a href="10115b.htm">St. Medardus</a>, one of the assistants at the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a>; St. Flavius; St. Pretextatus (550-586), exiled in 577 by order of King Chilperic, was reinstated in the diocese in 584, and stabbed before the altar in 586 by order of Fredegonde; <a href="13163a.htm">St. Romanus</a> (631-641) former chancellor of Clotaire II; legend relates how he delivered the environs of Rouen from a monster called Gargouille, having had him captured by a liberated <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in commemoration of St. Romain in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Rouen were granted the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to set a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> free on the day that the <a href="12762a.htm">reliquary</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> was carried in <a href="12446c.htm">procession</a>; <a href="11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a> (Audoennus) (641-684), previous to his appointment as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was chancellor of Dagobert, and wrote a life of St. Eloy (Eligius); his episcopate was distinguished by the foundation of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Fontenelle, Jumi&egrave;ges, and F&eacute;camp, by the unceasing efforts he made to exterminate all traces of <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> in his <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and by the arbitration effected through his influence between Austrasia and Neustria; his fame as a <a href="10350a.htm">miracle-worker</a> was great in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; St. Ansbert (684-92 or 93) chancellor of Clotaire III, and afterwards confined for political reasons by Pepin of Heristal in the Abbey of Hautmont; recently there was found in the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of Carlsruhe a curious little poem of the seventh century written by him on <a href="11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a>; this poem came originally from the Abbey of <a href="12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>; <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> (722-30) was a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of Jumi&egrave;ges before being made <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; he subsequently combined the Sees of Rouen, <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bayeux, also the <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of <a href="08566a.htm">Jumi&egrave;ges</a> and <a href="06129a.htm">Fontenelle</a>; St. Remi (755-772), brother of King Pepin, was also <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Rouen.</p>

<p>Guntbaldus who had played a certain part in the restoration of Louis the Pious, having become <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rouen, was commissioned in 846 by <a href="13728c.htm">Sergius II</a> to settle a dispute between Ebbo and <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a>, and died in 849. The name of a certain St. Leo who suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="02360b.htm">Bayonne</a> sometimes appears incorrectly on the lists of <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Rouen at the end of the ninth century and should be struck off. Among the more famous <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Rouen were: Archbishop Franco (911-19), who <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> the <a href="11115b.htm">Northman</a> chief Rollo; St. Maurille (1055-67), who reformed his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and fought the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>; John of <a href="02358b.htm">Bayeux</a> (1069-79), whose book on <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> services regulated religious devotions in Normandy; William I (Bonne Ame) (1071-1119), first a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and allowed <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> to leave the Abbey of Bec to occupy the <a href="03299b.htm">See of Canterbury</a>; Hugh of <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a> (1130-74), author of numerous <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works; under his episcopate Rouen was <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> in May, 1131, by a visit from Innocent II, the only <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> who ever entered Normandy; Gautier de Coutances called the Magnificent (1184-1207) the favourite companion of <a href="13041b.htm">Richard the Lion Hearted</a>; Eudes II Rigaud (1247-1274), one of the most eminent statesmen of the day; he accompanied St. Louis on his <a href="15088a.htm">Tunis</a> <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> and left a diary of his pastoral visitations which has the most important bearing on the <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of the province; Gilles Aycelin (1311-18), Chancellor of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; Pierre Roger (1330-39) became <a href="04023a.htm">Pope Clement VI</a>; Peter de la Foret (1352-56) was at first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and became a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1356 as Chancellor of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> he was one of the most faithful adherents of the dauphin, afterwards Charles V.</p>

<p>During the Hundred Years War the English occupied Rouen from 1417-1449; the Duke of Bedford at his own request was formally made a member of the Chapter of Rouen in 1430. The English rule, so severe for the people, increased the privileges of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> but dealt rigorously with such <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> as were thought rebellious; especially with Archbishop Louis de Harcourt who was deprived in 1421 of his possessions for refusing to pay homage to Henry V. The following should be added to the list of <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>: John of la Rochetaill&eacute;e (1423-29), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1426; Louis of Luxembourg (1436-42), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1439, was the sworn agent in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> of Henry VI, King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; William of Estouteville (1453-83), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1437 and commissioned by <a href="11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> in 1453 to mediate between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and to obtain from Charles VII certain modifications of the <a href="12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a>; Robert of Croismare (1483-93) and Cardinal Georges d'Amboise (1493-1510), both of whom played an important part in the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> movement; the two Cardinals Charles of Bourbon (1550-90 and 1590-94), the first of whom was at one time a candidate for the throne of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; <a href="08530c.htm">Fran&ccedil;ois, Cardinal de Joyeuse</a> (1604-15) who negotiated peace in the name of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> between <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a> and the <a href="15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a>; the two Fran&ccedil;ois de Harlay (1615-51) and (1651-71); <a href="04096a.htm#II">John Nicholas Colbert</a> (1691-1707), son of the minister; Nicholas de Saulx Tavannes (1733-59), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1756; Dominic de la Rochefoucauld (1759-1800), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1778, president of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> at the States General, <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> after 10 August, 1792, and died in exile at <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>; Etienne Hubert de Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s (1802-18) brother of the archchancellor of <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1803; Prince de Croy (1823-44), chief almoner of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> under the Restoration, and <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1825; <a href="02674b.htm">Henry de Bonnechose</a> (1858-83), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1863; L&eacute;on Thomas (1884-94), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1893; William Sourrieu (1894-99), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1897.</p>

<p>It is not known exactly whether Rouen became a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> at the time of St. Victricius or under Bishop Grimo, who in 744 received the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="15743b.htm">Pope Zachary</a>; in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it exercised <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> over Evreux, Avranches, <a href="13681d.htm">S&eacute;ez</a>, <a href="02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>, Lisieux, and <a href="04455b.htm">Coutances</a>.

In vain did Gebuin, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, obtain from <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> two <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> in 1070 which recognized his primacy over Rouen; they remained unexecuted as well as a similar <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="03478a.htm">Celestine II</a> given in 1144. On 12 November, 1455, Cardinal Dominic Capranica, <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate, recognized the independence of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Rouen by giving a definite decision, confirmed in 1457 and 1458 by two <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="03187a.htm">Callistus III</a>. The <a href="01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Rouen was known as the "grand archidiacre de la chr&eacute;tient&eacute;". The Chapter, in virtue of a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> from <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> in 1371, was completely exempt from the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> both spiritual and temporal. <a href="11296a.htm">Nicholas Oresme</a> (died 1382) was head master of the College of Navarre and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lisieux; he translated <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and was dean of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Rouen; the famous Peter d'Ailly and the historian Thomas Basin, later <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lisieux belonged to the Chapter of Rouen. St. Remy, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rouen, was after Chrodigang, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, the principal initiator in the reform which under Pepin replaced the Gallican with the Roman liturgy. In 1729 the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Rouen accepted the breviary of Urbain Robinet, <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of Rouen, who revised the liturgy in a Gallican sense. Later <a href="02674b.htm">Cardinal Bonnechose</a> insisted on the use of the Roman liturgy in the diocese. The Chapter of Rouen preserved the custom until the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> of chanting the Office by heart; it was forbidden even to bring a book into the choir. The faculty of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of Rouen was founded in 1808 and organized in 1809; it was however suppressed in 1885.</p>

<p>No town of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> has produced such marvels of <a href="05257a.htm">religious architecture</a> as Rouen. The oldest part of the Cathedral, which has survived all fires, is the <a href="02394d.htm">belfry</a> of <a href="13163a.htm">St. Romanus's</a> tower, which dates from about 1160; the construction of the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> began about 1200; the Calende portal, so called from an imaginary animal, and the portals of the <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a>, famous for the richness of their ornamentation, were finished in the first quarter of the fourteenth century. The Butter Tower (<em>la Tour de Beurre</em>), so called because it was built with the <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> derived from the <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, dates from the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century, and is one of the most famous edifices in the flamboyant style. The ninety-six choir stalls were carved in the fifteenth century under the direction of Philippot Viart and represent in their workmanship all the professions of the period. There are three celebrated <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> preserved in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; one, whether correctly or not, is said to be the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Archbishop Maurille, and dates from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; that of the two <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> d'Amboise dates from 1520 to 1525 and on it is the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of George d'Amboise, the work of Jean Goujon; that of Louis de Br&eacute;z&eacute;, attributed in part to Jean Goujon, was executed from 1535 to 1544 at the expense of Diane de Poitiers, <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of Louis de Br&eacute;z&eacute;. The present Church of St. Ouen, where a small Roman <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> is still preserved and some bases of Roman pillars <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the eleventh century, is one of the rare examples that exists in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> of a large and beautiful church of the fourteenth century, almost complete, and one of the most delicate pieces of architecture extant. The Church of St. Maclou dates from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; the folding doors are attributed to Jean Goujon. On one side of the church is a monument unique in its way, the <em>aitre St. Maclou.</em> The word <em>aitre</em> is derived from <em>Atrium. L'aitre St. Maclou,</em> the old cemetery of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, is a large rectangular space surrounded by porticoes built in 1526-40, and shows the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style in all its purity. A <a href="04617a.htm">Dance of Death</a> (<em>Danse Macabre</em>) sculptured on its columns was unfortunately badly defaced by the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>. The Palace of Justice in Rouen is one of the most celebrated buildings belonging to the end of the Gothic period.</p>

<p>Among the twelve <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> for men which the Diocese of Rouen possessed under the old regime must be mentioned, besides Fontenelle and Jumi&egrave;ges, the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of <a href="11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a> de Rouen, founded in 548, where a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> flourished which was recognized by <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in 1238; and the Abbey of F&eacute;camp, dedicated to the Trinity in 658 by St. Waningus (Vaning), Governor of Neustria and Count of the Palace under Clovis II. This was first occupied by <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> under the direction of St. Hildemarche, was ruined by the Normans in 841, and reopened for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> by Richard, first Duke of Normandy, who had the present beautiful church dedicated in 990. St. William (1001-28) was the first <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of F&eacute;camp; he had among his successors the future <a href="04023a.htm">Pope Clement VI</a> and Jean Casimir, King of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, who, after abdicating his throne, became <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of F&eacute;camp in 1669. The Abbey of St. George de Boscherville was founded in 1060 by Raoul de Tancarville, chamberlain of William the Conqueror. The abbey of Tr&eacute;port was founded in 1056-59 by Robert, Count d'Eu, companion of William the Conqueror. During the religious <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> committed great ravages in Rouen; having become masters of the city 16 April, 1562, they devastated <a href="11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a>, made a pyre in the centre of the church with the stalls and fragments of the superb screen, and then burnt the body of <a href="11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a> and other <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the basilica. Rouen was retaken 26 October, 1562, by Fran&ccedil;ois de <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> and Antoine* de Bourbon; the majority of Charles IX was proclaimed there in 1563. Rouen, which had declared for the League, was ineffectually besieged by <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> from December, 1591, to April, 1592, and only surrendered in 1594 to the new Bourbon king.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the eleventh century an association of distinguished men was founded at Rouen in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Immaculate Conception. Its chief or president was called "prince". In 1486 Pierre Dar&eacute;, lieutenant-general of the bailiwick of Rouen, was "prince" and converted the association into a literary <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> which awarded a prize for the best poems written on the Immaculate Conception. Every stanza of the poems, according to a special rule, must end with the same verse as the first; this repeated verse, which they called "palinodie", gave the name of "Palinod" to the confraternity. <a href="09569b.htm">Malherbe</a> took the prize in 1555; <a href="04374b.htm">Pierre Corneille</a> competed in 1633, but does not seem to have been <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a>; Jacqueline Pascal received the prize in 1640; Thomas Corneille in 1641. The three-volume Bible, finished at the end of the twelfth century for the Chapter of Rouen, is one of the finest specimens of calligraphy of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. A copy of the "Chroniquesde Normandie", made at Rouen about 1450 for the aldermen and given to <a href="04096a.htm">Colbert</a> in 1682 for the royal <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>, is illustrated with ten miniatures which are among the most beautiful productions of the fifteenth century., The finest copy extant of the "Chroniquesde Monstrelet" was made at Rouen and contains drawings of the greatest importance for the history of the fifteenth century. The <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, written in the sixteenth century by order of Cardinal George d'Amboise, who brought back with him the most beautiful <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> from the royal <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, compare favourably with those of the best Italian masters.</p>

<p>Besides those already mentioned, many <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> are connected with the history of the Diocese of Rouen or are the objects there of special devotion: St. Severus (sixth century) who perhaps was the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranches and whose <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Rouen; St. Austreberta, <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> (seventh century); St. Sidonius, of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> origin (seventh century); the <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> St. Clair, of Vexin, <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> of the ninth century; <a href="09091b.htm">St. Lawrence O'Toole</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, died at Eu in the diocese 1180; <a href="08409c.htm">Blessed Joan of Arc</a> was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Rouen in the tower constructed in 1206 by <a href="12001a.htm">King Philip Augustus</a>, and was burned in the old market place 31 May, 1431, after her so-called <a href="01044d.htm">abjuration</a> at the cemetery of <a href="11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a>; <a href="08444a.htm">St. John Baptist de la Salle</a>, who established the first <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> at St. Yon near Rouen in 1705 and died at Rouen in 1719. The <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> given to the diocese by Fontenelle and Jumi&egrave;ges must also be mentioned. The <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> of Fontenelle are: the founder, St. Wandrille (Wandregesilus) (570-667); the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> St. Bain (about 729), St. Wando (742-756); St. Gerbold (died 806); <a href="01545c.htm">St. Ansegisus</a> (823-833), who compiled the capitularies or <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and Louis the Pious; St. Gerard (1008-31); and the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> St. Gond (died about 690); St. Erembert, who became, about 657, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>; <a href="15716a.htm">St. Wulfram</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13716a.htm">Sens</a> and apostle of the Frisians (died in 720); St. Agatho; St. D&eacute;sir&eacute;; St. Sindoard; St. Cond&eacute; (second half of the seventh century); St. Erbland or Hermeland, who died in 715 after founding the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Hindre (Indret) in the <a href="10681a.htm">Diocese of Nantes</a>; St. Erinhard (died 739); St. Hardouin (died 811).

Before the Law of 1901 directed against the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, there were in the Diocese of Rouen, <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Picpusiens, <a href="07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a> and of the Sacred Heart of Mary, and <a href="08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>.
