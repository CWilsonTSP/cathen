<p><a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Virgin, born 2 April, 1566; died 25 May, 1607. Of outward events there were very few in the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> life. She came of two noble <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>, her father being Camillo Geri de' Pazzi and her mother a Buondelmonti. She was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and named Caterina, in the great <a href="02276b.htm">baptistery</a>. Her childhood much resembled that of some other <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> who have become great mystics, in an early <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance, great charity to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, an apostolic spirit of teaching religious <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a>, and a charm and sweetness of nature that made her a general favourite. But above all other spiritual characteristics was Caterina's intense attraction towards the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, her longing to receive It, and her delight in touching and being near those who were speaking of It, or who had just been to <a href="07402a.htm">Communion</a>. She made her own First Communion at the age of ten, and shortly afterwards vowed her virginity to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. At fourteen she was sent to <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Cavalaresse, where she lived in so <a href="10578b.htm">mortified</a> and fervent a manner as to make the sisters prophesy that she would become a great saint; and, on leaving it, she told her <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> of her resolve to enter the religious state. They were truly spiritual people; and, after a little difficulty in persuading them to relinquish their only daughter, she finally entered in December, 1582, the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> degl' Angeli, founded by four <a href="06105c.htm">Florentine</a> ladies in 1450 and renowned for its strict observance. Her chief reason for choosing this <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was the rule there followed of <a href="06278a.htm">daily Communion</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Caterina was clothed in 1583, when she took the name of Maria Maddalena; and on 29 May, 1584, being then so ill that they feared she would not recover, she was <a href="12451b.htm">professed</a>. After her profession, she was subject to an extraordinary daily <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> for forty consecutive days, at the end of which time she appeared at the point of death. She recovered, however, <a href="10338a.htm">miraculously</a>; and henceforth, in spite of constant bad health, was able to fill with energy the various offices to which she was appointed. She became, in turn, mistress of externs--i.e. of girls coming to the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> on trial--teacher and mistress of the juniors, <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> mistress (which post she held for six years), and finally, in 1604, superior. For five years (1585-90) <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> allowed her to be tried by terrible inward desolation and <a href="14504a.htm">temptations</a>, and by external diabolic attacks; but the <a href="06147a.htm">courageous</a> severity and deep <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> of the means that she took for overcoming these only served to make her virtues shine more brilliantly in the eyes of her community.</p>

<p>From the time of her clothing with the religious habit till her death the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> life was one series of raptures and <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasies</a>, of which only the most notable characteristics can be named in a short notice.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>First, these raptures sometimes seized upon her whole being with such force as to compel her to rapid motion (e.g. towards some sacred object).</li><li>Secondly, she was frequently able, whilst in <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, to carry on work belonging to her office--e.g., <a href="05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a>, etc.--with perfect composure and efficiency.</li><li>Thirdly--and this is the point of chief importance--it was whilst in her states of rapture that St. Mary Magdalen de' Pazzi gave utterance to those wonderful maxims of Divine Love, and those counsels of perfection for <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, especially in the religious state, which a modern editor of a selection of them declares to be "more frequently quoted by spiritual writers than those even of <a href="14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a>". These utterances have been preserved to us by the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> companions, who (unknown to her) took them down from her lips as she poured them forth. She spoke sometimes as of herself, and sometimes as the mouthpiece of one or other of the Persons of the <a href="15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>. These maxims of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> are sometimes described as her "Works", although she wrote down none of them herself. </li></ul></div>

<p>This <a href="05277a.htm">ecstatic</a> life in no wise interfered with the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> usefulness in her community. She was noted for her strong common-sense, as well as for the high standard and strictness of her government, and was most dearly <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> to the end of her life by all for the spirit of intense charity that accompanied her somewhat severe code of discipline. As novice-mistress she was renowned for a <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> gift of reading her subjects' hearts--which gift, indeed, was not entirely confined to her community. Many <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>, both of this and of other kinds, she performed for the benefit either of her own <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> or of outsiders. She often saw things far off, and is said once to have supernaturally beheld <a href="03444a.htm">St. Catherine de' Ricci</a> in her <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="12117a.htm">Prato</a>, reading a letter that she had sent her and writing the answer; but the two <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> never met in a natural manner. To St. Mary Magdalen's numerous penances, and to the ardent <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of suffering that made her genuinely wish to live long in order to suffer with Christ, we can here merely refer; but it must not be forgotten that she was one of the strongest upholders of the value of suffering for the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our fellow-creatures, that ever lived. Her death was fully in accordance with her life in this respect, for she died after an illness of nearly three years' duration and of indescribable painfulness, borne with heroic <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> to the end. Innumerable <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> followed the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> death, and the process for her <a href="02364b.htm">beatification</a> was begun in 1610 under <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, and finished under <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1626. She was not, however, <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> till sixty-two years after her death, when <a href="04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> raised her to the altars in 28 April, 1669. Her <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 27 May.</p>
