<p>"Catechumen," in the early <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, was the name applied to one who had not yet been initiated into the <a href="13295a.htm">sacred mysteries</a>, but was undergoing a course of preparation for that purpose. The word occurs in <a href="../bible/gal006.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>: "Let him that is instructed in the word, [<em>ho katechoumenos, is qui catechizatur</em>] communicate to him that instructeth him [<em>to katechounti</em>, <em>ei qui catechizat</em>] in all good things." Other parts of the verb <em>katicksein</em> occur in <a href="../bible/1co014.htm#vrs19">1 Corinthians 14:19</a>; <a href="../bible/luk001.htm">Luke 1:4</a>; <a href="../bible/act018.htm">Acts 18:24</a>.</p>

<p>I. As the acceptance of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> involved <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in a body of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and the observance of the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a> ("teach, make disciples, scholars of them"; "teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you", <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs20">Matthew 28:20</a>), it is clear that some sort of preliminary instruction must have been given to the converts. In Apostolic times this would vary according as these were <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>, and was naturally simple in character and short in duration. When, however, the churches came to be organized, the instruction and probation would be longer and more elaborate. Thus, as early as the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the Epistle to the Galatians (56-57?) we meet with the mention of catechist and catechumen; but we cannot infer from this that the full regulations were already in force. It was rather the danger of apostasy, or even betrayal in time of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> which gave rise to special precautions as to admission into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. To avert this danger a careful <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral preparation was needed: <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> to guard against the arguments of the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; moral, to give strength against the torments of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecutors</a>. This is the "trial of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> more precious than gold which is tried by the fire" of which <a href="11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> speaks (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs7">1 Peter 1:7</a>). Hence we find in <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin's</a> first Apology (c. lxi, P.G, VI, 420), distinct reference to the twofold preparation and also to the more elaborate rites of initiation: "Those who are persuaded and <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of our teachings (<em>didaskomena</em>) and sayings undertake to live accordingly; they are taught to ask, with <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, the remission of their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>; we also <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> and <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> with them. Then they are led by us to a place where there is water, and they are <a href="12714a.htm">regenerated</a> in the same way that we have been regenerated", etc. By the end of the second century we find the catechumenate in force in all its main lines. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> reproaches the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> with disregarding it; among them, he says "one does not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> which is the catechumen and which the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, all alike come [to the mysteries], all hear the same discourses and say the same <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>" (<em>quis catechumenus, quis fidelis incertum est; pariter adeunt, pariter audiunt, pariter orant</em>), "Catechumens are initiated before they are instructed" (<em>ante sunt perfecti catechumeni quam edocti</em>.--"De Praeser."xli, P.L., II, 56) A little later we read of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> being in charge of the <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> (<em>tou tes katecheseos didaskaleiou</em>) at Alexandria (Euseb., Hist., Eccl., VI, iii). It is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to quote further authorities for the third and fourth centuries, the age in which the catechumenate flourished in its full form. During the years of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> the necessity of the institution was realized, and in the intervals of peace the arrangements were more and more elaborated. When, however, <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> finally triumphed over <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>, the reasons for retaining the catechumenate became less urgent. The majority were born of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>, and so were brought up in the Faith, and were in no danger of falling into <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>. Moreover, with the increasing development of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of grace, and <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> the practice of early <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> became the rule. Further, the conversion of the barbarians precluded the possibility of submitting them to any prolonged period of preparation. Hence the catechumenate gradually fell into disuse, and has merely left traces in the existing rites of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and reception in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Still, even now, an informal species of the old regulations should be observed in the case of grown up converts.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>II. The catechumens were divided into mere inquirers (<em>audientes, akromeni</em>) and catechumens properly so-called; and in each stage there was a three-fold preparation &#151; <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a>, <a href="01767c.htm">ascetical</a>, and <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a>.</p>

<p>(1) If a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> wished to become a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> he was given some elementary instruction in the fundamental doctrines and practices of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="05075b.htm">CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE</a>). He had to show by his conduct that he was in earnest about the step he was about to take. So far, he was only in the stage of inquiry, and was not counted as a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> at all. He was allowed to be present at the first part of the <a href="09790b.htm">Mass</a>, but he was dismissed immediately after the <a href="07448a.htm">sermon</a>.</p>

<p>(2) As soon as his instructors were satisfied that he was likely to persevere, the inquirer was promoted to the rank of catechumen. He was now entitled to be called a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, though he was not looked upon as one of the "faithful". "Ask a man, 'Are you a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>?' He answers, 'No', if he is a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> or a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>. But if he says 'Yes', ask him again, 'Are you a catechumen or one of the faithful?'" (<a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../fathers/1701044.htm">Tractate 44 on the Gospel of John, no. 2</a>).</p>

<p>In the early ages the rites of admission to the catechumenate were quite simple, but in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> they became more elaborate. At first the candidates were merely signed on the forehead with the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, or <a href="07698a.htm">hands were imposed on them</a> with suitable <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>; and sometimes both ceremonies were used. Thus <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in his model of an instruction to an inquirer says: "He should be asked whether he believes what he has heard, and is ready to observe it. If he answers in the affirmative he should be solemnly <a href="13785a.htm">signed</a> and treated according to the custom of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>" (<em>solemniter signandus est et ecclesiae more tractandus.</em>-- De Cat. Rud., xxvi, P.L., XL, 344). <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> mentions the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (Vita Constantini, iv. 61, P.G., XX, 1213). Among the Latins, and especially at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, breathing accompanied with a form of <a href="05709a.htm">exorcism</a> and placing in the mouth a little <a href="05709a.htm">exorcised</a> salt, was employed in addition to the signing with the cross and the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. Other rites were the opening of the ears (<a href="../bible/mar007.htm#vrs34">Mark 7:34</a>) and anointing. See Mart&egrave;ne, "De Antiquis Ecclesiae Ritibus" (Rouen, 1700), I, where several <em>ordines ad fasciendum Christianum</em>, or <em>catechumenum</em>, are given; <a href="03588c.htm">Chardon</a>, "Hist. des Sacrements", in <a href="10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Theol. Cursus Completus", Paris, 1874, XX, 31 sqq., 149 sqq.</p>

<p>Catechumens when present at Mass were not dismissed with the inquirers, but were detained while a special <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> was recited over them. They then also withdrew before the Mass of the Faithful began. The instruction which they received is described in the article <a href="05075b.htm">CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE</a>. As to their standard of living they had to abstain from all immoral and <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> practices, and give <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> by their virtue and works of penance that they were worthy to begin a more immediate preparation for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The duration of this stage was not fixed. In general it lasted long enough to test the dispositions of the catechumen. The council of Elvira alludes to the custom of making it last two years and the <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> fixed it at this (Justinian, Novel. cxliv). But the causes which ultimately led to the abolition of the catechumenate (see above) tended also to shorten it. Thus the <a href="01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> (506) allowed even <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> (with regard to whom special caution was required) to receive <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> after eight months preparation; and later on <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> reduced the term to forty days. On the other hand the duration of the catechumenate might be extended, and the catechumen might be reduced to the rank of the <em>audientes</em>, if he was guilty of grave crimes (fifth canon of Neoc&aelig;sarea, fourteenth canon of Nicaea). What seems extraordinary to our modern notions is that the catechumens themselves put off their <a href="02258b.htm">baptisms</a> for many years, sometimes even till their last illness. <a href="04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> is an example of this extreme delay. <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, and <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> were not <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> till after their thirtieth year. A question much discussed was the fate of those who died in this stage. As we have seen, they were looked upon as <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but not as belonging to the <a href="05769a.htm">"faithful"</a>, because the cleansing waters of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> had not been poured over their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory</a> describes his terror during a storm at sea lest he might be taken away unbaptized (Carmen de Vita Sua, 324, sqq., P.G. XXXVII, 994). However, St. Ambrose has no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of Valentinian the Younger, who has asked for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but had died before the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> could reach him ("De Obitu Valentini.", n. 51, P.L. XVI, 1374). Hence the common teaching was that the defect of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> might be supplied by desire. This was especially held with regard to those who were in the later stage of immediate preparation, to be described presently. On this whole question see <a href="06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, "De Ecclesia" (Rome, 1887), 414 sqq.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>(3) When the catechumens had completed this stage of preparation and trial, their names were inscribed among the <em>competentes</em>; i.e. those seeking to be <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The Greeks called them <em>photizomenoi</em>. This might mean that they were being enlightened in the mysteries of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>; or, more probably, that they were being <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, for the Greeks commonly spoke of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> as "light" (cf. <a href="../bible/heb006.htm#vrs4">Hebrews 6:4</a>; <a href="../bible/heb010.htm#vrs32">10:32</a>). In this advanced stage they were sometimes called <em>fideles</em> by anticipation (e.g. <a href="04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, Cat., I, 4; V, 1; P.G., XXXIII, 373, 505). <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> was the time when the three-fold preparation &#151; instructive, ascetical, and <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> &#151; was carried on. The ascetical preparation was severe. <a href="12345b.htm">Prayer</a> and <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> naturally formed part of it; but the <em>competentes</em> were also exhorted to keep silence as far as possible and, if they were married, to observe continence. (<a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, "Apol.", lxi, P.G., VI, 420; <a href="04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, Cat., I, sub fin., P.G., XXXIII, col. 376; St. August., "De Fide et Op.", ix, P.L. XL, 205). Confession was also enjoined (<a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "De Bapt.", xx, P.L. I, 1222 where he quotes <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs6">Matthew 3:6</a>: "they were <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, confessing their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>". See also St. Cyril, ib.; <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/25024.htm"><em>Life of Constantine</em> IV.61</a>). The instruction given at this time is described in the article <a href="05075b.htm">CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE</a>, where an account of St. Cyril's "catecheses" will be found.</p>

<p>The rites connected with this stage were elaborate. There are considerable survivals of them in the first part of the order of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and also traces in the <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> Masses, especially the Mass of the Wednesday of the fourth week. The assemblies were called "scrutinies" (examination and presentation of the candidates), and were seven in number. At the first scrutiny the candidates gave in their names. After the collect of the Mass, and before the lessons, the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="05709a.htm">exorcism</a> was performed over them. This was done at all the scrutinies except the last, by the <a href="05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, and then the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> signed them with the cross and laid hands upon them. It is interesting to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that the words at present used in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> "Ergo, maledicte diabole", etc. belonged to the <a href="05709a.htm">exorcism</a>, and the words "Aeternam ac justissimam pietatem" etc. belonged to the <a href="07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>. The third scrutiny was of a specially solemn character, for it was then that the candidates received the Gospel, the <a href="04478a.htm">Symbol (Creed)</a>, and the <a href="09356a.htm">Our Father</a>. Each of these was accompanied by a short explanation. For example, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> has left four sermons (lvi-lix) "De Oratione Domenica ad competentes" (P.L., XXXVIII, 377 sqq.), and three on the delivery of the <a href="04478a.htm">Symbol</a> (ibid., 1058 sqq.). In our present <a href="10354c.htm">missal</a> the Mass of the Wednesday of the fourth week in <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> has a lesson in addition to the ordinary Epistle, or rather lesson. The former is taken from the thirty-sixth chapter of Ezechiel, the latter from the <a href="../bible/isa050.htm">fiftieth of Isaiah</a>; and both (together with the <a href="08081a.htm">Introit</a> and the two Graduals, and the Gospel, the healing of the man born blind, <a href="../bible/joh009.htm">John 9</a>) have obvious reference to the "great scrutiny". The seventh scrutiny took place on <a href="07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, apart from the Mass, as indeed there was formerly no Mass for that day. The <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> himself performed the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the <a href="05709a.htm">exorcism</a> and the Ephphetha (<a href="../bible/mar007.htm">Mark 7</a>). Then followed the anointing on the breast and back. The candidates pronounced the three-fold renunciation of <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a> and recited the Creed. The actual initiation, (<a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, confirmation, and Communion) took place at the Paschal Mass, at which the <a href="10742a.htm">neophytes</a> assisted for the first time, being now no longer mere catechumens. But until the Sunday after <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> they were considered as "infants", receiving further instruction, especially on the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which had lately been conferred upon them (<em>see</em> <a href="03712a.htm">CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE</a>). Finally, on <a href="09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a> (<em>Dominica in Albis depositis</em>) when the <a href="08081a.htm">Introit</a> of the Mass speaks of the "new born babes" (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs2">1 Peter 2:2</a>), they put off their white garments, and were henceforth counted among the regular "faithful".</p>
