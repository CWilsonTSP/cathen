<p>(PIETRO FRANCESCO ORSINI)</p>

<p>Born 2 February, 1649; died 23 February, 1730. Being a son of Ferdinando Orsini and Giovanna Frangipani of Tolpha, he belonged to the archducal <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Orsini-Gravina. From early youth he exhibited a decided liking for the <a href="12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, and at the age of sixteen during a visit to <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> he entered the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> against the will of his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, though he was the eldest son and heir to the title and estates of his childless uncle the Duke of Bracciano. Their appeal to <a href="04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> was fruitless; the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> not only approved the purpose of the young <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a>, but even shortened his <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> by half in order to free him from the importunities of his relatives. As student and <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a>, the young prince was a model of <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and devoted himself to the acquisition of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> learning. At the age of twenty-one he was promoted to a professorship. On 22 February, 1672, he was elevated to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> by his relative <a href="04028b.htm">Clement X</a>. He protested strenuously against the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, but was compelled to accept it under the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience by the General of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, at the insistence of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. As <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> he adhered strictly to the observance of the rule of his order, and never laid aside his habit. In 1675 having the choice between the Archbishopric of <a href="13396b.htm">Salerno</a> and that of <a href="09588a.htm">Manfredonia</a> (Siponto) he chose the latter because it was a poor diocese and required great exercise of pastoral <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. His virtuous life not only overcame the opposition made by his relatives when he became a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, but exercised such a salutary influence that in time his mother, his sister, and two of his nieces embraced the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the Third <a href="12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>. During the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> that followed the death of <a href="04028b.htm">Clement X</a> (1676), he was one of the band of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> known as the <em>zelanti</em> who had agreed that no considerations of worldly <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> would influence them in the choice of a new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. In the government of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Cardinal Orsini was unremitting in his labours and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He visited even the most remote hamlets and was not less watchful over temporal than over spiritual things. He provided for the needs of the people, repaired churches and held a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, the decrees of which he published. In 1680, when <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> transferred him to <a href="03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, he left to the people of Siponto a memorial of his apostolic activity, his devotion to the poor and his constant preaching brought about a thorough-going reformation among both <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. Seeing on his frequent journeys the condition of the churches in even the poorest <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, he neglected none and by the <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of strict rules, he abolished all known abuses.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1686, a serious illness, attributed by his physicians to the climate, caused his transfer to <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, where he remained for thirty-eight years or until he was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. During this long period he seldom left his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Each year he made an episcopal visitation to every <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>. Whenever <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, he built or renovated churches. He built <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and strove incessantly for the alleviation of the sufferings of the poor. Twice during his episcopate (5 June, 1688, and 14 March, 1702) <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a> was visited by earthquakes and on these occasions his <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, his active charity in behalf of the stricken inhabitants, and his energy in the reconstruction of the city, won for him the title of the "Second Founder" of <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. He held two <a href="12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, the first in 1693 attended by eighteen <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the second in 1698, with an attendance of twenty, the acts of which were approved at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The only reproach made against his administration is that his simplicity and child-like confidence exposed him to the wiles of some unscrupulous <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who abused his confidence.</p>

<p>Cardinal Orsini had already taken part in four <a href="04192a.htm">conclaves</a>, when <a href="08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a> died in March, 1724; and in all he had acted in the spirit of the <em>zelanti</em>. The <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> at which he was himself chosen assembled on 20 March; two months afterwards (25 May) no choice had been made. This long delay weighed heavily on the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of Orsini, who commenced a novena of <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> to his patron, <a href="12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, that the election of a new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> might be no longer delayed. Before the novena was finished he saw with terror that he himself would be chosen, and, reluctant to accept a position which filled him with dread, he sought by all means in his power to prevent his election. Against his oft repeated protestations he was chosen 29 May, 1724, and even after the final vote was taken he refused to yield, arguing that his age, his physical weakness, his incapacity, and a resolution which he made never to become <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, should exempt him from such a grave responsibility. He yielded only when it was made clear to him that grave dangers were to be feared if the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> should be reopened. So with tears, and obeying the command of the general of his order, he allowed himself to be proclaimed <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. In <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, a member of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, he took the name of Benedict XIV, which he shortly changed to Benedict XIII as <a href="09431c.htm">Peter de Luna</a> who had previously borne the name (1394-1423) was a <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a>.</p>

<p>His first concern as <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was to enforce rigidly <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. He issued several decrees on <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dress and was unsparing in his efforts to abolish any semblance of luxury or worldly pomp among the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. During the Jubilee of 1725, he discharged personally the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of Grand Penitentiary, and is said to have seriously considered the revival of public penances for certain grave offences. In order to encourage the foundation of <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, he organized a special commission (<em>Congregatio Seminariorum</em>). At a provincial Roman Lateran <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 1725, he required an unqualified acceptance of the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Unigenitus</em> and through his efforts <a href="11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, was led to accept it in 1728. During his pontificate Benedict retained the Archbishopric of <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a> which he administered by a <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and which he twice visited (1727, 1729).</p>

<p>In diplomatic matters and in his relations with foreign powers Benedict did not exhibit the vigour and conservatism which marked his administration in religious matters. His <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of peace led him to attempt a settlement of the dispute in regard to the <a href="12437a.htm">ecclesiastical privileges</a> of the Kings of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> (<em><a href="10451a.htm">Monarchia Sicula</a></em>) by a revocation of the constitution of <a href="04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (1715) and by granting to the King of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> (and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>) and his successors the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint a spiritual judge in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, reserving, however, the most important cases to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The quarrel with Victor Amadeus of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> was compounded by giving to the king the right of patronage over the churches and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in his dominions, without, however, conceding any claim to the incomes from vacant <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Towards John V, King of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> exhibited extraordinary firmness in refusing a claim based on the privileges held by other courts to propose candidates for the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. This was in consequence of the protests made by the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> against the election of Vincenzo Biechi, Nuncio to <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. In retaliation John recalled all Portuguese residents in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, forbade all communication with the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, and attempted to prevent the sending of the customary <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> from <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; he also interfered with applications for <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> from matrimonial impediments. At many courts of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> grave offense was taken by the extension (1728) to the Universal Church of the Office of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> containing an account of the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and deposition of <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>, which to Gallicans and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> seemed offensive.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Although full <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> can scarcely be done to the virtuous life and the fatherly <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the interests of religion of Benedict, his pontificate lost much of its lustre because of his misplaced confidence in Cardinal Nicol&ograve; Coscia, who had been his coadjutor at <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the peculations and venality of his favourite, whose <a href="02148b.htm">greed</a> did much to diminish the prestige of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and against whom a popular uprising took place on the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> death, resulting in ten years' <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for this unworthy <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Benedict's <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings were published in three volumes (Ravenna, 1728).</p>
