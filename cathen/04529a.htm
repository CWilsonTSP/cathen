<h2 id="section1">Growth of the Christian cult</h2>

<p>The Cross to which <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> had been nailed, and on which He had died, became for <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, quite naturally and <a href="09324a.htm">logically</a>, the object of a special respect and worship. <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says, in <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs17">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>: "For Christ sent me not to <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a>; but to preach the gospel: not in wisdom of speech, lest the cross of Christ should be made void"; in <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs19">Galatians 2:19</a>: "With Christ I am nailed to the cross"; in <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs16">Ephesians 2:16</a>: Christ . . . . "might reconcile both to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in one body by the cross"; in <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs18">Philippians 3:18</a>: "For many walk . . . enemies of the cross of Christ"; in <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs14">Colossians 2:14</a>: "Blotting out the handwriting of the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> that was against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross"; and in <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#vrs14">Galatians 6:14</a>: "But <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of <a href="08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It seems clear, therefore, that for <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> the Cross of Christ was not only a precious remembrance of <a href="11527b.htm">Christ's sufferings and death</a>, but also a symbol closely associated with His sacrifice and the mystery of the Passion. It was, moreover, natural that it should be <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> and become an object of a cult with the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had been saved by it. Of such a cult in the Primitive Church we have definite and sufficiently numerous evidences. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> meets the objection that <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> adore the cross by answering with an <em>argumentum ad hominem</em>, not by a denial. Another <a href="01618a.htm">apologist</a>, <a href="10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a>, replies to the same objection. Lastly we may recall the famous caricature of Alexamenos, for which see the article <em>Ass</em>. From all this it appears that the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>, without further consideration of the matter, believed that the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> adored the cross; and that the apologists either answered indirectly, or contented themselves with saying that they do not adore the cross, without denying that a certain form of veneration was paid to it.</p>

<p>It is also an accepted <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> that in the decorations of the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a> there have been found, if not the cross itself, at least more or less veiled allusions to the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> symbol. A detailed treatment of this and other historical evidence for the early prevalence of the cult will be found in <a href="04517a.htm">ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CROSS AND CRUCIFIX</a>.</p>

<p>This cult became more extensive than ever after the discovery of the Holy Places and of the True Cross. Since the time when <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> had been laid waste and ruined in the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of the Romans, especially since <a href="07104b.htm">Hadrian</a> had founded upon the ruins his colony of &AElig;lia Capitolina, the places <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the Passion, Death, and Burial of Christ had been profaned and, it would seem, deserted. Under Constantine, after peace had been vouchsafed to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, Macarius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, caused excavations to be made (about A.D. 327, it is believed) in order to ascertain the location of these holy sites. That of Calvary was identified, as well as that of the Holy Sepulchre; it was in the course of these excavations that the wood of the Cross was recovered. It was recognized as authentic, and for it was built a <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> or oratory, which is mentioned by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, also by <a href="04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, and Silvia (Etheria). From A.D. 347, that is to say, twenty years after these excavations, the same St. Cyril, in his discourses (or <em>catecheses</em>) delivered in these very places (iv, 10; x, 14; xiii, 4) speaks of this sacred wood. An inscription of A.D. 359, found at Tixter, in the neighbourhood of S&eacute;tif in Mauretania, mentions in an enumeration of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>, a fragment of the True Cross (Roman Miscellanies, X, 441). For a full discussion of the legend of St. Helena, see <a href="04517a.htm">ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CROSS AND CRUCIFIX</a>; see also <a href="07202b.htm">ST. HELENA</a>. Silvia's recital (Peregrinatio Etheriae), which is of indisputable authenticity, tells how the sacred wood was <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> about A.D. 380. On <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, at eight o'clock in the morning, the faithful and the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> assemble in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Cross (built on a site hard by Calvary), and at this spot the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the adoration takes place. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is seated on his chair; before him is a table covered with a cloth; the <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> are standing around him. The silver-gilt <a href="12762a.htm">reliquary</a> is brought and opened and the sacred wood of the Cross, with the Title, is placed on the table. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> stretches out his hand over the <a href="12734a.htm">holy relic</a>, and the <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> keep watch with him while the faithful and <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> defile, one by one, before the table, bow, and <a href="08663a.htm">kiss</a> the Cross; they touch the Cross and the Title with forehead and eyes, but it is forbidden to touch them with the hands. This minute watchfulness was not unnecessary, for it has been told in fact how one day one of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, making as though to <a href="08663a.htm">kiss</a> the Cross, was so unscrupulous as to bite off a piece of it, which he carried off as a <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a>. It is the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> to prevent the repetition of such a crime. St. Cyril, who also tells of this <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, makes his account much more brief but adds the important detail, that <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the True Cross have been distributed all over the world. He adds some information as to the silver <a href="12762a.htm">reliquary</a> which contained the True Cross. (See Cabrol, La Peregrinatio ad loca sancta, 105.) In several other passages of the same work Silvia (also called Egeria, Echeria, Eiheria, and Etheria) speaks to us of this <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Cross (built between the <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of the Anastasis and the Martyrion) which plays so great a part in the paschal <a href="08371a.htm">liturgy of Jerusalem</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>A law of Theodosius and of <a href="15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a> (Cod. Justin., I, tit. vii) forbade under the gravest penalties any <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a>, carving, or engraving of the cross on pavements, so that this august sign of our <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> might not be trodden under foot. This law was revised by the <a href="04311b.htm">Trullan Council</a>, A.D. 691 (canon lxxii). <a href="08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>, on the other hand, according to <a href="04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (Contra Julian., vi, in Opp., VI), made it a crime for <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> to adore the wood of the Cross, to trace its form upon their foreheads, and to engrave it over the entrances of their homes. <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> more than once in his writings makes allusion to the adoration of the cross; one citation will suffice: "Kings removing their diadems take up the cross, the symbol of their Saviour's death; on the purple, the cross; in their <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the cross; on their armour, the cross; on the holy table, the cross; throughout the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>, the cross. The cross shines brighter than the sun." These quotations from <a href="08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> may be found in the authorities to be named at the end of this article. At the same time, <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the holy places became more frequent, and especially for the purpose of following the example set by St. Helena in venerating the True Cross. <a href="08341a.htm">Saint Jerome</a>, describing the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of <a href="11582a.htm">St. Paula</a> to the Holy Places, tells us that "prostrate before the Cross, she adored it as though she had seen the Saviour hanging upon it" (Ep. cviii). It is a remarkable fact that even the <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a>, who fought with such <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> against images and representations in relief, made an exception in the case of the cross. Thus we find the image of the cross on the <a href="11152a.htm">coins</a> of the <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> emperors, Leo the Isaurian, Constantine Copronymus, Leo IV, Nicephorus, Michael II, and Theophilus (cf. Banduri, Numism. Imperat. Rom., II). Sometimes this cult involved abuses. Thus we are told of the Staurolaters, or those who adore the cross; the Chazingarii (from <em>chazus</em>, cross), a <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> who adore the cross. The <a href="11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (A.D. 787), held for the purpose of reforming abuses and putting an end to the disputes of <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>, fixed, once for all, the <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and discipline on this point. It <a href="04675b.htm">defined</a> that the veneration of the faithful was due to the form "of the precious and vivifying cross", as well as to images or representations of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of the Blessed Virgin, and of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. But the council points out that we must not render to these objects the cult of <em>latria</em>, "which, according to the teaching of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, belongs to the Divine nature alone . . . . The <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> paid to the image passes to the prototype; and he who adores the image, adores the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> whom it represents. Thus the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of our holy fathers obtains in all its force: the tradition of the Holy <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> which from one end of the earth to the other has received the gospel." This <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> was renewed at the <a href="04310b.htm">Eighth Ecumenical Council</a> at Constantinople, in 869 (can. iii). The council clearly distinguishes between the "salutation" (<em>aspasmos</em>) and "veneration" (<em>proskynesis</em>) due to the cross, and the "true adoration" (<em>alethine latreia</em>), which should not be paid to it. Theodore the Studite, the great adversary of the <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a>, also makes a very exact distinction between the <em>adoratio relativa</em> (<em>proskynesis schetike</em>) and adoration properly so called.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Catholic doctrine on the veneration of the Cross</h2>

<p>In passing to a detailed examination of the <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on this subject of the cult due to the Cross, it will be well to notice the theories of Brock, the Abb&eacute; Ansault, le Mortillet, and others who pretend to have discovered that cult among the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> before the time of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For a demonstration of the purely <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> origin of the <a href="12275b.htm">Christian devotion</a> the reader is referred to <a href="04517a.htm">ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CROSS AND CRUCIFIX</a>. See also the works of De Harley, Lafargue, and others cited at the end of this section. With reference, in particular, to the ansated cross of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Letronne, <a href="13104b.htm">Raoul-Rochette</a>, and Lajard discuss with much learning the symbolism of that simple hieroglyphic of life, in which the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> seem to have recognized an anticipatory revelation of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> Cross, and which they employed in their monuments. According to the text of the <a href="11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> cited above, the cult of the Cross is based upon the same principles as that of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> and images in general, although, to be sure, the True Cross holds the highest place in dignity among all <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>. The observation of <a href="11743a.htm">Petavius</a> (XV, xiii, 1) should be noted here: that this cult must be considered as not belonging to the substance of religion, but as being one of the <em>adiaphora</em>, or things not absolutely <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Indeed, while it is of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> that this cult is useful, lawful, even <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and worthy of praise and of encouragement, and while we are not permitted to speak against it as something pernicious, still it is one of those devotional practices which the church can encourage, or restrain, or stop, according to circumstances. This explains how the veneration of images was forbidden to the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> by that text of <a href="../bible/exo020.htm#vrs4">Exodus (20:4 sqq.)</a> which has been so grossly abused by <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>: "Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing that is in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them: I am the <a href="06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a>," etc. It also explains the fact that in the first ages of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, when converts from <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> were so numerous, and the impression of <a href="07636a.htm">idol-worship</a> was so fresh, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> found it advisable not to permit the development of this cult of images; but later, when that danger had disappeared, when <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> traditions and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="08050b.htm">instinct</a> had gained strength, the cult developed more freely. Again, it should be noted that the cult of images and <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> is not that of <em>latria</em>, which is the adoration due to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone, but is, as the <a href="11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> teaches, a relative veneration paid to the image or <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> and referring to that which it represents. Precisely this same <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is repeated in Sess. XXV of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>: "Images are not to be worshipped because it is believed that some divinity or power resides in them and that they must be worshipped on that account, or because we ought to ask anything of them, or because we should put our trust in them, as was done by the <a href="06422a.htm">gentiles</a> of old who placed their hope in idols but because the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> which is shown to them is referred to the prototypes which they represent; so that through the images which we <a href="08663a.htm">kiss</a>, and before which we kneel, we may adore Christ, and venerate the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, whose resemblances they bear." (See also <a href="07664a.htm">IMAGES</a>.)</p>

<p>This clear <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which cuts short every objection, is also that taught by <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, by <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, and by <a href="11743a.htm">Petavius</a>. It must be said, however, that this view was not always so clearly taught. Following <a href="01264a.htm">Bl. Albertus Magnus</a> and <a href="01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and a section of the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> who appear to have overlooked the <a href="11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> teach that the worship rendered to the Cross and the image of Christ is that of <em>latria</em>, but with a distinction: the same worship is due to the image and its exemplar but the exemplar is <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> for Himself (or for itself), with an absolute worship; the image because of its exemplar, with a relative worship. The object of the adoration is the same, primary in regard to the exemplar and secondary in regard to the image. To the image of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then, we owe a worship of <em>latria</em> as well as to His Person. The image, in fact, is morally one with its prototype, and, thus considered, if a lesser degree of worship be rendered to the image, that worship must reach the exemplar lessened in degree. Against this theory an attack has recently been made in "The Tablet", the opinion attributed to the <a href="14698b.htm">Thomists</a> being sharply combated. Its adversaries have endeavoured to prove that the image of Christ should be <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> but with a lesser degree of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> than its exemplar.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The cult paid to it, they say, is simply analogous to the cult of <em>latria</em>, but in its nature different and inferior. No image of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then, should be <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the worship of <em>latria</em>, and, moreover, the term "relative <em>latria</em>", invented by the <a href="14698b.htm">Thomists</a>, ought to be banished from <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> language as equivocal and dangerous.-- Of these opinions the former rests chiefly upon consideration of pure reason, the latter upon <a href="15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a>, notably upon the <a href="11045a.htm">Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> and its confirmation by the <a href="04310b.htm">Fourth Council of Constantinople</a> and upon the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Relics of the True Cross</h2>

<p>The testimony of Silvia (Etheria) proves how highly these <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> were prized, while <a href="04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, her contemporary, testifies as explicitly that "the whole inhabited earth is full of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the wood of the Cross". In 1889 two French arch&aelig;ologists, Letaille and Audollent, discovered in the district of S&eacute;tif an inscription of the year 359 in which, among other <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>, is mentioned the sacred wood of the Cross (<em>de ligno crucis et de terr&acirc; promissionis ubi natus est Christus</em>). Another inscription, from Rasgunia (Cape Matifu), somewhat earlier in date than the preceding, mentions another <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Cross ("sancto ligno salvatoris adlato".-- See Duchesne in Acad. des inscr., Paris, 6 December, 1889; Morel, "Les missions catholiques", 25 March, 1890, p. 156; Catech. iv in P.G., XXXIII, 469; cf. also ibid., 800; Procopius, "De Bello Persico", II, xi). <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> tells us that fragments of the True Cross are kept in golden <a href="12762a.htm">reliquaries</a>, which men reverently wear upon their <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<p>The passage in the "Peregrinatio" which treats of this devotion has already been cited. <a href="11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>, some years later, sends to Sulpicius Severus a fragment of the True Cross with these words: "Receive a great gift in a little [compass]; and take, in [this] almost atomic segment of a short dart, an armament [against the perils] of the present and a pledge of everlasting safety" (Epist. xxxi, n.1. P.L., LXI, 325). About 455 Juvenal, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, sends to <a href="09154b.htm">Pope St. Leo</a> a fragment of the precious wood (S. Leonis Epist. cxxxix, P.L., LIV, 1108). The <a href="09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, if we are to accept the authenticity of its statement, tells us that, in the pontificate of St. Sylvester, Constantine presented to the Sessorian basilica (Santa Croce in Gerusalemme) in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> a portion of the True Cross (Duchesne <a href="09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a>, I, 80; cf. 78, 178, 179, 195). Later, under St. Hilary (461-68) and under Symmachus (498-514) we are again told that fragments of the True Cross are enclosed in altars (op. cit., I, 242 sq. and 261 sq.). About the year 500 Avitus, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vienne, asks for a portion of the Cross from the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (P.L., LIX, 236, 239).</p>

<p>It is known that Radegunda, Queen of the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>, having retired to <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, obtained from the Emperor Justin II, in 569, a remarkable <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the True Cross. A solemn feast was celebrated on this occasion, and the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded by the queen at <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> received from that moment the name of Holy Cross. It was also upon this occasion that <a href="06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, and a celebrated poet of the period, composed the <a href="07595a.htm">hymn</a> <a href="15396a.htm">"Vexilla Regis"</a> which is still sung at feasts of the Cross in the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a> sent, a little later, a portion of the Cross to Theodolinda, Queen of the Lombards (Ep. xiv, 12), and another to Recared, the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Ep. ix, 122). In 690, under <a href="13728b.htm">Sergius I</a>, a casket was found containing a <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the True Cross which had been sent to <a href="08422a.htm">John III</a> (560-74) by the Emperor Justin II (cf. Borgia, "De Cruce Vatican&acirc;", Rome, 1779, p. 63, and Duchesne, <a href="09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, I, 374, 378). We will not give in detail the history of other <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Cross (see the works of <a href="07029b.htm">Gretser</a> and the articles of Kraus and B&auml;umer quoted in the bibliography). The work of <a href="13117b.htm">Rohault de Fleury</a>, "M&eacute;moire sur les instruments de la Passion" (Paris, 1870), deserves more prolonged attention; its author has sought out with great care and learning all the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the True Cross, drawn up a catalogue of them, and, thanks to this labour, he has succeeded in showing that, in spite of what various <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> or <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> authors have pretended, the fragments of the Cross brought together again would not only not "be comparable in bulk to a battleship", but would not reach one-third that of a cross which has been supposed to have been three or four metres in height, with transverse branch of two metres (see above; under I), proportions not at all abnormal (op. cit., 97-179). Here is the calculation of this savant: Supposing the Cross to have been of pine-wood, as is believed by the savants who have made a special study of the subject, and giving it a weight of about seventy-five kilograms, we find that the volume of this cross was 178,000,000 cubic millimetres. Now the total known volume of the True Cross, according to the finding of <a href="13117b.htm">M. Rohault de Fleury</a>, amounts to above 4,000,000 cubic millimetres, allowing the missing part to be as big as we will, the lost parts or the parts the existence of which has been overlooked, we still find ourselves far short of 178,000,000 cubic millimetres, which should make up the True Cross.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Principal feasts of the Cross</h2>

<p>The Feast of the Cross like so many other <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> feasts, had its origin at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and is connected with the commemoration of the Finding of the Cross and the building, by Constantine, of churches upon the sites of the Holy Sepulchre and Calvary. In 335 the dedication of these churches was celebrated with great solemnity by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had assisted at the Council of <a href="15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and a great number of other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This dedication took place on the 13th and 14th of September. This feast of the dedication, which was known by the name of the <em>Encnia,</em> was most solemn; it was on an equal footing with those of the Epiphany and <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>. The description of it should be read in the "Peregrinatio", which is of great value upon this subject of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> origins. This solemnity attracted to Jerusalem a great number of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, from Mesopotamia, from <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, from <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from the Theba&iuml;d, and from other provinces, besides <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> of both sexes. Not fewer than forty or fifty <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> would journey from their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> to be present at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> for the event. The feast was considered as of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, "and he thinks himself guilty of a grave <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> who during this period does not attend the great solemnity". It lasted eight days. In <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, then, this feast bore an entirely local character. It passed, like so many other feasts, to Constantinople and thence to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There was also an endeavour to give it a local feeling, and the church of "The Holy Cross in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" as intended, as its name indicates, to recall the memory of the church at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> bearing the same dedication.</p>

<p>The <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Exaltation of the Cross sprang into existence at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the end of the seventh century. Allusion is made to it during the pontificate of <a href="13728b.htm">Sergius I</a> (687-701) but, as Dom B&auml;umer observes, the very terms of the text (Lib. Pontif., I, 374, 378) show that the feast already existed. It is, then, inexact, as has often been pointed out, to attribute the introduction of it to this <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The Gallican churches, which, at the period here referred to, do not yet <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> of this feast of the 14th September, have another on the 3rd of May of the same signification. It seems to have been introduced there in the seventh century, for ancient Gallican documents, such as the Lectionary of Luxeuil, do not mention it; <a href="07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> also seems to ignore it. According to Mgr. Duchesne, the date seems to have been borrowed from the legend of the Finding of the Holy Cross (Lib. Pontif., I, p. cviii). Later, when the Gallican and Roman Liturgies were combined, a distinct character was given to each feast, so as to avoid sacrificing either. The 3rd of May was called the feast of the Invention of the Cross, and it commemorated in a special manner Saint Helena's discovery of the sacred wood of the Cross; the 14th of September, the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, commemorated above all the circumstances in which Heraclius recovered from the <a href="11712a.htm">Persians</a> the True Cross, which they had carried off. Nevertheless, it appears from the history of the two feasts, which we have just examined, that that of the 13th and 14th of September is the older, and that the commemoration of the Finding of the Cross was at first combined with it.</p>

<p>The <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the Adoration of the Cross also had its origin in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, as we have seen, and is a faithful reproduction of the rites of Adoration of the Cross of the fourth century in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> which have been described above, in accordance with the description of the author of the "Peregrinatio". This worship paid to the Cross in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> on <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> soon became general. <a href="07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> speaks of the Wednesday and Friday <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the Cross&mdash;probably the Wednesday and Friday of <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>. (Cf. Greg., De Glori&acirc; Mart. I, v.) The most ancient adoration of the Cross in Church is described in the "Ordo Romanus" generally attributed to <a href="06780a.htm">Saint Gregory</a>. It is performed, according to this "Ordo", just as it is nowadays, after a series of <a href="12787a.htm">responsory</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The cross is prepared before the altar; <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the inferior grades, and lastly the people, each one comes in his turn; they salute the cross, during the singing of the anthem, "Ecce lignum crucis in quo salus mundi pependit. Venite, adoremus" (Behold the wood of the cross on which the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world did hang. Come, let us adore) and then <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a>. (See Mabillon, Mus. Ital., Paris, 1689, II, 23.) The <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> has kept until today the same <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> features in the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, added to it is the song of the <em><a href="07703a.htm">Improperia</a></em> and the <a href="07595a.htm">hymn</a> of the Cross, "Pange, lingua, gloriosi lauream certaminis".</p>

<p>Besides the Adoration of the Cross on <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> and the September feast, the Greeks have still another feast of the Adoration of the Cross on the 1st of August as well as on the third <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>. It is probable that <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> was acquainted with this feast during his stay in Constantinople, and that the station of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, on L&aelig;tare Sunday (the fourth <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>), is a souvenir, or a timid effort at imitation, of the Byzantine solemnity.</p>
