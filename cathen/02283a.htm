<p>Foundress of the <a href="14111b.htm">Society of the Sacred Heart</a>, born at Joigny, <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, 12 December, 1779; died in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 24 May, 1865. She was the youngest child of Jacques Barat, a vine-dresser and cooper, and his wife, Madeleine Fouf&eacute;, and received <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> the morning after her birth, her brother Louis, aged eleven, being chosen godfather. It was to this brother that she owed the exceptional <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> which fitted her for her life-work. Whilst her mother found her an apt pupil in practical matters, Louis saw her singular endowments of mind and heart; and when, at the age of twenty-two, he returned as professor to the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Joigny, he taught his sister Latin, Greek, history, natural <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, Spanish, and Italian. Soon she took delight in reading the classics in the original, and surpassed her brother's pupils at the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>.</p>

<p>After the Reign of Terror, Louis called Sophie to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to train her for the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>, for which she longed. When he had joined the Fathers of the Faith, a band of fervent <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, united in the hope of becoming members of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> on its restoration, he one day spoke of his sister to Father Varin, to whom had been bequeathed by the saintly L&eacute;onor de Tourn&eacute;ly the plan of founding a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> wholly devoted to the worship of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and sacrifice, and destined to do for girls what the restored <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> would do for boys. Father Varin had vainly sought a fitting instrument to begin this work; he now found one in this modest, retiring girl of twenty. He unfolded the project, which seemed to satisfy all her aspirations, and she bowed before his authoritative declaration that this was for her the will of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. With three companions she made her first <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, 21 November, 1800, the date which marks the foundation of the Society of the Sacred Heart. In September, 1801, the first <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was opened at <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and thither Sophie went to help in the work of teaching. It was impossible yet to assume the name "Society of the Sacred Heart", lest a political significance be attached to it; its members were known as <em>Dames de la Foi</em> or <em>de l'Instruction Chr&eacute;tienne.</em> Father Varin allowed Sophie to make her <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, 7 June, 1802, with Genevieve Deshayes.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The community and <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> were increasing, and a poor <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> had just been added, when it became evident to Father Varin that Mademoiselle Loquet, who had hitherto acted as superior, lacked the qualities requisite for the office, and Sophie, although the youngest, was named superior (1802). Her first act was to kneel and <a href="08663a.htm">kiss</a> the feet of each of her sisters. Such was ever the spirit of her government, November, 1804, found her at Sainte-Marie-d'en-Haut, near <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, receiving a community of Visitation <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> into her institute, One of them, Philippine Duchesne, was later to introduce the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> into America. Grenoble was the first of some eighty foundations which Mother Barat was to make, not only in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> but in North America (1818), <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1828), <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> (1830), <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (1834), Algiers (1841). <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> (1842), <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>(1842), <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1846), <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> (1848), <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1851), South America (1853) <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1853), <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1857).</p>

<p>Mother Barat was elected superior-general in January, 1806, but a majority of one vote only, for the influence of an ambitious <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, wellnigh wrecked the nascent institute. Prolonged <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, silent suffering, tact, respect, charity, were only means she used to oppose his designs. With Father Varin, now a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, she elaborated constitutions and rules grafted on the stock of the Institute of St. Ignatius. These rules were received with <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> in all the houses, Amiens alone excepted; but Mother Barat's wisdom and <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> soon won submission even here. In 1818 she sent Mother Duchesne, with four companions, to the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a>; her strong and holy hand was ever ready to support and guide this first missioner of the Society. She called all the superiors together in council at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1820, to provide a uniform course of studies for their <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. These studies were to be solid and serious, to fit the pupils to become intelligent wives and devoted mothers; to give that cultivation of mind, that formation of character, which go to make up a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>; all was to stamped and sealed with strong religious principles and devotion to the Sacred Heart.</p>

<p>Foundations multiplied, and Mother Barat, seeing the necessity of a stronger guarantee of unity, sought it in union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The solemn <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> was obtained much sooner than usual, owing to a memoir drawn up by the foundress and presented to <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> in May, 1826. The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> was <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in December. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> being now fully organized and sealed by Rome's approval, for forty years Mother Barat journeyed from <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> to <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, wrote many thousand letters, and assembled general congregations, so as to preserve its original spirit. The <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> gained <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> repute; <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> counted three establishments, asked for and blessed by three successive pontiffs. At Lyons Mother Barat founded the Congregation of the Children of Mary for former pupils and other ladies. In the same year (1832), she began at <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> the work of retreats for ladies of the world, an apostleship since widely and profitably imitated. Numerous foundations brought Mother Bart onto personal contact with all classes. We find her crossing and recrossing <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, often on the eve of revolutions; now the centre of a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</em> whose <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> gifts, high social position, and moral worth are seldom found united; now sought out by <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and Roman princesses during her vicits to her Roman houses; at another time, speaking on matters <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> with Madame de Genlis; or again, exercising that <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> ascendency which aroused the admiration of such men as Bishop Fraysinous, Doctor R&eacute;camier, and Duc de Rohan.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>These exterior labours were far from absorbing all Mother Barat's time or energies; they coexisted with a life of ever-increasing <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> and continual <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>; for the real secret of her influence lay in her habitual seclusion from the outside world, in the strong religious formation of her daughters which this seclusion made possible, and in the enlightened, profound, and <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> views on <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> which she communicated to the religious engaged in her <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. She worked by and through them all, and thus reached out to the ends of the earth. In spite of herself she attracted and charmed all who approached her. New foundations she always entrusted to other hands; for, like all great rulers, she had the twofold gift of <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> in the choice of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> fitted for office, and trust of those in responsible posts. Allowing them much freedom of action in details, guiding them only by her counsels and usually form afar. Prelates who now and them ventured to attribute to her the successes of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, saw that instead of pleasing, they distressed her exceedingly.</p>

<p>Beloved by her daughters, <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> by princes and pontiffs, yet ever lowly of heart, Mother Barat died at the mother-house in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, on <a href="01767b.htm">Ascension Day</a>, 1865, as she had foretold, after four days' illness. She was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> at Conflans, the house of <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, where her body was found intact in 1893. In 1879 she was declared Venerable, and the process of <a href="02364b.htm">beatification</a> introduced. [<em>Note:</em> Mother Barat was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1925.]</p>
