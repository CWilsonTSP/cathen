<p>"We always act with a view to some good. The good is the object which all pursue, and for the sake of which they always act", says <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a> (Republic, I, vi). His disciple <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> repeats the same <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> in other words when he declares (Ethics, I, i) that the good is "that which all aim at". This definition is, as <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> observes, <em>a posteriori</em>. Yet, if appetibility does not constitute <a href="06636b.htm">goodness</a>, still it is our only means of identifying it; in practice, the good is the desirable. But experience soon teaches that all desires cannot be satisfied, that they are conflicting, and that some goods must be foregone in order to secure others. Hence the necessity of weighing the relative value of goods, of classifying them, and of ascertaining which of them must be procured even at the loss of others. The result is the division of goods into two great classes, the physical and the moral, <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> and <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Within either class it is comparatively easy to determine the relation of particular good things to one another, but it has <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> far more difficult to fix the relative excellence of the two classes of virtue and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Still the question is of supreme importance, since in it the reason and final destiny of our life is involved. As Cicero says (De Finibus, v, 6), "Summum autem bonum si ignoratur, vivendi rationem ignorari necesse est." If <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> and virtue are mutually exclusive, we have to choose between the two, and this choice is a momentous one. But their incompatibility may be only on the surface. Indeed the hope is ever recurring that the sovereign good includes both, and that there is some way of reconciling them.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It has been the task of moralists to sift the conditions on which this may be done.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Some would reduce virtue to <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>;</li><li>others teach that <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> is to be found in virtue;</li><li>but, as both these solutions are ever found to be in contradiction with the facts of life, the consequent vacillations of opinion can be traced throughout the history of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</li></ul></div>

<p>In the main, they can be classified under three heads, according as one or the other predominates, or both are made to blend: viz.:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Eud&aelig;monism or <a href="15241c.htm">Utilitarianism</a>, when the highest good is identified with <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>;</li><li>Rational Deontologism, when the highest good is identified with virtue or <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>;</li><li>Rational Eud&aelig;monism, or tempered Deontologism, when both virtue and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> are combined in the highest good.</li></ul></div>

<h2 id="section1">Eud&aelig;monism</h2>

<h3>A</h3>

<p><a href="14119a.htm">Socrates</a> (469-399 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), the father of systematic Ethics, taught that <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the end of man; that it consists, not in external goods signs of the uncertain favours of fortune, or of the gods (<em>eutychia</em>) &#151; but in a rational <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a>, which implies the renunciation of common delights (<em>eupraxia</em>). He did not, however, carry this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of moderation to the degree of asceticism, but rather insisted on the cultivation of the mind as being of greater importance. Knowledge is the only virtue, <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> the only vice. Yet, from the Dialogues of Xenophon, it is seen that he descends to the common morality of <a href="15241c.htm">Utilitarianism</a>.</p>

<h3>B</h3>

<p>This latter phase of <a href="14119a.htm">Socratic</a> teaching was adopted by Aristippus of <a href="04591b.htm">Cyrene</a> (435-356 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), who as representative of the Hedonistic School among the ancients, and holding, on the one hand, with <a href="14119a.htm">Socrates</a> that <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is virtue, and, on the other, with Protagoras, that we can <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> only our sensations, and not that which causes them, concluded that that which produces in us the most pleasant feelings is the highest good. Culture and virtue are desirable only as a means to this end. As pleasure is conditioned by organic states, it can be produced only by motion, which, to be pleasant, must needs be gentle; hence according to the Cyrenaics, it is not the mere absence of pain, but a transient emotion which makes man <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> and constitutes his highest good.</p>

<h3>C</h3>

<p><a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (384-322 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) admits with <a href="14119a.htm">Socrates</a> and the ancient <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> generally, that the highest good is to be identified with the highest <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and, in determining in what this highest <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists, he agrees with the Cyrenaics that it is not mere passing enjoyment, but action (<em>en to zen kai energein</em>, Eth, Nic., IX, ix, 5). Still it is not any and every kind of activity that man may find agreeable which constitutes this supreme <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but that which is proper to him (<em>okeion ergon &#151; oikeia arete</em>, Ibid., I, vii, 15). This cannot be merely the life which he shares with the plants and animals, or the sensibility, which he enjoys in common with the brutes, but thought, which is the distinctive characteristic of man. Moreover, as it is in the sphere of activity proper to each living being that its peculiar excellence is to be sought, it follows that man's rational activity (<em>psyches energeia meta logou</em>, Ibid., I, vii, 15) is at the same time honourable and virtuous (<em>psyches energeia kat areten</em>, loc. cit.). Since, however, there are several such activities, it must be the noblest and most perfect of these. This is none other than speculative thought, or that which has to do with the contemplation of "honourable and divine subjects" (<em>kalon kai theion</em>, Ibid., X, vii, 10), because this belongs to the noblest faculty and tends to the noblest object; because it is the most continuous, the most pleasant, the most self-sufficing (Ibid., I, x, 8).</p>

<p>In thus defining human <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> does not aim at determining which good is absolutely supreme, but only that which relatively is the highest for man in his present condition &#151; the highest attainable in this life (<em>to panton akrotaton ton prakton agathon</em>, Ibid., I, iv, 16). Though <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> thus makes <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> and the highest good to consist in virtuous action, yet he does not exclude pleasure, but holds that pleasure in its keenest form springs from <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Pleasure completes an action, is added to it, as "to youth its bloom" (<em>oion tois akmaiois he ora</em>, Ibid., X, iv, 8). Since, therefore, <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> places man's highest good in his perfection, which is identical with his <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> and carries with it pleasure, he is rightly accounted a Eud&aelig;monist, though of a nobler sort.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3>D</h3>

<p><a href="05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> (circa 340-270 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), whilst accepting in substance the <a href="07187a.htm">Hedonism</a> of the Cyrenaics, does not admit with them that the highest good lies in the pleasure of motion (<em>hedone en kinesei</em>), but rather in the pleasure of rest (<em>hedone kataskematike</em>); not in the <em>voluptas in motu</em> but in the <em>stabilitas voluptatis,</em> says Cicero (De Finibus, II, v, 3) &#151; that state of deep peace and perfect contentment in which we feel secure against all the storms of life (<em>ataraxia</em>). To attain this is the paramount problem of <a href="05500b.htm">Epicurus's</a> philosophy, to which his empirical <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a> (canonics) and his theory of nature (the materialism of Democritus) are merely preliminaries. Thus the whole of his philosophy is constructed with a view to his Ethics, for which it prepares the way and which completes it.</p>

<p>In holding that the pleasures of the mind are preferable to voluptuousness, inasmuch as they endure, while those of the senses pass with the moment that gives them birth, he is not consistent, seeing that his materialism reduces all the operations of the mind to mere sensations. Finally, as virtue is according to him the tact which impels the wise man to do whatever contributes to his welfare, and makes him avoid the contrary, it cannot be the highest good, but only a means of realizing it. By his materialism <a href="05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> paved the way for modern <a href="15241c.htm">Utilitarianism</a>, which has assumed two forms, viz.:</p>

<h3>E</h3>

<p><a href="05328a.htm">Individual Utilitarianism</a>, which places man's highest good in his greatest personal welfare and pleasure. This is identical with the Greek <a href="07187a.htm">Hedonism</a>, and was revived in the eighteenth century by the <a href="05418a.htm">Encyclopedists</a>, De la Mettrie (1709-1751), Helvetius (1715-1771), Diderot (1713-1784), and De Volney (1757-1820). It was also advocated by the Sensists, Hartley (1704-1757), Priestley (1733-1804) and Hume (1711-1776); and in the nineteenth century by the German <a href="10041b.htm">Materialists</a>, Vogt (1817-1895), Moleschott (1822-1893), and B&uuml;chner (1824-1899);</p>

<h3>F</h3>

<p><a href="01369a.htm">Social Utilitarianism</a>, which is mainly of English origin. In its earliest stage, with Richard Cumberland (1632-1718), and Anthony Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury (1671-1718), it still retained a somewhat subjective character, and placed the highest good in the practice of social benevolence. With <a href="02482b.htm">Jeremy Bentham</a> (1748-1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), it becomes wholly objective. The highest good, so they say, cannot be the <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the individuai, but the <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the many, "the greatest <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the greatest number". Stated in these terms, the proposition is merely a truism. That in general, the <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of a community is superior to the <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of one of its members, is obvious; but, when it comes to be a personal affair, the individuai is no longer a part of the whole, but one party pitted against others, and it is by no means evident, from the positivistic point of view, that his personal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not for him the highest good.</p>

<h3>G</h3>

<p>This passage from self to non-self, from the individual to the community, Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) attempted to derive from the evolutionary principle of "the survival of the fittest". Those <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> have evidently a better chance to survive who oppose their enemies as a body, and therefore who live in <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> (flocks, herds, human associations); and therefore, again, the social <a href="08050b.htm">instincts</a> are destined to survive and grow stronger, while the individualistic ones cannot but disappear. The highest good here is not the <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the individual, not even the <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the present generation, but the sum total of the conditions which make possible the survival and the constant progress of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> at large. Hence in a system of elaborate synthetic philosophy Spencer discusses at great length the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of life and those conditions of psychologie and social existence from which, as from a prearranged premise, he gathers "The Data of Ethics", or Ethics emancipated from the notion of divine legislation.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Deontologism</h2>

<p>Under this head may be classed systems which place the highest human good in the conformity of conduct with reason. It assumes an exaggerated or tempered form, according as it excludes or admits regard for human perfection and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> as one of the elements of morality.</p>

<h3>A</h3>

<p><a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in common with <a href="14119a.htm">Socrates</a> and the minor <a href="14119a.htm">Socratic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, holds that <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the supreme and ultimate object of human endeavour, and that this <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> is identical with the highest good. But when he comes to determine in what this good or <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists, he does so in accordance with the presuppositions of his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system. The <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> in its <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> essence is declared to be an incorporeal spirit destined for the <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> of the Idea; hence its ultimate end and supreme good is to be attained by withdrawing from the life of sense and retiring into pure contemplation of the Idea, which is identical with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Man must, therefore, rise to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and find his chief good in Him. This may be considered the highest good in the objective order, and is found inculcated in those passages of this <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher's</a> writings in which the solution of the supreme problem of life is sought in flight from sensuality (cf. The&aelig;t., 176, A; Ph&aelig;do, 64, E; Republic, VII, 519, C sqq., apud Zeller, pp. 435-444). But inasmuch as this is practically unattainable in this life, man is told that the highest good here is to be found in making himself like <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and that this is to be brought about by the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the enthusiastic <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Supreme Good. In the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, therefore, and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> as the Supreme Good consists man's highest good in the subjective order. This is brought out in those passages in which even sensuous beauty is described as worthy of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, and external activity, sensible pleasure, is included among the component elements of the highest good (cf. Republic, X, 603, E sqq.; Phil., 28,A sqq.; Tim., 59, C).</p>

<p>The <a href="14299a.htm">Stoic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was founded by Zeno of Cittium (350-258 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>). According to its followers, the highest purpose (good) of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="09238c.htm">life</a> is not to be found in contemplation (<em>theoria</em>), as <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a> would have it, but in action. To live according to nature (<em>homologoumenos te physei zen</em>) was their supreme rule of conduct. By this they did not mean that individual nature of man, but the eternal and <a href="09071a.htm">divine law</a> which manifests itself in nature as the measure to which all things in the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> should conform their action. For man to live according to nature, therefore, means to conform his will to the divine will, and in this consists <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Virtue alone is good in the highest sense of the word, and virtue alone is sufficient for <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. As this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> imposes itself through reason, the system is rightly called rational Deontologism.</p>

<h3>C</h3>

<p><a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> agrees with the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoics</a> in placing the essence of the highest good in virtue, and not in <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Yet he thinks our conception of it is incomplete unless it is made to include <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> as well. The highest good may mean either the Supreme (<em>supremum</em>) or the Complete (<em>consummatum</em>). The Supreme is a condition which is itself unconditioned, or is not subordinate to anything else (<em>originarium</em>). The Complete, again, is a whole which is not itself a part of a larger whole of the same kind (perfectissimum). Virtue, or that disposition to act in conformity with the moral law, is not dependent on <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but itself makes man worthy of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. It is, therefore, the highest good, the supreme condition of whatever can be regarded as desirable. But it is not the whole, nor the supreme good, which finite rational beings crave; the complete good includes <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Hence the highest conceivable good must consist in the union of virtue and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> proportioned to morality.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>This is what <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> means by the whole or complete good. Of its two elements, <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>, having no higher condition and being itself the condition of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, is the supreme good. Happiness, however, while it is agreeable to the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who possesses it, is not good in itself and in all respects; it is good only under the condition that a man's conduct is in conformity with the moral law. This is why <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> was wont to say that "nothing can be called good without qualification, but good will"; and since the best it can do in this life is to strive after <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>, the struggle between the desire to obey and the impulse to transgress must continue for ever, making the highest good in this life unattainable.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Rational eud&aelig;monism or tempered deontologism</h2>

<p><a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, in dealing with the problem of the highest good, have necessarily kept in view the teachings of Faith; still they base their solution of it on motives of reason. Their system is neither strictly deontologico-rational, nor yet altogether eudemonistic, but a consistent blending of both. The ultimate end of man is to be placed in perfect rational activity, in ultimate perfection, and in <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, not as in three different things, but as in one and the self-same, since the three conceptions are resolvable into one another, and each of them denotes a goal of human tendency, a limit beyond which no desire remains to be satisfied. Though they differ somewhat in their several ways of formulating it, at bottom they all agree:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>that in the blissful possession of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is to be found the rightful object of reason (man's deontologico-rational end), and of <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a> (his eud&aelig;monistic end);</li><li>that this eud&aelig;monistic end &#151; the perfect satisfaction of the will in the possession of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; is not merely an accidental result of the former, but is the positive determination of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the author of our nature;</li><li>that this eud&aelig;monistic end may not be intended by the will for its own sake, to the exclusion of the deontologico-rational end, which, by its nature, it presupposes, and to which it is subordinated.</li></ul></div>

<p>It is <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> who best harmonized this system with <a href="13001a.htm">revelation</a>. His teaching may be summarized thus:</p>

<h3>A</h3>

<p>Man's highest <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> does not consist in pleasure, but in action, since, in the nature of things, action is not for pleasure, but pleasure for action. This activity, on which man's <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> rests, must, on the one hand, be the noblest and highest of which his nature is capable, and, on the other, it must be directed toward the noblest and the highest object.</p>

<h3>B</h3>

<p>This noblest and highest object of human activity is not that of the will, which merely follows upon and is conditioned by <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; it must rather be <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself. Consequently, the highest <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of man consists in the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the highest <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. With the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> must, of course, be joined the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; but this <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> is not the essential element of perfect <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>; it is merely a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> complement of it (Summa Theol., I-II, Q. iii, a. 2, c; Con. Gen., III, xxv, xxvi).</p>

<h3>C</h3>

<p>Since the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> can be acquired in three ways &#151; by demonstration, by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and by <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> &#151; the further question arises: which of these three kinds of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the foundation of man's highest <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>? Not <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by demonstration, for <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> must be something universal and attainable by all men, whereas only a few can arrive at this <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by demonstration; neither can <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> be a basis for perfect <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, seeing that this consists chiefly in the activity of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, whilst in <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> the will claims for itself the principal part, inasmuch as the will must here determine the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> to give its assent. Consequently <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> can consist only in the <a href="02364a.htm">intuitive knowledge of God</a>; and since this is attainable only in the next life, it follows that the ultimate destiny of man &#151; and hence his highest good &#151; reaches beyond time into <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>. It must be everlasting, otherwise it would not be perfect (Con. Gent., III, xxxviii, sqq.).</p>

<h3>D</h3>

<p>This end is not merely a subjective one which the reason imposes upon itself. Just because it is an activity, it involves relation to some external object. The <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> essentially represents a <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> distinct from itself, as the act of the will is an inclination towards some good not identical with itself, The <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> to be represented, therefore, and the good to be attained or possessed, are objects to which <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> refers as to further ends, just as the image has reference to a model and motion to a goal. Truth, therefore, and good are objective ends to which formal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> corresponds as a subjective end. The absolutely ultimate end, therefore, is in the objective order, beyond which nothing remains to be known and desired, and which, when it is known and possessed, gives rest to the rational faculties. This can be nothing else than the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> good, which is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, Hence the system is not a purely deontologico-rational one, constituting the reason a law to itself, the observance of which law would be the highest good.</p>

<h3>E</h3>

<p>Still less is it purely eud&aelig;monistic, since the ultimate end and highest good does not coincide with subjective <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> as <a href="07187a.htm">Hedonism</a> teaches, but with the object of the highest acts of contemplation and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. This object is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, not merely as beatifying us, but as the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a> Truth and Goodness, <a href="08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect in itself.</p>
