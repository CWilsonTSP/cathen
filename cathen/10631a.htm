<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF MUNICH-FREISING (MONASENSIS ET FRISINGENSIS).</p>

<p>An archdiocese in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. This archdiocese originated in the ancient Diocese of Freising. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Freising dates back to <a href="04356a.htm">St. Corbinian</a>, who, after his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> came in 716 to organize the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. On a mountain near Freising the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> erected a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. He was succeeded in the government of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> by his brother Erembert. When <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> in 738 regulated <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> by the creation of four <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, Erembert was chosen first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Freising, which see was made suffragan to <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. The sanctuary of <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, which existed on the mountain near Freising before the coming of <a href="04356a.htm">St. Corbinian</a>, became the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and was served by the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. At the time the diocese embraced the country of the Upper Isar as far east as the Inn and south to the watershed of the Inn and the Isar. The third <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Joseph of <a href="15360a.htm">Verona</a> (747-64), established a collegiate church in Isen, and shared in the founding of the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of Sch&auml;ftlarn and Scharnitz, placing the government of the latter in the hands of Abbot Atto. The last-named foundation was particularly significant, in view of the later acquisitions of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the Pustertal.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Other important <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> were Tegernsee, Moosburg, Ilmm&uuml;nster, Altom&uuml;nster, Schliersee, and Rot-on-the-Inn. The learned Aribo, or Arbeo (764-84), the biographer of <a href="04356a.htm">St. Corbinian</a>, translated the remains of this saint from Mais to Freising and <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> them in the <em>Sepulchrum Corbiniani</em> which he had built (765-68) in the church of Our Lady. During his episcopate, Duke Tassilo II presented Innichen to the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Scharnitz. With the newly acquired territory, Freising gained a port of entry into Carinthia, and the diocese soon acquired possessions also in <a href="14318a.htm">Styria</a> and Carniola. Atto, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Scharnitz, also <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Freising (784-810), <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> undertook the task of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianizing</a> the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of the Pustertal. On the summit of the mountain upon which Freising <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> stood he erected a second <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> under the same government as the first. During his time, the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was made suffragan to Salzburg. Hitto (811-34) made a visitation of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; he installed a <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a> and church on the mountain and six secular canons in the church on the mountain Weihenstephan near Freising.</p>

<p>During the episcopate of his successor Erchambert (835-54), a deed of gift for the first time mentions <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, who were not <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> (842 and 845), the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter being thereafter composed of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and canons. Under Bishops Anno, (855-75), Arnold (875-83), and Waldo (883-903), brother of Bishop Salomo of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, the monastic element in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter gradually withdrew; the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> mountain seem to have abandoned it and to have established themselves at the foot of the Weihenstephan. Waldo rebuilt the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had been burned down; he was given <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the neighbouring Abbey of Moosburg, and received from Louis the Child in 906 the right of free choice of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter.</p>

<p>The Hungarians gained an entry into <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and destroyed almost entirely the spiritual life of the country. Bishop Utto fell in a battle against them in 908. Under St. Lantpert (938-57), Freising was set on fire by the Hungarians and almost entirely destroyed. After the victory of <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a> at Lechfeld, peace came again to the city, and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Freising, under the guidance of competent rulers, rose from its ruins, and acquired new possessions. Abraham, of the race of the counts of <a href="06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a> (956-94), obtained for his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> from the Emperor <a href="11355a.htm">Otto II</a> (973) extensive possessions in Carniola. Gottschalk, Knight of Hagenau (994-1006), obtained for Freising a <a href="11152a.htm">coinage</a>, the privilege of holding fairs, and civic <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>; and Egilbert of Moosburg (1006-39), the founder of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Weihenstephan, which replaced the old <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the canons, was the recipient of additional lands in Upper Carniola. In <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and in the Tyrol the colonies founded from the diocese were remarkably successful in development and stability. During the disturbances resulting from the <a href="08084c.htm">conflict of investitures</a>, Ellenhard, Count of Meran (1052-78), was ever to be found on the side of <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>, who repeatedly visited the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in Freising; Meginhard, Count of Scheyern (1078-98), who distinguished himself by spreading the <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, was more favourable to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; Heinrich I, of Ebersdorf (1098-1137), was in his turn an adherent of the emperor. Heinrich I lived to see the destruction of Freising by Duke Welf, and, when dying, bequeathed his possessions to the diocese.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>He was succeeded by the most distinguished <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a> (1137-58), the historian and <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. He saved the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> from the ruin which threatened it, reestablished many <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and delivered the diocese from the oppressive <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the counts of Scheyern. A <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> himself, he once more established monastic discipline and austerity. In the last years of his administration occurred the destruction of the episcopal bridge, custom houses, mint, and salt works near Oberf&ouml;hring by Duke Henry the Lion, who transferred the custom houses and bridge site to the upper part of Oberf&ouml;hring, placing them in the village of Munich on the Isar. Albert I (1158-84) brought the diocese safely through the conflicts of <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; he rebuilt the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which had been burned down in 1169, making it larger and more magnificent; his successor <a href="11355a.htm">Otto II</a> (1184-1220) completed the work, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> being <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1205. The troubled period of the thirteenth century was generally unfavourable to the spiritual life of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; in addition, the acquisition of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> through donation ceased altogether, and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in particular Konrad of Wittelsbach (1258-1278) and Emicho of Wittslebach (1283-1311), organized and brought together their scattered possessions by purchase, sale, and exchange. By inheriting Werdenfels (1294), the diocese became an immediate principality of the empire.</p>

<p>The <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> which occurred under Louis the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> also divided the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Freising. In opposition to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> chosen by the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, which was favourable to the emperor, three others were named in succession by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and for more than a century afterwards the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> appointed the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, ignoring the privilege of free choice possessed by the chapter. Under the rule of Bishop Albert of Hohenberg (1349-59), chancellor of Charles IV, the diocese recovered from the <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> effects produced by the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. His successors were in great part lords from <a href="02121b.htm">Austrian</a> territory. In opposition to Bishop Nicodemus of Scala (1421-43), named by <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, who proved himself an excellent regent and promoter of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter chose the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Johann Gr&uuml;nwalder, recognized by the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, and by Duke Albert of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; but after the resignation of Heinrich II of Schlick (1443-48), appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, he obtained general recognition as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and showed himself to be eminently fitted for the office (1448-52). His successor, Johann IV of T&uuml;lbeck (1453-73), was the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in many years to owe his election to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. He resigned in favour of his chancellor, the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> Sixtus of Tannberg, who worked <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> for reform and for the maintenance of <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. During his time, <a href="01751a.htm">Veit Arnpeck</a> wrote his history of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and of Freising.</p>

<p>After the death of Sixtus, the chapter elected in succession three brothers of the house of Wittelsbach: Ruprecht (1495-98), Philipp (1499-1541), and Heinrich (1541-1551); of these, however, only Philipp received <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Given up to field sports, Philipp nevertheless steadfastly opposed the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> innovations which seemed about to gain it footing in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Philipp was also administrator of the Diocese of Naumburg. Under Bishop Leo (1552-59), a visitation of the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> took place. Moritz of Sandizell (1599-1666), an admirable administrator, resigned in favour of Duke Ernest of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1556-1612). The latter was at the same time <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, of <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, Elector of Cologne, and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>. On account of his <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> activity in the North German sees, he was unable to remain long at Freising. Nevertheless he introduced many reforms, established a ducal and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> town council in Munich, and <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the first <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> concordat (1583). Under the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> Vitus Adam von Gebeck (1618-51), the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was shockingly devastated by the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>. Emperor Ferdinand II conferred upon him and his successors the dignity of Prince-bishops.</p>

<p>Once more two princes of the house of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> were elected to the See of Freising: Albert Sigismund (1652-85), at the same time <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and Provost of <a href="05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, an art-loving prince, who adorned the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> with a magnificent portal; and Joseph Klemens (1685-94), brother of the Elector Max Emanuel, an ostentatious and extravagant prince, also <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Elector of Cologne, and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. Papal confirmation of his appointment to the last named see was given only in the event that he should resign from the Sees of Freising and <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. In Freising he was succeeded by Johann von Kapfing (1695-1727), who caused the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to be decorated by the Asam brothers, erected a number of <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, made numerous visitations, and founded a lyceum at Freising, one of the professors being the learned <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Meichelbeck, who wrote the history of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Freising. Johann Theodor, Duke of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1727-63), in whose hands were united the Dioceses of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and Freising, built an <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> at Munich (1735). Klemens Wenceslaus of Saxony (1763-68), who from 1764 was also <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and coadjutor of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, resigned the See of Freising when, in 1768, he was chosen Elector of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Ludwig Joseph von Welden (1769-88) was especially distinguished for his erection of <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for the people. During his episcopate, a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> nunciature for the lands of Elector Karl Theodor was established in Munich (1786), which was the immediate cause of the convoking of the Congress of Ems. Maximilian Prokop, Count of T&ouml;rring-Jettenbach (1788-89), was succeeded by the last Prince-Bishop of Freising, Joseph Konrad von Schroffenberg (1780-1803), the dissolution of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> taking place during his lifetime (d. 4 April, 1803, at Berchtesgaden).</p>

<p>At the time of the secularization of <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>, the prince-bishopric fell to <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the parts lying in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and the Tyrol being turned over to Salzburg. The reformers undertook the destruction of <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and diocese, numerous churches were sold for the material they contained, graves were <a href="04748c.htm">desecrated</a>, the <a href="01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> were sold at auction or melted down, and the most valuable <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a> were despoiled of their treasures. Owing to the dissolution of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter by the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Government, the election of a <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> was impossible, and the spiritual guidance of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was entrusted to the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Heckenstaller, appointed from <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, who, in 1819, was named <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the abandoned diocese. The most important episcopal functions were performed by the coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Johann Nepomuk von Wolf. After the concordat between <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and King Max Joseph I (5 June, 1817), an orderly condition of affairs was again finally inaugurated. From the territory of the dissolved Sees of Freising and Chiemsee, and the former Provostship of Berchtesgaden was created the Archdiocese of Munich-Freising, with the seat of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter in Munich. The new archdiocese was also to comprise those portions of the former Prince-Bishopric of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> which lay on the left bank of the Inn. On the other hand, those <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Tyrol, Carinthia, Carniola, etc., which were formerly under the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Freising and Chiemsee, were subjected to the Ordinaries of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and <a href="02793d.htm">Brixen</a>. The church of Our Lady in Munich was made the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The Bishops of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a>, and <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> became the suffragans of the new <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. The <a href="03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of circumscription, "Dei ac Domini nostri," bears the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of 1 April, 1818.</p>

<p>Lothar Anselm, Freiherr von Gebsattel, dean of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> and a personal friend of the king, was named the first <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (1817). As, at the same time as the publication of the concordat, a <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> edict had been <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> as part of the constitution, which again unfairly abrogated many of the stipulations of the concordat, Gebsattel refused to take the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to abide by the constitution; and it was only after the Tegernsee proclamation of the king, 15 Sept., 1821, that he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Munich (1821). He attained great distinction by his regulation of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. Under his rule, a large number of <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were re-established or newly founded, and many <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> were erected. In Freising, on the site of the old episcopal residence, which Louis had restored to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1826, an <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> was established, to which were added later a lesser <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, a gymnasium, and a lyceum.</p>

<p>His successor was <a href="12730c.htm">Karl August, Count of Reisach</a>, previously <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>, and coadjutor of Munich. He became unpopular under Maximilian II because of his efforts to uphold the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The king finally used his infl&uuml;nce to have him withdrawn, and <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1855 raised him to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> and called him to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Gregor von Scherr (1856-77), former <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Metten, endeavoured to preserve the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> character of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. For the maintenance of the lesser <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> which had been <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to receive an exceptionally large number of candidates to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, he founded <a href="04356a.htm">St. Corbinian's</a> Association, and erected a lesser <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Freising. He introduced into his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> the devotion of the Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and instituted pastoral conferences of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. At the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, he voted with the minority, but submitted at once to the decision of the council. The last years of his episcopate were embittered by the support which the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Government, under the leadership of Lutz, minister of worship, gave to the Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement, whose founder (<a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>) and most <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> champions were resident in Munich.</p>

<p>His successor, Anton von Steichele (1878-89), the learned church historian and historiographer of the <a href="02073b.htm">Diocese of Augsburg</a>, by the foundation of Church Building Associations kept pace with the ever-growing City of Munich by the erection of new churches and <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and enlarged the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Freising. In January, 1887, he summoned the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> to a conference at Freising, which resulted in a resolution to send to the Government a joint memorandum in regard to the status of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, which when carried into effect brought about a better arrangement of the relations between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> and guaranteed to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> a greater infl&uuml;nce upon the intermediate and higher <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. Under Archbishop Antonius von Thoma (1889-97), the Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> question was finally settled in a manner favourable to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and to <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. Franz Joseph von Stein (1897-1909) fearlessly espoused in the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Chamber of the Council of the Empire the cause of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> regarding instruction, upholding <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as opposed to the unchecked freedom of <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> teaching. In accordance with the requirements of the times, he bestowed special care upon the encouragement of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> orders and associations, the fostering of <a href="03592a.htm">Christian charity</a>, the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the awakening and conservation of the spirit of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the hearts of the people. The present <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is Franz Bettinger, appointed on 23 May, 1909, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 15 Aug.</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The archdiocese comprises the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> district of Upper <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, excepting those portions lying west and north of the Danube, 48 communes in the domains of Landshut, and Vilsbiburg in the district of Lower <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.

In addition to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, there are three collegiate churches: in Munich (St. Cajetan's), Laufen, and Tittmoning.</p>

<p>For the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> there are lesser <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> in Scheyern (conducted by the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>) and in Freising, having respectively 175 and 215 students, as well as two <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>, viz., the <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Freising, with 171 students, and the Georgianum, founded in 1494 by Duke Georg the Rich at <a href="08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, now transferred to Munich and administered by the State, with 103 students, of which, however, only 23 belong to the Diocese of Munich-Freising. The students attend the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> lectures at the University of Munich and at the state lyceums at Freising.</p>

<p>The following orders are represented in the archdiocese: &#151; The <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> possess the two Abbeys of Scheyern and St. Boniface in Munich, founded by King Louis I, as well as the Abbeys of Ettal and Sch&auml;ftlarn, and 2 colleges for students in Munich, &#151; in all (1910) 91 fathers, 27 scholastics, and 162 brothers.

<p>Numerous <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> orders and congregations are to be found in the archdiocese. Of the ancient <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> only a few are still in existence, notably the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of the Island of Fra&uuml;nchiemsee, with an <a href="13554b.htm">educational establishment</a> and 72 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>, and the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="09750a.htm">Servites</a>, near the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> church of the ducal <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> in Munich, with 55 sisters. The recent congregations are occupied entirely with the instruction of girls, with the care of the sick and the <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a>, with the management of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions, and so on, while the <a href="02785a.htm">Brigittines</a> and the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> give themselves up to contemplation.</p>

<p>Of the associations in the archdiocese, the following, more or less widespread, may be named: Ludwigmissionsverein (Louis missionary union), the Association of the Holy Childhood of Jesus, the <a href="13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, St. Elizabeth's Guild, the Archconfraternity of the Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <em>Gesellenvereine</em> (Journeymen's Unions) and <em>Arbeitervereine</em> (Unions of Labourers), <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Students' Unions, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Associations for the Young, Unions of Clerks and Employees, Servants' Unions, Associations for the Education of Neglected Children, and so forth.</p>

<p>Of the churches of the archdiocese, those of the city of Munich are especially noteworthy; this is so in particular of the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Our Lady, a brick building in the <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, which dates, from 1468-88, with two towers 324 ft. in height, whose copper <a href="04569d.htm">cupolas</a>, the so-called "w&auml;lschen Kappen" (Romanesque caps), are the town's most famous landmarks. Other churches are St. Peter's, the oldest <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church of the city, dating from the year 1180, built in the Gothic and later restored in the Baroque style; Sankt Jacob am Anger, the oldest church in Munich, still retaining its original form and <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the thirteenth century; the court <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Michael, built for the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, 1583-97, the most distinguished <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> production of the German <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>; the court <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Cajetan, built (1663-75) for the <a href="14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, in the Baroque style; the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Louis, built (1830-44), mainly through the generosity of King Louis I, in <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> Italian style, containing the famous fresco of the "Last Judgment" by <a href="04376a.htm">Cornelius</a>; the court of All Saints, built in 1827-37 in the Romanesque-Byzantine style; and the Basilica of St. Boniface, built (1835-50) for the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, in the form of an early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> basilica, containing frescoes taken from the life of <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. The numerous churches of the most varied styles which have been erected in Munich during the last ten years, and constitute one of the beauties of the city, e.g., those of St. Anna, St. Paul, St. Joseph, St. Rupert, bear witness to the people's devotion. Of the other churches of the archdiocese, the following are worthy of mention: the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Freising, built 1161-1205, often restored and altered, in which is to be found the shrine containing the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="04356a.htm">St. Corbinian</a>; the <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Martin in the city of Landshut, dating from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, surmounted by the highest tower in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; in the same city the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Jodock, also in the <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, built in 1338-68; the Romanesque church of Moosburg, erected 1160; the collegiate churches of Tegernsee, Isen, Berchtesgaden, Ilmm&uuml;nster, Dietramszell, and others.

<h2>University of Munich</h2>

<p>It was first established (1472) at <a href="08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a> (q.v. for its history up to 1800). In 1800 it was transferred to Landshut, and, later, by <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of Ludwig I (3 Oct., 1826) to Munich, where it has developed in peace. Its earliest location was the former college of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, but in 1840 it removed to a new building which has recently (1908) been considerably enlarged. Through the munificence of the Wittelsbach dynasty, abundant provision has been made for its organization and equipment, and it now ranks as the second largest among the German <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>.
