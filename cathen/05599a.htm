<p>Bernardo Pignatelli, born in the neighbourhood of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, elected 15 Feb., 1145; d. at <a href="14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, 8 July, 1153. On the very day that <a href="09412a.htm">Pope Lucius II</a> succumbed, either to illness or wounds, the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, foreseeing that the Roman populace would make a determined effort to force the new pontiff to abdicate his temporal power and swear allegiance to the <em>Senatus Populusque Romanus,</em> hastily buried the deceased <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the Lateran and withdrew to the remote <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> of St. C&aelig;sarius on the Appian Way. Here, for reasons unascertained, they sought a candidate outside their body, and unanimously chose the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, Bernard of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Tre Fontane, on the site of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. He was <a href="05479c.htm">enthroned</a> as Eugene III without delay in St. John Lateran, and since residence in the rebellious city was impossible, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and his <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> fled to the country. Their rendezvous was the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="05785d.htm">Farfa</a>, where Eugene received the episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The city of <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, the hospitable refuge of so many of the afflicted <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, opened its gates to welcome him; and thither he proceeded to await developments. Though powerless in face of the Roman mob, he was assured by embassies from all the <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> powers that he possessed the sympathy and affectionate homage of the entire <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Concerning the parentage, birth-place, and even the original name of Eugene, each of his biographers has advanced a different opinion. All that can be affirmed as certain is that he was of the noble <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Pignatelli, and whether he received the name of Bernardo in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> or only upon entering religion, must remain uncertain. He was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and after his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> was made a canon of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Later he held the office of <em>vice-dominus</em> or steward of the temporalities of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1130 he came under the magnetic influence of <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a>; five years later when the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> returned home from the Synod of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, the <em>vice dominus</em> accompanied him as a <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a>. In course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> he was employed by his order on several important affiars; and lastly was sent with a colony of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> to repeople the ancient <a href="05785d.htm">Abbey of Farfa</a>; but <a href="08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> placed them instead at the Tre Fontane.</p>

<p>St. Bernard received the intelligence of the elevation of his disciple with astonishment and pleasure, and gave expression to his feelings in a paternal letter addressed to the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, in which occurs the famous passage so often quoted by reformers, <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>: "Who will grant me to see, before I die, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church of God</a> as in the days of old when the Apostles let down their nets for a draught, not of silver and gold, but of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>?" The saint, moreover, proceeded to compose in his few moments of leisure that admirable handbook for <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> called "De Consideratione". Whilst Eugene sojourned at <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, <a href="01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>, who had been condemned by the Council of 1139 to exile from <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, ventured to return at the beginning of the new pontificate and threw himself on the clemency of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Believing in the sincerity of his repentance, Eugene absolved him and enjoined on him as penance <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> and a visit to the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. If the veteran demagogue entered <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in a penitential mood, the sight of democracy based on his own principles soon <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to revert to his former self. He placed himself at the head of the movement, and his incendiary philippics against the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and even the ascetic pontiff who treated him with extreme lenity, worked his hearers into such fury that <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> resembled a city captured by barbarians. The palaces of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and of such of the nobility as held with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> were razed to the ground; churches and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were pillaged; St. Peter's church was turned into an arsenal; and <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> were plundered and maltreated.</p>

<p>But the storm was too violent to last. Only an idiot could fail to understand that <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> without he <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had no means of subsistence. A strong party was formed in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the vicinity consisting of the principal <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> and their adherents, in the interests of order and the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and the democrats were induced to listen to words of moderation. A treaty was entered into with Eugene by which the Senate was preserved but subject to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> sovereignty and swearing allegiance to the <a href="12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>. The senators were to be chosen annually by popular election and in a committee of their body the executive power was lodged. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the senate should have separate courts, and an appeal could be made from the decisions of either court to the other. By virtue of this treaty Eugene made a solemn entry into <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> a few days before <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, and was greeted by the fickle populace with boundless enthusiasm. But the dual system of government <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> unworkable. The Romans demanded the destruction of <a href="14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>. This town had been faithful to Eugene during the rebellion of the Romans and merited his protection. He therefore refused to permit it to be destroyed. The Romans growing more and more turbulent, he retired to Castel S. Angelo, thence to <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, and finally crossed the Alps, early in 1146.</p>

<p>Problems lay before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> of vastly greater importance than the maintenance of order in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> principalities in Palestine and <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> were threatened with extinction. The fall of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> (1144) had aroused consternation throughout the West, and already from <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> Eugene had addressed a stirring appeal to the <a href="03691a.htm">chivalry</a> of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> to hasten to the defence of the Holy Places. St. Bernard was commissioned to preach the <a href="04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a>, and he acquitted himself of the task with such success that within a couple of years two magnificent armies, commanded by the King of the Romans and the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, were on their way to Palestine. That the <a href="04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a> was a wretched failure cannot be ascribed to the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> or the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; but it is one of those phenomena so frequently met with in the history of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, that a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> who was made to subdue a handful of rebellious subjects could hurl all <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> against the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. Eugene spent three busy and fruitful years in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, intent on the propagation of the Faith, the correction of <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> and abuses, and the maintenance of discipline. He sent Cardinal Breakspear (afterwards <a href="01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>) as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to Scandinavia; he entered into relations with the Orientals with a view to reunion; he proceeded with vigour against the nascent <a href="09591a.htm">Manichean heresies</a>. In several <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> (Paris, 1147, Trier, 1148), notably in the great <a href="12730a.htm">Synod of Reims</a> (1148), canons were enacted regarding the dress and conduct of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. To ensure the strict execution of these canons, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who should neglect to enforce them were threatened with suspension. Eugene was inexorable in punishing the unworthy. He deposed the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of York and <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and he for a cause which St. Bernard thought not sufficiently grave, he withdrew the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>. But if the saintly pontiff could at times be severe, this was not his natural disposition.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>"Never", wrote Ven. Peter of Cluny to St. Bernard, "have I found a truer friend, a sincerer brother, a purer father. His ear is ever ready to hear, his tongue is swift and mighty to advise. Nor does he comport himself as one's superior, but rather as an equal or an inferior&hellip; I have never made him a request which he has not either granted, or so refused that I could not reasonably complain." On the occasion of a visit which he paid to Clairvaux, his former companions discovered to their <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> that "he who externally shone in the pontifical robes remained in his heart an observant <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>".</p>

<p>The prolonged sojourn of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> was of great advantage to the French Church in many ways and enhanced the prestige of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Eugene also encouraged the new <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement to which <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> had given a strong impulse. With the aid of <a href="12563a.htm">Cardinal Pullus</a>, his chancellor, who had established the <a href="11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a> on a lasting basis, he reduced the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and philosophy to better form. He encouraged Gratian in his herculean task of arranging the <a href="04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, and we owe to him various useful regulations bearing on academic degrees. In the spring of 1148, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> returned by easy stages to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. On 7 July, he met the <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the canons of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> for <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and solemnly <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>, who still reigned over the Roman mob. Eugene, having brought with him considerable financial aid, began to gather his vassals and advanced to <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> and thence to Tusculum. Here he was visited by King Louis of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, whom he reconciled to his queen, Eleanor. With the assistance of Roger of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, he forced his way into <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1149), and celebrated <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a> in the Lateran. His stay was not of long duration. During the next three years the Roman court wandered in exile through the Campagna while both sides looked for the intervention of Conrad of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, offering him the imperial crown. Aroused by the earnest exhortations of St. Bernard, Conrad finally decided to descend into <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and put an end to the <a href="01452a.htm">anarchy</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Death overtook him in the midst of his preparations on 15 Feb., 1152, leaving the task to his more energetic nephew, <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>. The envoys of Eugene having concluded with Frederick at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, in the spring of 1153, a treaty favourable to the interests of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the empire, the more moderate of the Romans, seeing that the days of democracy were numbered, joined with the nobles in putting down the Arnoldists, and the pontiff was enabled to spend his concluding days in peace.</p>

<p>Eugene is said to have gained the affection of the people by his affability and generosity. He died at <a href="14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, whither he had gone to avoid the summer heats, and was buried in front of the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a> in St. Peters, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. St. Bernard followed him to the grave (20 Aug.). "The unassuming but astute pupil of St. Bernard", says Gregorovius, "had always continued to wear the coarse habit of Clairvaux beneath the purple; the stoic virtues of monasticism accompanied him through his stormy career, and invested him with that power of passive resistance which has always remained the most effectual weapon of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>." <a href="01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> pronounces Eugene III "one of the greatest and most afflicted of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>". <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> by a decreed of 28 Dec., 1872, approved the cult which from time immemorial the <a href="12110a.htm">Pisans</a> have rendered to their countryman, and ordered him to be <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> with <a href="09790b.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="11219a.htm">Office</a> <em>ritu duplici</em> on the <a href="10709a.htm">anniversary of his death</a>.</p>
