<p>German town and <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a> [now Rhineland-Palatine --<em>Ed.</em>]; formerly the seat of an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and elector.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3 id="A">Until the suppression of the former archdiocese</h3>

<p>Near the site of the modern Mainz there existed some centuries before the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> era a Celtic settlement. Here, about 38 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, Agrippa established a Roman camp (<em>Moguntiacum</em>), which, under Drusus, became the centre of the Roman province of Upper Germany. About the camp gradually developed a considerable town. According to <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>, whose statement received valuable corroboration from the excavations of 1907-8, Mainz possessed a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community in the second century. Crescentius, whom legend identifies with the disciple of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, is mentioned as first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> before <a href="02656a.htm">Boniface</a>, however, little is <a href="08673a.htm">known</a>. Bothardus built a <a href="02325a.htm">basilica</a> in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="11069c.htm">St. Nicomedes</a>; Riuthardus was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, when the Alamannian prince Rando sacked the town in 368, and Bishop Aureus was <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the Alamannian Crocus in 406. In 451 Mainz was pillaged by the Huns. Under the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> domination the town began again to prosper. Bishop Sidonius, who lived early in the sixth century, restored the old churches and built new ones. The <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king Dagobert surrounded Mainz with walls and established his residence there. Under him the Altm&uuml;nsterkloster was erected by St. Bithildis. Bishop Gerold, who fell in battle against the Saxons, was succeeded in 743 by his son Gewilio.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular importance of Mainz may fitly be dated from the accession of <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. Strictly speaking, however, Mainz was not then raised to <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank; <a href="02656a.htm">Boniface</a> was himself an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> as formerly, before he occupied any see in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but the <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> dignity did not descend immediately to his successor, St. Lul or Lullus. The long quarrel between Lullus and the Monastery of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> ended in the complete exemption of the latter from the episcopal authority. Lullus thereupon built the Monastery of Hersfeld, in which he was later buried. In 780 or 782 Mainz was elevated to <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank. The <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of L&uuml;ttuck, <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Worms, <a href="14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, and Utrecht were first made subject to it, together with the <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> of Erfurt, Buraburg, and Eichst&#228;tt, as <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> founded by <a href="02656a.htm">Boniface</a>; then the Swabian <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, and <a href="03743b.htm">Chur</a>. The <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Erfurt and Buraburg, however, lapsed on the death of their first occupants, and in 798 Cologne was made a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="10244c.htm">see</a> with L&#228;ttich and Utrecht among its suffragans (see <a href="04116a.htm">C<font size=-2>OLOGNE</font> </a>). With the spread of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, Halberstadt, <a href="07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, and Verden were, on their erection, added to the suffragans of Mainz, and under Archbishop Willigis the newly-created sees of Prague and Olm&uuml;tz were made subject to it. The <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> then possessed fourteen suffragans, and extended from the Elbe to the Grison Alps and from the Vosges to the Thuringian Saale, thus representing the greatest <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> after the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The actual power of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> over their suffragans was, however, small. Mainz lost Prague and Olm&uuml;tz during the fourteenth century, and Halberstadt and Verden through the Peace of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. In 1752 the addition of the newly-created <a href="06313b.htm">Diocese of Fulda</a> raised the number of suffragans to eleven.</p>

<p>Among the immediate successors of Lullus, Archbishop Richulf (787-813), who built the Monastery of <a href="01252b.htm">St. Alban</a> (famous for its <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>), and especially <a href="12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> (847-56) deserve mention. Under Liutbert (863-89) the dignity of Archchancellor of the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a> was first associated with Mainz. <a href="07149c.htm">Hatto I</a> (891-913) exercised a great influence on the fortunes of the whole empire. Hildebert (928-37) successfully upheld against Cologne and <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> Mainz's claim to crown the German king. The precedence of Mainz in the German Church was strongly emphasized by Frederick (937-54), when he sought the office of Vicar-Apostolic for <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. William (954-68), natural son of <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, acquired for himself and his successors the office of Archchancellor of the Empire. About Hatto II (968-70) is related the legend of the M&#228;usethurm near Bingen. Willigis (975-1010), who saved the empire from disintegration during the minority of <a href="11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, fostered the commerce of Mainz; he built a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was burned down on the day of its <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and obtained from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the right of presiding over all <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> held within the empire and of crowning the newly-elected king. <a href="01711d.htm">Aribo</a> played the chief r&ocirc;le in the election of Conrad II. Bardo von Oppertshafen (1031-51) completed the new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by Willigis (1037).</p>

<p>In the <a href="08084c.htm">investiture strife</a> the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Mainz, as the foremost spiritual princes of the empire, could not remain neutral. Count Siegfried I von Eppstein (1059-84) espoused the cause of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy law</a> of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> Henry's two rivals, Rudolf of Swabia and Hermann of Luxemburg. Wezilo (1084-8), however, supported the emperor and his <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>. In Ruthard (1089-1109) and Adalbert I von Saarbr&uuml;cken (1109-37) the emperor again found opponents; for his fidelity to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> cause, the latter was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Henry V for three years in the fortress of Trifels, until the citizens of Mainz secured his release by confining the emperor in their town until he guaranteed the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> liberation. In recognition of this assistance, Adalbert granted the town a charter, which was engraved on the bronze doors of the Liebfrauenkirche. At Adalbert's proposal the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to participate in the imperial election was confined to certain princes, the foundation of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of electors being thus laid. The popularity enjoyed by him and his brother and successor Adalbert II (1138-41) was not shared by Arnold von Selenhofen (1153-60), who alienated the good-will of the citizens by his sternness and his taxation to further <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa's</a> campaign against <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> by them in the Monastery of St. Jacob during a riot. To punish the citizens, <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> deprived the city of its charter and levelled its walls. The rebuilding of the fortifications was begun by Conrad von Wittelsbach (1161-77): although appointed by <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, he refused to recognize the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="11515a.htm">Pascal</a>, and had in consequence to fly from his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. Count Christian I von Buch (1165-83) was thereupon named <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>. On his death, Conrad, who had meanwhile become <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, returned to his old see (1183-1200), now supported the emperor, and, at the Diet of Gelnhausen, persuaded the German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to espouse the emperor's cause against <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Count Siegfried II von Eppstein (1200-30) received in 1228 the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to crown the King of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>&mdash;a right retained by Mainz until 1343. Siegfried exhausted the depleted exchequer of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, and burdened the territory with a heavy <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>. His nephew Siegfried III von Eppstein (1230-49), supported <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> against the Swabians, ratified the deposition of the emperor, and <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> two of his rivals. In 1223 the chapter granted him the twentieth part of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenue for the liquidation of the <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> on his swearing in the presence of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to incur no <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> thereafter and to impose no further burdens on the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The canons bound themselves by <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> never to elect an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> who would not take the same <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> as Siegfried. Thus originated the election capitulations, which were later used by the chapter to secure new <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges from the candidates for the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. It was also under Siegfried (1244) that the government of the town passed into the hands of a municipal council elected by the citizens.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As a free town of the empire, the prosperity of Mainz steadily increased, its linen and woollen industries being the most important along the Rhine. It thus became known as the "Golden Mainz". Under its leadership was formed in 1254 the "League of the Rhenish Towns", supported by most of the Rhenish towns and princes. A great <a href="05257a.htm">architectural</a> activity also manifested itself; the glorious <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was then built, and numerous monastic institutions were established. The discovery of printing by <a href="07090a.htm">Gutenberg</a> extended the fame of the town, while the limitation of the right of voting to the seven electors had greatly increased the influence of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. At the end of the interregnum Werner von Eppstein (1259-84) secured the election of Rudolf of Hapsburg, whose support he hoped for against the Landgrave of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>. In the growing power of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, Werner rightly saw the most dangerous menace to the safety of Mainz. Gerhard II von Eppstein (1289-1305) likewise played the chief part in the election of Adolf of Nassau, but, not receiving the expected assistance in his domestic politics, went over with King Wenzel of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> to Adolf's rival, Albert of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Under Peter von Aspelt (1305-20) Mainz attained the pinnacle of its power. In opposition to Count Henry III of Virneburg (1328-46), appointed by <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, the chapter unanimously elected Baldwin of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, who granted to it or confirmed a series of important privileges. It was only on Baldwin's resignation that Henry could enter on his administration, having previously, in order to secure the chapter's recognition, granted it an important influence in the government of the archdiocese. As a partisan of Louis the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, he came into sharp conflict with <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, who separated Prague and Olm&uuml;tz from Mainz (1343), and deposed the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (1346). However, Henry managed to retain the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> until 1353, when Gerlach of Nassau (1346-71), appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, entered into possession. By means of his personal <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> Gerlach greatly increased the power of the archdiocese. On his death Charles IV, fearing to see one of the powerful Nassau <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> in possession of the first see of the empire, secured the appointment of Count John I of Luxemburg in 1371, and of Margrave Louis of <a href="10148b.htm">Meissen</a> in 1375. The chapter, however, unanimously chose Adolf of Nassau, who took possession of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. The fiercely contested <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> which ensued greatly weakened the power of Mainz, and increased the influence of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>. In 1381 an agreement was arrived at, Louis abdicating Mainz. Adolf founded the University of Erfurt in 1389. Conrad II von Weinsberg (1390-6) was succeeded by Adolf's brother, John II (1397-1419), who took a prominent part in the deposition of King Wenzel and the elevation of Rudolf of the Palatinate. Under Conrad von Daun (1419-34) Cardinal Branda, commissioned by <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, investigated the existing election capitulations, which he ordered to be replaced by a capitulation drafted by himself.</p>

<p>The contest between the rival <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, Diether von Isenberg and Adolf II of Nassau (the "Mainzer Stiftsfehde", 1461-3), resulted in great loss of men, money, and territory. To punish the guilds for supporting Diether, Adolf, having captured the town, deprived it of its charter. Diether (1475-82) founded the University of Mainz in 1477, which continued until 1798, but the town never regained its former prosperity. To retrieve the dangerous financial condition of the archdiocese by an alliance with a powerful <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, the chapter petitioned the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1480 to appoint <a href="13504a.htm">Albert of Saxony</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. During his short reign (1482-4) Albert brought Erfurt again into submission. However, even <a href="02520b.htm">Berthold of Henneburg</a> (1484-1504), perhaps the greatest <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Minz, was unable to stem the decline of its <a href="02137c.htm">secular power</a>. Under Jacob von Liebenstein (1504-8) the loss of Erfurt to Saxony seemed imminent. In open opposition to the Saxon house, the chapter chose, on the death of Uriel of Gemmingen (1508-14), <a href="01262a.htm">Albert of Brandenburg</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, although he already held the <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and Halberstadt (see <a href="01262a.htm">A<font size=-2>LBERT OF</font> B<font size=-2>RANDENBURG</font></a> and <a href="06484b.htm">G<font size=-2>ERMANY</font></a>). The indulgent attitude, at first adopted by Albert towards the innovators, allowed the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> to spread fairly widely through the archdiocese which was soon convulsed by this and the <a href="11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a>. In preserving the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, Lorenz Thuchsess von Pommersfelden, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dean, performed ever-memorable services. Albert's reign is also important on account of the administrative reforms introduced by him. Electors Sebastian von Hausenstamm (1545-55) and Daniel Brendel of Homburg (1555-82), strove indefatigably to heal the scars of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; the latter summoned the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to Mainz. Wolfgang von Dalberg (1582-1601), however, gave such lukewarm support to the <a href="04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> that he was suspected of conspiring with the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. In the election capitulation the chapter imposed on his successor, John Adam von Bicken (1601-4), the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of founding a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which, however, he failed to accomplish during his short reign. John Schweickhard von Cronenberg (1604-26) restored the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in Eichsfeld and Bergstrasse, and adjusted the quarrel between Emperor Rudolf and his brother Matthias.</p>

<p>Mainz suffered grievously during the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>. Under George von Greifenklau (1626-9), who had a prominent share in the Restitution Edict, Mainz escaped practically unaffected, but Anselm Casimir von Wambold (1629-45) had to fly before Gustavus Adolphus in 1631. When the imperial troops reoccupied Mainz in 1636, the retiring Swedes committed many atrocities. Frightful ravage was also wrought by the French, when they later occupied the town (1644-8). The very existence, indeed, of the principality seemed threatened, as the Swedes demanded in the peace negotiations the secularization of the archdiocese. Its escape from dissolution was entirely due to the energetic protest of <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and the activity of John Philip von Sch&ouml;nborn (1647-73). As its situation left Mainz most exposed, after Cologne, to French attack, Lothaire Frederick von Metternich-Burscheid (1673-5), to save the archdiocese, adopted a friendly attitude towards <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> during the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> between the emperor and <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. In 1688 his third successor, Anselm Franz von Ingelheim (1679-95), had to surrender Mainz to the French, who were, however, driven out of the town in the following year. Lothaire Francis von Sch&ouml;nborn (1695-1729), who supported the emperor in the War of the Spanish Succession, reorganized the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, founded the Hospital of <a href="13100c.htm">St. Roch</a>, and showed himself a cultivated patron of the arts and <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>. Under him the town enjoyed a return of prosperity, testified even today by the numerous <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil buildings <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from that period.</p>

<p>On the death of Franz Ludwig von Pfalz-Neuburg (1729-32), who was also <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Worms and Breslau and <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Philip Charles von Eltz-Kempenich (1732-43) was elected hastily to forestall the interference of the ruling houses. During the Seven Years' War, which occurred under Freederick Charles von Ostein (1743-63), the archdiocese was laid waste on various occasions. Emmerich Joseph von Breitbach-B&uuml;rresheim (1763-74) associated himself with the "enlightened" movement to found a national German Church, as far as possible independent of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1766 he abolished many holy days, and issued decrees concerning the "reform" of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the accumulation of real <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> in the "dead hand", etc. On the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> in 1773, he employed their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> for the improvement of elementary <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. Frederick Charles Joseph von Erthal (1774-1802), the last Elector of Mainz, laboured at first in the spirit of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, but later, going over to the Enlightened, formally renounced <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and associated himself with <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. During the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> Mainz encountered varying fortunes. In 1792 the Confederation of the German Princes was founded in the town, which, after the first inglorious campaign of the German army, fell into the hands of the French during the same year. Though recovered by the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> in 1793, it was ceded to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by the Treaty of Campo-Formio in 1797, and, after the Peace of Lun&eacute;ville, became the capital of the French Department of Mont Tonnerre. During the negotiations of the Imperial Delegates the elector died on 25 July, 1802. By the Enactment of this assembly of 25 Feb., 1803, the greater part of the electorate was secularized. About five <em>Aemter</em> (administrative districts) remained <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, and were assigned to the coadjutor of the last elector, Theodore von Dalberg, who was named elector, chancellor, <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, and <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> see was transferred to <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Under French rule, Mainz was changed into a simple diocese in Oct., 1802, and made subject to <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, its <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> being confined to that portion of the old archdiocese which lay on the left bank of the Rhine.</p>

<h3 id="B">From the foundation of the modern diocese of Mainz to the present day</h3>

<p>The new diocese corresponded to the Department of Mont Tonnerre, and included portions of the earlier <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Mainz, Worms, <a href="14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, and <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>. Under <a href="04115b.htm">Ludwig Colmar</a> (1802-18) was accomplished the delimitation of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On his death the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which was again under German rule, was left vacant and administered by a <a href="15402a.htm">vicar general</a>. On the reorganization of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, which resulted in the erection of the Ecclesiastical Province of the <a href="15205b.htm">Upper Rhine</a>, the Diocese of Mainz was made conterminous with the Grand Duchy of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, and constituted suffragan of this newly erected province. Joseph Vitus Burg (1830-3), appointed by <a href="12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a>, had taken a prominent part in the negotiations concerning the erection of the new province; he was, however, affected by Josephism, and defended the ordinances (<em>Kirchenpragmatik</em>), which the <a href="15205b.htm">Upper Rhine</a> governments, in opposition to their earlier declarations, imposed on the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, although they had already been condemned by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Burg also entered a very feeble protest when the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, founded by Colmar, was partially suppressed and its <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty transferred to the University of Giessen. On the death of John Jacob Humann (1833-4), Peter Leopold Kaiser (1835-48) found himself greatly hampered by government interference; while in the matter of the reopening of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> his action in parliament was not sufficiently energetic, he opposed unflinchingly the "German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>" movement of the followers of Ronge in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and was in his later years greatly influenced by the <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="09150b.htm">Lennig</a>.</p>

<p>On Kaiser's death the chapter chose Professor Leopold Schmidt of Giessen, but <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> refused to confirm the election on account of the candidate's practically indifferentist religious and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> views. As the chapter, dispensing with a new election, then referred the selection to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> appointed <a href="08629c.htm">Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler</a>, and, after his death, the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was left vacant in consequence of the attitude of the government, the payment of the episcopal dotation was suspended in 1880 and numerous <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> (about one fourth) left without a <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was meanwhile administered by Christopher Monfang. In 1886 an agreement was arrived at, and Paul Leopold Haffner, who had acquired a reputation as a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="01618a.htm">apologist</a>, was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> and <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> colleges were reopened in 1887, and the task of filling the vacant <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> undertaken. In 1895 <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, which devoted themselves to <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and the care of the sick, were readmitted. Haffner was followed by <a href="03004a.htm">Heinrich Br&uuml;ck</a> (1899-1903). The present <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, George Heinrich Maria Kirstein, was elected on 20 Nov., 1903, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 19 March, 1904.</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The present Diocese of Mainz coincides territorially with the Grand Duchy of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, except that three places belong to the <a href="09260a.htm">Diocese of Limburg</a>. Divided into 19 deaneries and 188 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, it possesses 186 <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and beneficiaries, 1 <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, 80 <a href="04570a.htm">curates</a>, 43 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in other positions, 20 on leave or pensioned. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number 372,000; the non-Catholics 830,000. The chapter consists of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dean, 7 canons, 3 <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="12371a.htm">prebendaries</a>; the ordinariate of a <a href="15402a.htm">vicar general</a> and 6 spiritual councillors; the <em>officialit&eacute;</em> of the <em>official</em> and 7 counsellors. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is elected by the chapter from a list of candidates, which must first be submitted to the government. The public authorities may erase the names of the less acceptable candidates, provided that enough be left to render a canonical election possible. The members of the chapter are selected alternately by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the chapter itself. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutions include the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> (8 professors and 50 students); 3 <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> colleges; 4 episcopal boarding-schools and <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. Exclusively <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> high-schools for boys are forbidden by the <a href="07298c.htm">Hessian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and the activity of the <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> orders in instructing girls is very restricted. There are very few houses of the male orders; the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> have 2 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (Mainz and Dieburg) with 12 fathers and 10 brothers; the Brothers of Mercy 1 house with 12 brothers; the Brothers of St. Joseph parent house in Kleinzimmern with 8 brothers; the Schulbr&uuml;der 1 house with a middle <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in Mainz. The <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> orders are: the <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> from the mother-house at <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, 2 houses with 26 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; the English Ladies 7 houses with 165 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters from <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, 3 houses with 27 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="11698b.htm">Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration</a>, 1 house with 35 sister; the Sisters of <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, mother-house at Mainz and 72 filial <a href="04340c.htm">houses</a> with 534 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; the Sisters of the Most Sacred Redeemer from the mother-house at Niederbronn, 19 houses with 66 <a href="11164a.htm">sisters</a>; the Sisters of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, 8 houses with 120 sisters. Among the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organs of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the "Katholik" and the "Archiv f&uuml;r katholisches Kirchenrecht" deserve special mention.</p>

<p>The principal churches of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: the Romanesque Cathedral of St. Martin at Mainz, one of the most interesting monuments for the history of architecture in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; the Early Gothic Church of St. Stephen (1257-1328); the Baroque Ignazkirche (1763-74); the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and late Gothic Liebfrauenkirche at Worms; the basilica of the former <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Seligenstadt (Carlovingian); the former church of the Domicanesses (thirteenth century).</p>
