<p><a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at Tournus in Ardeche, 21 August, 1725; d. at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 21 March, 1805. His father, a master-tiler, wished to make him an architect, but ended by leaving him free to follow his own vocation, and sent him to Lyons to study under Gromdon, father-in-law of the musician Gr&eacute;try. As Gromdon was only a contractor and a picture-dealer and agent, it is hard to see what he could have taught his pupil. Greuze, however, had already attained some skill when he came to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1755, with his picture "P&egrave;re de famille expliquant la Bible &agrave; ses enfants" (A father explaining the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> to his children). His name was at once proposed to the Academy by Sylvestre, and he was received as an associate. The picture, which was purchased by the celebrated amateur La Live de Jully, was exhibited along with a second <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a>, "L'aveugle tromp&eacute;" (The blind man cheated), that same Year. It was a triumph for Greuze. In one day he had become famous in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, though he was only thirty years of age.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Like all artists of his time, he thought it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to travel through <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He set out towards the end of 1755, with the Abb&eacute; Grognot, the celebrated savant and archaeologist. <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Florence, however, do not seem to have exerted any influence on his art. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, he brought back from <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> some <em>sc&egrave;nes de moeurs</em> for the exhibition of 1757, but they were <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> only in costume and name. He soon returned to his <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> style, <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> of <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> and bourgeois life, and from that moment there began for him a wonderful career of success and good fortune. A strange change was then taking place in the French mind &#151; a curious variation, so to say, of the moral temperature. Reason, the critical faculty, and the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> had run riot, and now men felt the need of living the life of the heart. Society, satiated with frivolity and licentiousness, sought repose in a simple, honest life. This it was that made Rousseau's "Julie" and "Emile" so wonderfully popular; it was, in a word, the great moral and religious crisis of the century, it could not but exert an influence on art, and it fell to Greuze to express it in <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a>. In this, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, he was preceded by an artist much greater than he J-B-Sim&eacute;on Chardin whose <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> the "Ecureuse" (1738), the "Pourvoyeuse" the "B&eacute;n&eacute;dicit&eacute;" (1740) are still masterpieces of the homely <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> life. Chardin, too, was an excellent draughtsman, and Greuze was much his inferior in this respect, just as he falls far short of his precursor's tender kindliness and lovable, unpretentious poetry. For Chardin's charming simplicity Greuze substitutes a host of moral aims and edifying thoughts. The interest of pure sympathy which a <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> ought to feel in the model's life was not enough for Greuze, he must mingle with it a strain of anecdote and a concealed lesson. His work is more or less a <a href="11395a.htm">painted</a> sermon; he is ever a preacher. In this respect he resembles Hogarth, whom he is undoubtedly imitated as Rousseau imitated Richardson. The success of Greuse was therefore one of the innumerable forms of the eighteenth-century anglomania.</p>

<p>All this conspired to make him, for some years, the most widely known and most celebrated <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. His art was hailed as the triumph of natural bourgeois virtue over the mythological and immoral <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a> of Boucher. His work was a pleasing return to reality and life as it is. The "Tricoteuse", "Devideuse", and "Jeune fille pleurant son oiseau mort", at the Exhtbition of 1759, carried away the public with a new feeling of life, an emotion that unexpectedly arose from the most commonplace scenes. The "Accordee de village", exhibited in 1761, raised popular enthusiasm to the highest pitch. The picture marked an epoch. It had the distinction hitherto unheard of for a picture, that the scene it presented furnished the subject of a play at the "Com&eacute;die Italienne" the climax of this play was the <a href="02537c.htm">betrothal</a> scene, which was reproduced by the actors exactly as it was <a href="11395a.htm">painted</a> by Greuze. This compliment, in the present writer's opinion, contains a most delicate piece of criticism. For the artist's main fault is that he betrays his effort to lecture the public. Nature never presents these ready-made scenes, where the lesson is plainly written; some artifice is requisite to draw it out. Greuze is no less conventional than Boucher, while he lacks his power of description and his brilliant <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Instead of the grand opera, which is saved by its lyricism we are disappointed at finding only the comic opera. The <em>naturel</em> of Greuze is that "Rose et Colas", the "D&eacute;serteur" or the "Devin de village". His <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> all resemble one of Sedaine's little dramas suddenly stopped in the midst of a performance.</p>

<p>In addition, his notion of morality is always uncertain or equivocal or, rather, he confuses morality and pleasure, which always ruins his best work. The <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, that virtue is pleasure, that the virtuous man is the one who really enjoys himself, that beneficence is to be measured by the intensity of the emotion it causes in him who practises it, all these conceptions of a well-defined epicurism and a philanthropy identified with egotism, are the most commonplace and silly moral platitudes, for which the age of "philosophy" is responsible. This coarse sensualism and affected sentimentalism, with which the literature of the day was replete, infected Greuze. Despite the innocent appearance of his art, it is quite as reprehensible as that of Boucher and his son-in-law Baudoin, whose charming elegance he does not possess. The eroticism of the eighteenth century had changed only on outward appearance. With all its bourgeois prudish airs, Greuze's <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a> is full of lascivious hints and equivocal suggestions. To be convinced of this, one has only to read Diderot's commentaries on the "Cruche cass&eacute;e" or the "Jeune fine qui pleure son oiseau mort". But this did not impede the success of Greuze or diminish his renown. His <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a>, engraved by Flipart, Massart, <a href="06335a.htm">Gaillard</a>, and Levasseur, continued to be most popular, and brought him a fortune. Meanwhile, although it was customary for artists admitted by the Academy as associates to present a picture to the Society within six months, ten years had passed, and Greuze had not fulfilled this <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Finally, in 1769, he offered his "Septime Sev&egrave;re reprochant &agrave; Caracalla d'avoir voulou l'assassiner" (Septimus Severus reproaching <a href="03328c.htm">Caracalla</a>). This <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a>, which may be seen in the Louvre, met with a very cold reception. Greuze, who expected it would gain him membership in the Academy as an historical <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a>, was received only as a <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> of genre. Proud, like all self-taught men, and spoiled, moreover, by his triumphal career, the artist could not pardon the Academy for this humiliation which he attributed to the <a href="08326b.htm">envy</a> of his fellow-painters, From that time he ceased to work for the exhibitions and contented himself with displaying his works in his studio, whither the public continued to go to see them, as they went to see Rousseau in his fifth-floor room in the rue Pl&acirc;tri&egrave;re. Among others, Mme Roland, then Mlle Phlipon, visited him twice in 1777.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As successful as ever, Greuze went on to produce some of his most renowned works, the "B&eacute;n&eacute;diction" and the "Mal&eacute;diction paternelle", the "Mort du bon p&egrave;re de famille" and the "Mort de p&egrave;re d&eacute;natur&eacute;". He intended to <a href="11395a.htm">paint</a> a suite of twenty pictures, a moral romance, "Bazile et Thibaut" or "Deux &eacute;ducations", showing the lives of good and bad. But this plan was not carried into execution. At length <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> days were approaching for Greuze. His fame never recovered completely from the check it received at the Academy. Differences with his wife, which led to a painful separation, created for him a <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> situation. The preacher of the joys of <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> life became, in the midst of his domestic troubles, all object of derision or of pity to the populace. Younger <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a>, like Fragonard, surpassed him in his own style; their sentiment and form were freer than his, and their execution much superior. Lastly, for some years, public taste had been changing. The wind blew in another direction. The <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="15650a.htm">Winckelmann</a> were becoming diffused. The enthusiasm for antiquity, stirred up by excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii, disgusted the public with the divinities of Boucher and the bourgeoisie of Greuze. Diderot, who had lauded the latter so highly, began to abandon him. "I no longer care for Greuze", he wrote in 1769. Everything foreshadowed the movement that was to culminate in the artistic Jacobinism of David. From the "Mort de Socrate" (1784) of this <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a>, which is the manifesto of the new <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, Greuze was intellectually dead. The <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> was the finishing blow to his renown. His last works show him trying to fall in with the new <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>; they are a curious compromise between his style and that of Prudhon and the Directory. One of his last <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> was the portrait of the <a href="10687a.htm">First Consul Bonaparte</a>, now preserved at <a href="15366a.htm">Versailles</a>. Ruined by the mismanagement of his affairs and the treachery of his wife, abandoned by his clientele, deserted by the public, the old man would have fallen into the most abject poverty but for the help he received from one of his daughters. He used to say to Fragonard: "I am seventy-five years old, I have been working for fifty, I earned three hundred thousand francs, and now I have nothing." He died at the age of eighty, in complete oblivion, having survived a world whose idol he was, and whose ideal he expressed most perfectly.</p>

<p>Overpraised in his lifetime, and always popular (on account of his theatrical display and is moralizing literary <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a>), this artist fully merited his <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a>. Though his style was a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> one, he was a brilliant master of it. He represents, perhaps, the bourgeois ideal of art and morality. Of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement that produced the plays of Diderot, Sedaine, and Mercier, the comic opera of Gr&eacute;try and Montigny, his work is all that survives today. And as a <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> of expressive heads, especially of children and young girls, he has left a number of specimens that display the highest artistic gifts. His "Sophie Arnould" (London, Wallace Gallery) and his "Portrait d'inconnue" (Van Horne collection, <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>) are among the most beautiful portraits of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> produced by the French School.</p>
