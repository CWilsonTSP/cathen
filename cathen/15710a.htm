<h2>Notion and characteristics</h2>

<p>The word <em>worship</em> (Saxon <em>weorthscipe</em>, "honour"; from <em>worth</em>, meaning "value", "dignity", "price", and the termination, <em>ship</em>; <a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>cultus</em>) in its most general sense is homage paid to a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> or a thing. In this sense we may speak of hero-worship, worship of the emperor, of <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a>, of the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, even of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>, and especially of the <a href="04529a.htm">Cross</a>. This article will deal with Christian worship according to the following definition: <em>homage paid to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, to <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to His <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, to the beings or even to the objects which have a special relation to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a></em>.</p>

<p>There are several degrees of this worship:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>if it is addressed directly to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, it is superior, absolute, supreme worship, or worship of adoration, or, according to the <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> term, a worship of <em>latria.</em> This sovereign worship is due to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone; addressed to a creature it would become <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</li><li>When worship is addressed only indirectly to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, when its object is the veneration of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, of <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, or of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, it is a subordinate worship dependent on the first, and relative, in so far as it honours the creatures of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for their peculiar relations with Him; it is designated by <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> as the worship of <em>dulia</em>, a term denoting servitude, and implying, when used to signify our worship of distinguished servants of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, that their service to Him is their title to our veneration (cf. Chollet, loc. cit., col. 2407, and <a href="02715b.htm">Bouquillon</a>, <em>Tractatus de virtute religionis</em>, I, <a href="03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, 1880, 22 sq.).</li><li>As the Blessed Virgin has a separate and absolutely supereminent rank among the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, the worship paid to her is called <em>hyperdulia</em> (for the meaning and history of these terms see Suicer, <em>Thesaurus ecclesiasticus</em>, 1728).</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In accordance with these principles it will readily be understood that a certain worship may be offered even to inanimate objects, such as the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>, the Cross of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Crown of Thorns, or even the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> or picture of a saint. There is here no confusion or danger of <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, for this worship is subordinate or dependent. The <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> is <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> because of the link which unites it with the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who is adored or <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a>; while the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> or picture is regarded as having a conventional relation to a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who has a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to our homage &#151; as being a symbol which reminds us of that <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> (see Vacant, <em>Diet de th&eacute;ol. cath.</em>, s.v. <em>Adoration</em>, and authors cited in bibliography; also <a href="01151a.htm">ADORATION</a>; <a href="07636a.htm">IDOLATRY</a>; <a href="07664a.htm">IMAGES</a>; <a href="15459a.htm">DEVOTION TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY</a>).</p>

<p>Interior worship is to be distinguished from exterior worship. the former is not manifested by external acts, but consists in internal adoration; but when this inner sentiment is expressed by words or actions, prostration, genuflexion, the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, or any other gesture, it becomes exterior worship. Again worship is private or public; the former, which may be an act of external worship, is performed unseen by men or seen by only a few; the second is official worship rendered by men assembled for a religious end and forming a religious <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> properly so called. This is not the place to show that Christian worship is a worship at once interior and exterior, public and private. It should be interior, otherwise it would be mere comedy, a purely <a href="11789b.htm">pharisaical</a> worship such as <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> condemned when He told His disciples that they should worship in spirit and the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. But it should not be purely interior worship, as Sabatier, with certain <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and most <a href="04679b.htm">Deists</a>, maintains (Sabatier, <em>Esquisse d'une philosophie de la religion</em>, 1908, 5); for man is not a pure spirit but composed of body and <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, and he should adore <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> not only in his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> but also in his body. This is the justification of all external manifestations of worship &#151; genuflexion, prostration, kneeling, standing, the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, the lifting-up or <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. Furthermore, on the same principle it will readily be understood that, in rendering homage to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> man may have recourse to animate or inanimate creatures (sacrifice of animals, <a href="07716a.htm">incense</a>, lights, flowers, etc.). Neither is it difficult to prove that, since man is a social being, his worship should be public and in common with others. Worship in private or even individual worship in public, is not sufficient. Society as such should also render to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> due to Him. Furthermore, it is natural that men who <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in the same <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and experience towards Him the same sentiments of adoration, gratitude, and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> should assemble to praise and thank Him.</p>

<p>But even if this principle of a natural right did not exist to prove the necessity and legitimacy of a social worship, the fact that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> founded a Church, that is, a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> professing the same <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, obeying the same <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> united with one another by the closest bonds, implies the existence of the same worship. This religious <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> founded by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> should have one and the same worship &#151; "one Lord, one <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. One <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and Father of all" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs5">Ephesians 4:5-6</a>). This <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> represents the entire worship, which should be one, addressed to the same <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by the same <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hence Christian worship is the worship of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the expression of the same <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and exercised under the supervision of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. Thus understood worship depends on the virtue of religion and is the manifestation of that <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Finally, <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> usually connect worship also with the virtue of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>; for worship is not an optional act of the creature; <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is entitled to the worship of intelligent creatures as a matter of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the worship offered to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has a special character which profoundly differentiates it from Jewish worship, for it is the worship of the Trinity, <a href="06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, <a href="14142b.htm">Son</a>, and <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. The worship of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> is directed to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, one, <a href="11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, magnificent, sovereign, King of kings, Lord of lords, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of gods, but without distinction of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. <a href="12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is addressed to Him as the <a href="06608a.htm">living God</a>, the <a href="06608a.htm">Lord God of Israel</a>, the <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob, the <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers, or simply to the <a href="06608a.htm">Lord our God</a>. The formula, <em>to the <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="08261a.htm">Jacob</a></em>, remains in use among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but ordinarily <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is conceived of by <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> under other titles and with another form. In the worship which <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> paid to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> He shows Him to us as the Father. He adores Him as His Father: "I confess to Thee, O Father, Lord of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth" (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs25">Matthew 11:25</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs21">Luke 10:21</a>); "<a href="01006d.htm">Abba</a>, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> from me" (<a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs36">Mark 14:36</a>); "Father, sanctify me . . . Father glorify me . . . Just Father" (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm">John 17</a>). Already He seems to claim for Himself a worship of adoration equal to what he gives the Father: "If two of you shall consent upon earth, concerning anything whatsoever they shall ask, it shall be done to them by my Father who is in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. For where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs19">Matthew 18:19, 20</a>). The Apostles and even those who were not His disciples <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> to Him during His life-time: "Lord, if it be thou, bid me to come to thee upon the waters" (<a href="../bible/mat014.htm#vrs28">Matthew 14:28</a>); "Lord, save us, we perish" (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs25">Matthew 8:25</a>); "Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean" (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs2">Matthew 8:2</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs40">Mark 1:40</a>; <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs12">Luke 5:12</a>); "Have mercy on me, O Lord . . . But she came and adored him, saying: Lord, help me" (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#vrs22">Matthew 15:22</a>; 25), etc.</p>

<p>He <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> that <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be given in His name as well as in the name of the Father, "<a href="02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father, and of the <a href="14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs19">Matthew 28:19</a>). <a href="05709a.htm">Exorcisms</a>, <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, anointing of the sick are to be performed in His name: "In my name they shall cast out <a href="04764a.htm">devils</a> . . . they shall <a href="07698a.htm">lay their hands</a> upon the sick" (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17, 18</a>). In St. John this <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is emphasized: "That all men may <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> the Son, as they <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father" (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm">5:23</a>); "Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do; that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you will ask me anything in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto you have not asked anything in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> may be full . . . In that day you shall ask in my name" (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm">16:23-26</a>). No sooner is He <a href="01767a.htm">ascended to glory</a> than He is beside the Father and in consequence of His equality with Him the object of the worship of the early <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>; "All whatsoever you do" &#151; <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> has just been speaking of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> &#151; "in word or in work, do all in the name of the <a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, giving thanks to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father by him" (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#vrs17">Colossians 3:17</a>), which is like the ending of our own <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>. It seems probable that the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the choice of Matthias was addressed directly to Him: "Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men" (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs24">Acts 1:24</a>). His name becomes <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the formulas, "By the name of <a href="08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs10">Acts 4:10</a>), "By the name of thy holy Son <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>" (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs30">Acts 4:30</a>). <a href="14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a> to Him: "<a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, receive my spirit" (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs58">Acts 7:58</a>). The formulas of <a href="05709a.htm">exorcism</a> are also in His name: "I command thee (<a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a>) in the name of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to go out from her (the <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>)" (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs18">Acts 16:18</a>). Indeed even the Jewish <a href="05711a.htm">exorcists</a> attempted to make use of this name in their <a href="05709a.htm">exorcisms</a>: "Some of the Jewish <a href="05711a.htm">exorcists</a> . . . attempted to invoke over them that had <a href="04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, the name of the <a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, saying: I conjure you by <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, whom Paul preacheth" (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs13">Acts 19:13</a>). In <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> expressions like, "Grace to you and peace from <a href="06608a.htm">God our Father</a> and from the <a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>. I give thanks to my <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> . . . (Christ) Who is above all blessed forever," and others similar are too numerous for quotation. They likewise abound in the Apocalypse, usually in the form of a <a href="05150a.htm">doxology</a>, e.g. "To him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, benediction, <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, and glory, and power, for ever and ever . . . <a href="01407b.htm">Amen</a>" (<a href="../bible/rev005.htm#vrs13">Revelation 5:13-14</a>). The <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> and the writers of the first centuries likewise furnish us with an abundant harvest of similar formulas. (See Cabrol, <em>Monuments liturgica</em>, I, Paris, 1900-02, where the texts are collected in chronological order, especially nos. 612, 627, 649, 653, 656, etc., and also Cabrol. <em>Dict. d'arch&eacute;ologie chr&eacute;t. et de liturgie</em>, I, col. 614, 654.)</p>

<p>In virtue of the same principle and of the equality of the Divine Persons in the Trinity, the Holy Ghost also became the object of Christian worship. The formula of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> was given, as has been seen, <em>in the Name of the Father, and of the <a href="14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</em> In the <a href="05150a.htm">doxology</a> the Holy Spirit also has a place with the Father and the Son. In the Mass the Holy Ghost is invoked at the <a href="05502a.htm">Epiclesis</a> and invited to prepare the sacrifice. The <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, who in the second century preached, and awaited, the coming of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to take the place of the Son and announce a more perfect Gospel, made Him the object of an exclusive worship, which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had to repress. But it nevertheless vindicated the adoration of the Holy Ghost, and in 380 the <a href="01455e.htm">anathemas</a> pronounced by <a href="04613a.htm">Pope Damasus</a>, in the Fourth Council of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, condemned whosoever should deny that the Holy Ghost must be adored like the Father and the Son by every creature (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, <em>Enchiridion</em>, n. 80). These <a href="01455e.htm">anathemas</a> were renewed by <a href="03477c.htm">Celestine I</a> and Virgilius, and the <a href="04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> of 381 in its symbol, which took its place in the liturgy, formulated its <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Holy Ghost, "Who together with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified." These expressions indicate the unity of the adoration of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; that is, that one or the other Person of the Trinity may be adored separately but not to the exclusion of the other two.</p>

<h2>Beginnings of Christian worship</h2>

<p>It has been, and is still sometimes, asserted that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not establish worship or, rather, that He proscribed external worship and was unwilling to allow any but interior worship, the adoration of the heart "in spirit and in <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>." He wished, it is asserted, a religion without <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or altar, and admitted no temple save the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. The complicated whole which constitutes the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion is not, according to these writers, of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> origin and is to be condemned in the name of a purer <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. These objections were first formulated by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, who <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked the ceremonies of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially the Mass, as being tainted with <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>. They have been repeated by <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of modern times, which is not astonishing, for if <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> is <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> it will reach, as certain liberal <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have reached, the conclusion that worship should be purely individual and private. Each man should make his worship, like his religion and his creed, in accord with the principles of free inquiry (cf. Sabatier, <em>Esquisse d'une philosophie de la religion</em>, 1905, 5). The attacks of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, especially those of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Middleton, are cited in the articles on worship by the author of this article, quoted in the bibliography; we cannot here resume this discussion, but will merely summarize the origins of Christian worship.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Christ did not abolish at one stroke the ceremonies of Jewish worship. When it is said that He was satisfied with a wholly interior worship, thereby condemning exterior worship, the assertion is wholly gratuitous and is contradicted by facts. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a>, on the other hand, that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> went to the Temple to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a>, that he celebrated the <a href="11512b.htm">Pasch</a> and the Jewish feasts; he received <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> from John, subjected Himself to <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, laid His hands on the sick, drove out <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a> with <a href="05709a.htm">exorcisms</a>, and gave His disciples the power to drive them out in His name. It is almost certain that He carefully observed all the prescriptions of Jewish worship, for a deviation on one point or another would certainly have aroused protests of which some echo would have been preserved in the Gospels. The only point on which a protest of this kind was manifested was the observance of the <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and certain prescriptions which the <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> followed in too narrow a spirit. The Apostles and disciples at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> continued to go to the Temple, as we see in the Acts (<a href="../bible/act002.htm">2:46-47</a>; <a href="../bible/act003.htm">3:1</a>; <a href="../bible/act005.htm">5:21</a>; <a href="../bible/act005.htm">5:42</a>, etc.). By the worship in spirit and <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, which was to supplant the ancient worship, is meant less the form of a new worship than the spirit in which worship should be understood. Instead of adoring at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> or Garizim, men will adore everywhere; the believer will adore in his heart, no matter what his nation, be he <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>, <a href="13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, or even <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a>. And he will adore not like the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> or the <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, with a purely external worship, with the lips, and in a formalist and <a href="07610a.htm">hypocritical</a> manner, but with a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> and sincere worship, which supposed and implies a pure life and upright conduct.</p>

<p>But it must be recognized that if He did not directly attack the ancient worship, <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> substituted for it a new worship which would by degrees and naturally replace the Jewish worship. First came <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which might have been more or less clearly prefigured by the ablution of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but which assumed a new character in the Gospel and which is truly a new rite, for it is <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. It is especially the Eucharist, the Lord's Supper, which recalls the ancient <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. The Eucharist at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> was enshrined in the Jewish service of the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, profoundly modifying its character, and which also by concomitance, brought about the substitution of Sunday for the <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. This last fact, from the standpoint of Christian worship, is of the utmost importance, on which we cannot dwell here (see <a href="14335a.htm">SUNDAY</a>). The rites of penance, anointing of the sick, the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="15557b.htm">washing of the feet</a>, the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> on the <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>, some benedictions, invocations, <a href="05709a.htm">exorcisms</a>, follow close after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the Eucharist, and are mentioned in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. The <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and the various forms of psalmody are already in germ in the most ancient <a href="14382b.htm">Christian Synaxaria</a>. Soon came the cult of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> with the ceremonies for the burial of the dead. Sunday and soon Thursday and Friday constitute a <a href="15575b.htm">Christian week</a> wholly different from the Jewish week, the pivot of which had been the <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost became the pivot of a <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year. But this nucleus, which is almost all we know of the primitive <a href="09306a.htm">Christian liturgy</a>, dates from the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> generation. The residuum reached by successive eliminations, and by going back through the centuries, is <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> and exclusively <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, whatever analogies may be found with the Jewish ceremonies, because the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> rites, especially the Eucharist, <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the Sunday, have such a determinate significance as to permit of no mistake. This worship is <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> in the sense that the authors of its foremost and essential institutions were <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and the institutions are to be found in the Gospels, the Epistles, and the Acts. It has been shown above how this worship differs from the Jewish worship by a new character which is peculiar to it; its object is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.</p>

<h2>Jewish and pagan influences</h2>

<p>Although, as we have seen, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> constituted a worship for itself, it nevertheless retained several memorials of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a>, which was a preparation for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. But even here the originality and independence of the Christian worship are loudly affirmed. Thus the <a href="03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which was the great sacrament of <a href="08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and as it were its distinctive sign, was rejected by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a>, the religious capital of <a href="08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, was deserted by the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, even by those of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and it was never the centre of their worship. They <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> to assemble in private houses to hear the Word, to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a>, and to have the breaking of the bread. The Jewish feasts were likewise condemned. Neither the feast of Tabernacles, nor that of Lights, nor that of the Dedication, nor that of Purim left any trace in the <a href="03158a.htm">Christian calendar</a>.</p>

<p><a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost, which kept their Jewish names and even, to a certain extent, their place on the <a href="03158a.htm">Christian calendar</a>, changed their object, one becoming the feast of the <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and the other that of the Holy Ghost. But what is still more important, as has been said, is that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> substituted Sunday for the <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. The distinction between <a href="04010c.htm">clean and unclean</a> animals, which related to Jewish worship, was also rejected in the very beginning. On these questions, therefore, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> asserted its independence. However, it borrowed certain things from the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a>. It retained the Sacred Books as the most precious portion of its heritage and at once made them its <a href="09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>. For they are truly the core and the substance of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> also borrowed from the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the <a href="04775c.htm">Diaspora</a> the form of their meetings in the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a> on the <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. At first the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> meeting, like that of the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, was taken up with the singing of psalms and the reading of the Sacred Books, followed by an exhortation or <a href="07448a.htm">homily</a>. These are the chief points of Jewish influence on Christian worship.</p>

<p>The question of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> influences on <a href="09306a.htm">Christian liturgy</a> is more complicated, and requires lengthy considerations which can only be summarized here; for further details see works of Cabrol cited below in bibliography. According to some, it was through <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> that <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> influences slipped into Christian worship. <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, they assert, served somewhat as a bridge between <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. This theory, which has been chiefly supported by Renan in his <em>Origines du christianisme</em>, has now lost much ground. The <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> is rather the contrary. <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, which borrowed from all sides, borrowed from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> several of its <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> practices. This theory is sustained by Matter in his great work on <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>; it is also defended by Probst (<em>Sakramente u. Sakramentalien</em>, T&uuml;bingen, 1872, 11, 12, sqq.) and Duchesne (Christian Worship, 336). According to others, it was much later, in the fourth century, that the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> allowed itself to be contaminated by <a href="12223b.htm">polytheism</a> and admitted numerous <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> practices (Harnack, <em>Das Wesen des Christentums</em>, <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1900, 126, 137-38, 148). But most frequently these pretended borrowings are only unmeaning analogies, and when the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> borrowed from the religion of the <a href="06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> certain general rites which are current in all <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a>, such as the use of <a href="07716a.htm">incense</a>, lights, processions, gold and silver ornaments, she did not fail to profoundly change their character. This has been shown by <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> with his usual profundity in several chapters of his <em>Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine</em> (ed. 1894, 169 sqq.). This is admitted even by such writers as Loisy (L'&eacute;vangile et l'&eacute;glise, 186) and Reville (La religion &agrave; <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> sous les S&eacute;v&eacute;res, 294).</p>

<p>Most of these pretended borrowings have no bearing on the essence of the liturgy. From the very first, Christian worship was in possession of all its organs. Instances have been cited of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> feasts becoming <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> temple <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the worship of the <a href="06608a.htm">true God</a>, of fountains, of <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of the gods <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> and transformed into <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> patrons. It does not suffice to say, as has been said, that <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has been superimposed on <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>, that it is a religion of superimposition. With regard to the cult of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> which has been especially assailed ["A low type of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was born of the cult of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>" &#151; (Harnack, op. cit., 126); in the same sense, Lucius, <em>Die Anf&auml;nge des heiligenkultus in der Christlichen Kirche</em>, T&uuml;bingen, 1904, and Saintyves, <em>Les saints successuers des dieux</em>, Paris, 1907] a serious and profound study of the subject has led such scholars as Delehaye, Dufourcq, and Vacandard to conclude that the worship of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> was not borrowed from <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>, and also that it indicates a high type of religion. The <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> gods and heroes never died. Local <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> were not, no matter what has been said to the contrary, the local gods dressed up to suit <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> are the enemies of the gods as much as their successors. And it is an illusion to believe that by a mysterious transformation the gods and the Graeco-Roman heroes have survived in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. There is no <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that a single one of them has even been <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> under the name of a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> or even under a travesty of his own name (Vacandard, <em>Etude de critque et d'histoire religieuse</em>, 3d series: <em>Les origines du culte des <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a></em>, 211, 212). Moreover it is easy to prove that, given the opposition of principle between <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>, the two <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> could scarcely borrow from each other. <a href="11388a.htm">Paganism</a> was based on the worship of many gods, and, at least for the masses, this worship usually consisted of gross <a href="06052b.htm">fetishism</a>. When <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> existed among the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> it was generally narrow, <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and paltry. The gods were <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> either to win their favour, or to avert their <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a>, while the god of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> desired to be worshipped in spirit and in <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. The worship of the <a href="06608a.htm">one true God</a> is at the bottom of all <a href="09306a.htm">Christian liturgy</a>.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be said that, while admitting that certain customs or rites accepted by <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> may have existed in <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>, though with a very different significance, we must guard against admitting all the resemblances which have been suggested in recent years between <a href="09306a.htm">Christian liturgy</a> and <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a>. In these cases all the evidence of assimilation must be established according to historical methods. Certain analogies between the two rites are merely fortuitous coincidences, and not borrowings. The misconceptions of some scholars of recent years are no longer of any value. There has been an attempt to see in the inscription of Abercius the epitaph of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Cybele and to prove that <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> borrowed the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> from the Corinthian mysteries of Eleusis, while certain <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> have been made to resemble <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> divinities. Even if some of these comparisons can be sustained, most of them are founded only on <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Space does not permit an enumeration of examples; these will be found in the monographs and articles cited in the bibliography.</p>
