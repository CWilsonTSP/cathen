<h1>St. Engelbert of Cologne</h1>

<p><a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of that city (1216-1225); b. at Berg, about 1185; d. near Schwelm, 7 November, 1225. His father was Engelbert, Count of Berg, his mother, Margaret, daughter of the Count of Gelderland. He studied at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of Cologne and while still a boy was, according to an abuse of that time, made <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a> of the churches of St. George and St. Severin at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and of St. Mary's at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. In 1199 he was elected <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Cologne. He led a worldly life and in the conflict between <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Adolf and Bruno sided with his cousin Adolf, and waged <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> for him. He was in consequence <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> together with his cousin and deposed in 1206. After his submission he was reinstated in 1208 and, to atone for his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, joined the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> in 1212. On 29 Feb., 1216, the chapter of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> elected him <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by a unanimous vote. In appearance he was tall and handsome. He possessed a penetrating mind and keen discernment, was kind and condescending and <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and peace, but he was also ambitious and self willed. His <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> had passed through severe struggles and suffered heavily, and he worked strenuously to repair the damage and to restore order. He took care of its possessions and revenues and was on that account compelled to resort to arms. He defeated the Duke of <a href="09260a.htm">Limburg</a> and the Count of Cleves and defended against them also the countship of Berg, which he had inherited in 1218 on the death of his brother. He restrained the impetuous citizens of Cologne, broke the stubbornness of the nobility, and erected strongholds for the defence of his territories. He did not spare even his own relations when guilty. In this way he gained the universal veneration of his people and increased the number of his vassals from year to year. Although in exterior bearing a sovereign rather than a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for which he was blamed by <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, he did not disregard his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, but strove to uplift the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> of his people. The <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> which had been founded shortly before his accession, settled in cologne during his administration, the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in 1219, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in 1221. He was well disposed towards the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and insisted on strict religious observance in them. Ecclesiastical affairs were regulated in <a href="12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>. Blameless in his own life, he was a friend of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and a helper of the poor.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the affairs of the empire Engelbert exerted a strong influence. <a href="06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, who had taken up his residence permanently in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, gave <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> to his son, Henry VII, then still a minor, and in 1221 appointed Engelbert guardian of the king and administrator of the empire. When the young king reached the age of twelve he was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, 8 May, 122, by Engelbert, who <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> him as his own son and <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> him as his sovereign. He watched over the king's <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and governed the empire in his name, careful above all to secure peace both within and without the realm. At the Diet of Nordhausen (24 Sept., 1223) he made an important treaty with <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>; in the rupture between <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> he sided with <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and broke off relations with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The poet Walther von der Vogelweide extols him as "Master of sovereigns", and "True guardian of the king, thy exalted traits do <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> to our emperor; chancellor whose like has never been".</p>

<p>Engelbert's devotion to <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, and his obedience to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and to the emperor were eventually the cause of his ruin. Many of the nobility feared rather than <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> him, and he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to surround himself with a body-guard. The greatest danger threatened him from among his relations. His cousin, count Frederick of Isenberg, the secular administrator for the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Essen, had grievously oppressed that <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>. <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> and the emperor urged Engelbert to protect the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> in their <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. Frederick wished to forestall the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and his wife incited him to <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a>. Even his two brothers, the Bishops of M&uuml;nster and Osnabr&uuml;ck, were suspected as privy to the matter. Engelbert was warned, commended himself to the protection of <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, and amid tears made a confession of his whole life to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10323a.htm">Minden</a>. On 7 Nov., 1225, as he was journeying from Soest to Schwelm to <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a church, he was attacked on a dark evening by Frederick and his associates in a narrow defile, was wounded in the thigh, torn from his horse and killed. His body was covered with forty-seven wounds. It was placed on a dung-cart and brought to cologne on the fourth day. King Henry wept bitterly over the remains, put the murderer under the ban of the empire, and saw him broken on the wheel a year later at Cologne. He died contrite, having acknowledged and confessed his guilt. His associates also perished miserably within a short time. The crime, moreover, was disastrous for the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, for the young king had now lost his best adviser and soon met a very sad fate, to the misfortune of his house and country.</p>

<p>Engelbert, by his <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> made amends for his human weaknesses. His body was placed in the old <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cologne, 24 Feb., 1226, by <a href="04261a.htm">Cardinal Conrad von Urach</a>. The latter also declared him a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>; a formal <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> did not take place. In 1618 Archbishop Ferdinand ordered that his feast be celebrated on 7 November and solemnly raised his remains in 1622. In the <a href="09741a.htm">martyrology</a> Engelbert is commemorated on 7 Nov., as a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>. A <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> was erected at the place of his death. By order of Engelbert's successor, Henry I, <a href="03137a.htm">C&aelig;sarius of Heisterbach</a>, who possessed good information and a ready pen, wrote in 1226 the life of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> in two books and added a third about his <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> (See <a href="14343c.htm">Surius</a>, "Vit&aelig; Sanctorum", 7 Nov.)</p>
