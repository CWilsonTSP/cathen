<p>Gabriello Condulmaro, or Condulmerio, b. at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1383; elected 4 March, 1431; d. at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 23 Feb., 1447. He sprang from a wealthy Venetia <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and was a nephew, on the mother's side, of <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>. His personal presence was princely and imposing. He was tall, thin, with a remarkably winning countenance. Coming at an early age into the possession of great wealth, he distributed 20,000 ducats to the poor and, turning his back upon the world, entered the Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. George in his native city. At the age of twenty-four he was appointed by his uncle <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>; but since the people of that city objected to the rule of a foreigner, he resigned the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and, in 1408, was created <a href="03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of St. Clement. He rendered signal service to <a href="09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a> by his labours as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> in Picenum (March of <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>) and later by quelling a sedition of the Bolognesi. In recognition of his abilities, the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>, assembled at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the church of the Minerva after the death of <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, elected Cardinal Condulmaro to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> on the first scrutiny. He assumed the name of Eugene IV, possibly anticipating a stormy pontificate similar to that of <a href="05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>. Stormy, in fact, his reign was destined to be; and it cannot be denied that many of his troubles were owing to his own want of tact, which alienated all parties from him. By the terms of the capitulation which he signed before election and afterwards confirmed by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, Eugene secured to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> one-half of all the revenues of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and promised to consult with them on all questions of importance relating to the spiritual and temporal concerns of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. He was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> at St. Peter's, 11 March, 1431.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Eugene continued on the throne his simple routine of monastic life and gave great edification by his regularity and unfeigned <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. But his <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of nepotism, the solitary defect of his great predecessor, led him into a fierce and sanguinary conflict with the house of Colonna, which would have resulted disastrously for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, had not Florence, <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> come to his aid. A peace was patched up by virtue of which the Colonnesi surrendered their castles and paid an indemnity of 75,000 ducats. Scarcely was this danger averted when Eugene became involved in a far more serious struggle, destined to trouble his entire pontificate. <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> had convoked the <a href="02334b.htm">Council of Basle</a> which opened with scant attendance 23 July, 1431. Distrusting the spirit which was reigning at the council, Eugene, by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 18 Dec., 1431, dissolved it, to meet eighteen months later in Bologna. There is no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this exercise of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogative would sooner or later have become imperative; but it seems unwise to have resorted to it before the council had taken any overt steps in the wrong direction. It alienated public opinion, and gave colour to the charge that the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> was opposed to any measures of reform. The <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> at Basle refused to separate, and issued an <a href="05413a.htm">encyclical</a> to all the faithful in which they proclaimed their determination to continue their labours. In this course they had the assurance of support from all the <a href="02137c.htm">secular powers</a>, and on 15 Feb., 1432, they reasserted the Gallican <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the superiority of the council to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (see <a href="04288a.htm">C<font size=-2>OUNCIL OF</font> C<font size=-2>ONSTANCE</font></a>). All efforts to induce Eugene to recall his <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of dissolution having failed, the council, on 29 April, formally summoned the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and his <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to appear at Basle within three months, or to be punished for <a href="04340a.htm">contumacy</a>. The <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> which now seemed inevitable was for the time averted by the exertions of Sigismund, who had come to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to receive the imperial crown, 31 May, 1433. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> recalled the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> and acknowledged the council as &aelig;cumenical, 15 Dec., 1433. In the following May, 1434, a revolution, fomented by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> enemies, broke out in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Eugene, in the garb of a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, and pelted with stones, escaped down the Tiber to <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, whence the friendly Florentines conducted him to their city and received him with an ovation. He took up his residence in the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Novella, and sent Vitelleschi, the militant <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12675a.htm">Recanati</a>, to restore order in the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>.</p>

<p>The prolonged sojourn of the Roman Court in <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, then the centre of the literary activity of its age, gave a strong impetus to the Humanistic movement. During his stay in the <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> capital, Eugene <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the beautiful <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, just then finished by <a href="03008c.htm">Brunelleschi</a>. Meanwhile, the rupture between the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the revolutionists at Basle, now completely controlled by the radical party under the leadership of Cardinal d'Allemand, of Arles, became complete. This time our sympathies are entirely on the side of the pontiff, for the proceedings of the little coterie which assumed the name of authority of a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> were utterly subversive of the Divine constitution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. By abolishing all sources of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> revenue and restricting in every way the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogative, they sought to reduce the head of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to a mere shadow. Eugene answered with a dignified appeal to the <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> powers. The struggle came to a crisis in the matter of the negotiations for union with the Greeks. The majority at Basle were in favour of holding a council in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> or <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. But geography was against them. <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was much more convenient for the Greeks; and they declared for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. This so provoked the radical party at Basle that on 3 July, 1437, they issued a <em>monitum</em> against Eugene, heaping all sorts of accusations upon him. In reply the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> published (18 Sept.) a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> in which he transferred the council to <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Though the council declared the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> invalid, and threatened the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> with deposition, yet the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> dealt a deadly blow to the adversaries of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy. The better disposed leaders, notably Cardinals Cesarini and Cusa, left them and repaired to <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, where the council convened by Eugene opened, 8 Jan., 1438, under the presidency of <a href="01258b.htm">Cardinal Albergati</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The deliberations with the Greeks lasted for over a year, and were concluded at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 5 July, 1439, by the Decree of Union. Though the union was not permanent, it vastly enhanced the prestige of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The union with the Greeks was followed by that of the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, 22 Nov., 1439, the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, 1443, and the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, 1445. Eugene exerted himself to the utmost in rousing the nations of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> to resist the advances of the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. A powerful array was formed in <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and a fleet was despatched to the Hellespont. The first successes of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were followed, in 1444, by the crushing defeat at Varna. In the mean time, the dwindling conventicle at Basle proceeded on the path of <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. On 24 Jan., 1438, Eugene was pronounced suspended, and this step was followed by his deposition on 25 June, 1439, on the charge of <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> conduct towards a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>. To crown their <a href="08001a.htm">infamy</a>, the sectaries, now reduced to one <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and eleven <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, elected an <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="06031b.htm">Duke Amadeus of Savoy</a>, as <a href="06031b.htm">Felix V</a>. But <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, having recently experienced the horrors of a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, repudiated the revolutionary step, and, before his death, Eugene had the <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of seeing the entire <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>, at least in theory, obedient to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The decrees of Florence have since been the solid basis of the spiritual authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>.</p>

<p>Eugene secured his position in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> by a treaty, 6 July, 1443, with Alfonso of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, whom he confirmed as monarch of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and after an exile of nearly ten years he made a triumphant entry into <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on 28 Sept., 1443. He devoted his remaining years to the amelioration of the sad condition of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and to the consolidation of his spiritual authority among the nations of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He was unsuccessful in his efforts to induce the French court to cancel the anti-papal <a href="12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a> (7 July, 1438), but, by prudent compromises and the skill of &#198;neas Silvius, he gained a marked success in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. On the eve of his death he signed (5, 7 Feb., 1447) with the German nation the so-called Frankfort, or Princes', Concordat, a series of four <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, in which, after long hesitancy and against the advice of many <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, he recognized, not without diplomatic reserve, the persistent German contentions for a new council in a German city, the mandatory <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="04288a.htm">Constance</a> (Frequens) on the frequency of such councils, also its authority (and that of other <a href="04423f.htm">general councils</a>), but after the manner of his predecessors, from whom he declared that he did not intend to differ. On the same day he issued another document, the so-called "Bulla Salvatoria", in which he asserted that notwithstanding these concessions, made in his last illness when unable to examine them with more care, he did not intend to do aught contrary to the teachings of the Fathers, or the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and authority of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> (Hergenr&ouml;ther-Kirsch, II, 941-2). See <a href="12126c.htm">P<font size=-2>IUS </font> II</a>; <a href="07010a.htm">G<font size=-2>REGORY OF</font> H<font size=-2>EIMBURG</font></a>.</p>
