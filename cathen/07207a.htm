<h2 id="section1">Name and place of hell</h2>

<p>The term <em>hell</em> is cognate to "hole" (cavern) and "hollow". It is a substantive formed from the Anglo-Saxon <em>helan</em> or <em>behelian</em>, "to hide". This verb has the same primitive as the Latin <em>occulere</em> and <em>celare</em> and the Greek <em>kalyptein</em>. Thus by derivation hell denotes a dark and hidden place. In ancient Norse mythology Hel is the ill-favoured goddess of the underworld. Only those who fall in battle can enter Valhalla; the rest go down to Hel in the underworld, not all, however, to the place of punishment of criminals.</p>

<p>Hell (<em>infernus</em>) in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> usage is a place of punishment after death. <a href="14580a.htm">Theologians</a> distinguish four meanings of the term <em>hell</em>:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>hell in the strict sense, or the place of punishment for the damned, be they <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a> or <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>;</li><li>the <a href="09256a.htm">limbo</a> of infants (<em>limbus parvulorum</em>), where those who die in <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone, and without personal mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, are confined and undergo some kind of punishment;</li><li>the <a href="09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers (<em>limbus patrum</em>), in which the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just who died before <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> awaited their admission to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>; for in the meantime <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> was closed against them in punishment for the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam;</li><li><a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, where the just, who die in venial <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> or who still owe a <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> of temporal punishment for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, are cleansed by suffering before their admission to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The present article treats only of hell in the strict sense of the term.</p>

<p>The Latin <em>infernus</em> (<em>inferum, inferi</em>), the Greek <em>Hades</em>, and the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>sheol</em> correspond to the word <em>hell</em>. Infernus is derived from the root <em>in</em>; hence it designates hell as a place within and below the earth. <em>Haides</em>, formed from the root <em>fid</em>, to see, and <em>a</em> privative, denotes an invisible, hidden, and dark place; thus it is similar to the term <em>hell</em>. The derivation of <em>sheol</em> is <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. It is generally supposed to come from the Hebrew root meaning, "to be sunk in, to be hollow"; accordingly it denotes a cave or a place under the earth. In the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (<a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <em>hades</em>; <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> <em>infernus</em>) sheol is used quite in general to designate the kingdom of the dead, of the good (<a href="../bible/gen037.htm#vrs35">Genesis 37:35</a>) as well as of the bad (<a href="../bible/num016.htm#vrs30">Numbers 16:30</a>); it means hell in the strict sense of the term, as well as the <a href="09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers. But, as the <a href="09256a.htm">limbo</a> of the Fathers ended at the time of <a href="01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a>, <em>hades</em> (<a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> <em>infernus</em>) in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> always designates the hell of the damned. Since <a href="01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> the just no longer go down to the lower world, but they dwell in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs1">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>). However, in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the term <em>Gehenna</em> is used more frequently in preference to <em>hades</em>, as a name for the place of punishment of the damned. Gehenna is the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>g&ecirc;-hinnom</em> (<a href="../bible/neh011.htm#vrs30">Nehemiah 11:30</a>), or the longer form <em>g&ecirc;-ben-hinnom</em> (<a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs8">Joshua 15:8</a>), and <em>g&ecirc;-ben&ecirc;-hinnom</em> (<a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#vrs10">2 Kings 23:10</a>) "valley of the sons of Hinnom". Hinnom seems to be the name of a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> not otherwise known. The Valley of Hinnom is south of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and is now called Wadi er-rababi. It was <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a> as the scene, in earlier days, of the horrible worship of <a href="10443b.htm">Moloch</a>. For this reason it was defiled by Josias (<a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#vrs10">2 Kings 23:10</a>), cursed by Jeremias (<a href="../bible/jer007.htm#vrs31">Jeremiah 7:31-33</a>), and held in abomination by the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who, accordingly, used the name of this valley to designate the abode of the damned (Targ. Jon., Gen., iii, 24; Henoch, c. xxvi). And <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> adopted this usage of the term. Besides Hades and Gehenna, we find in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> many other names for the abode of the damned. It is called "lower hell" (<a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> <em>tartarus</em>) (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#vrs4">2 Peter 2:4</a>), "abyss" (<a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs31">Luke 8:31</a> and elsewhere), "place of torments" (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs28">Luke 16:28</a>), "pool of fire" (<a href="../bible/rev019.htm#vrs20">Revelation 19:20</a> and elsewhere), "furnace of fire" (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs42">Matthew 13:42, 50</a>), "unquenchable fire" (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs12">Matthew 3:12</a>, and elsewhere), "everlasting fire" (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs8">Matthew 18:8</a>; <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs41">25:41</a>; <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#vrs7">Jude 7</a>), "exterior darkness" (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs12">Matthew 7:12</a>; <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs13">22:13</a>; <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs30">25:30</a>), "mist" or "storm of darkness" (<a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#vrs17">2 Peter 2:17</a>; <a href="../bible/jud001.htm#vrs13">Jude 13</a>). The state of the damned is called "destruction" (<em>apoleia</em>, <a href="../bible/phi003.htm">Philippians 3:19</a> and elsewhere), "perdition" (<em>olethros</em>, <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs9">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "eternal destruction" (<em>olethros aionios</em>, <a href="../bible/2th001.htm#vrs9">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>), "corruption" (<em>phthora</em>, <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#vrs8">Galatians 6:8</a>), "death" (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs21">Romans 6:21</a>), "second death" (<a href="../bible/rev002.htm#vrs11">Revelation 2:11</a> and elsewhere).</p>



<p>Where is hell? Some were of opinion that hell is everywhere, that the damned are at liberty to roam about in the entire <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>, but that they carry their punishment with them. The adherents of this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> were called Ubiquists, or Ubiquitarians; among them were, e.g., Johann Brenz, a Swabian, a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the sixteenth century. However, that opinion is universally and deservedly rejected; for it is more in keeping with their state of punishment that the damned be limited in their movements and confined to a definite place. Moreover, if hell is a real fire, it cannot be everywhere, especially after the consummation of the world, when <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth shall have been made anew. As to its locality all kinds of conjectures have been made; it has been suggested that hell is situated on some far island of the sea, or at the two poles of the earth; Swinden, an Englishman of the eighteenth century, fancied it was in the sun; some assigned it to the moon, others to Mars; others placed it beyond the confines of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> [<a href="15618d.htm">Wiest</a>, "Instit. theol.", VI (1789), 869]. The Bible seems to indicate that hell is within the earth, for it describes hell as an abyss to which the wicked descend. We even read of the earth opening and of the wicked sinking down into hell (<a href="../bible/num016.htm#vrs31">Numbers 16:31 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/psa054.htm#vrs16">Psalm 54:16</a>; <a href="../bible/isa005.htm#vrs14">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="../bible/eze026.htm#vrs20">Ezekiel 26:20</a>; <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs10">Philippians 2:10</a>, etc.). Is this merely a metaphor to illustrate the state of separation from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>? Although <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is omnipresent, He is said to dwell in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, because the light and grandeur of the stars and the <a href="06079b.htm">firmament</a> are the brightest manifestations of His <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> splendour. But the damned are utterly estranged from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; hence their abode is said to be as remote as possible from his dwelling, far from <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> above and its light, and consequently hidden away in the dark abysses of the earth. However, no cogent reason has been advanced for accepting a metaphorical interpretation in preference to the most natural meaning of the words of Scripture. Hence <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> generally accept the opinion that hell is really within the earth. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has decided nothing on this subject; hence we may say hell is a definite place; but where it is, we do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>. <a href="08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> reminds us: "We must not ask where hell is, but how we are to escape it" (In Rom., hom. xxxi, n. 5, in P.G., LX, 674). <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> says: "It is my opinion that the nature of hell-fire and the location of hell are known to no man unless the Holy Ghost made it known to him by a special revelation", (<a href="../fathers/120120.htm"><em>City of God</em> XX.16</a>). Elsewhere he expresses the opinion that hell is under the earth (Retract., II, xxiv, n. 2 in P.L., XXXII, 640). <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> wrote: "I do not dare to decide this question. Some thought hell is somewhere on earth; others believe it is under the earth" (Dial., IV, xlii, in P.L., LXXVII, 400; cf. Patuzzi, "De sede inferni", 1763; Gretser, "De subterraneis animarum receptaculis", 1595).</p>

<h2 id="section2">Existence of hell</h2>

<p>There is a hell, i.e. all those who die in personal mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, as enemies of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and unworthy of eternal life, will be severely punished by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> after death. On the nature of mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, see <a href="14004b.htm">SIN</a>; on the immediate beginning of punishment after death, see <a href="08550a.htm">PARTICULAR JUDGMENT</a>. As to the fate of those who die free from personal mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, but in <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>, see <a href="09256a.htm">LIMBO</a> (<em>limbus parvulorum</em>).</p>

<p>The existence of hell is, of course, denied by all those who deny the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a> or the <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. Thus among the <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> the <a href="13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, among the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, the <a href="13688c.htm">Seleucians</a>, and in our own time <a href="10041b.htm">Materialists</a>, <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheists</a>, etc., deny the existence of hell. But apart from these, if we abstract from the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the pains of hell, the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> has never met any opposition worthy of mention.</p>

<p>The existence of hell is <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> first of all from the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>.

A very complete development of the Scriptural argument, especially in regard to the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, may be found in Atzberger's "Die christliche Eschatologie in den Stadien ihrer Offenbarung im Alten und Neuen Testament", Freiburg, 1890. Also the Fathers, from the very earliest times, are unanimous in teaching that the wicked will be punished after death. And in <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of their <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> they appeal both to Scripture and to reason (cf. Ignatius, "Ad Eph.", v, 16; "Martyrium s. Polycarpi", ii, n, 3; xi, n.2; <a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a>, "Apol.", II, n. 8 in P.G., VI, 458; <a href="02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, "De resurr. mort.", c. xix, in P.G., VI, 1011; <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103527.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> V.27.2</a>; <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Adv. Marc.", I, c. xxvi, in P.L., IV, 277). For citations from this patristic teaching see Atzberger, "Gesh. der christl. Eschatologie innerhalb der vornicanischen Zeit" (Freiburg, 1896); <a href="11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, "De Angelis", III, iv sqq.</p>

<p>The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> professes her <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a>: "They that have done good shall go into life everlasting, and they that have done <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> into everlasting fire" (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", 10th ed., 1908, n.40). The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has repeatedly defined this <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, e.g. in the profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> made in the <a href="09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a> (Denz., n. 464) and in the Decree of Union in the <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (Denz., N. 693): "the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who depart in mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, or only in <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>, go down immediately into hell, to be visited, however, with unequal punishments" (<em>poenis disparibus</em>).</p>

<p>If we abstract from the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of its punishment, the existence of hell can be demonstrated even by the light of mere reason. In His <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> as well as in His wisdom, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> must avenge the violation of the moral order in such wise as to preserve, at least in general, some proportion between the gravity of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and the severity of punishment. But it is evident from experience that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> does not always do this on earth; therefore He will inflict punishment after death. Moreover, if all men were fully convinced that the sinner need fear no kind of punishment after death, moral and social order would be seriously menaced. This, however, Divine wisdom cannot permit. Again, if there were no retribution beyond that which takes place before our eyes here on earth, we should have to consider <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> extremely indifferent to <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, and we could in no way account for His <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Nor can it be said: the wicked will be punished, but not by any positive infliction: for either death will be the end of their existence, or, forfeiting the rich reward of the good, they will enjoy some lesser degree of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. These are arbitrary and vain subterfuges, unsupported by any sound reason; positive punishment is the natural recompense of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>. Besides, due proportion between demerit and punishment would be rendered impossible by an indiscriminate annihilation of all the wicked. And finally, if men <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> that their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> would not be followed by sufferings, the mere threat of annihilation at the moment of death, and still less the prospect of a somewhat lower degree of beatitude, would not suffice to deter them from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, reason easily understands that in the next life the just will be made <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> as a reward of their virtue (<em>see</em> <a href="07170a.htm">HEAVEN</a>). But the punishment of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> is the natural counterpart of the reward of <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Hence, there will also be punishment for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> in the next life. Accordingly, we find among all nations the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> that evil-doers will be punished after death. This universal conviction of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> is an additional <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> for the existence of hell. For it is impossible that, in regard to the fundamental questions of their being and their destiny, all men should fall into the same <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>; else the power of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> would be essentially deficient, and the order of this world would be unduly wrapt in mystery; this however, is repugnant both to nature and to the wisdom of the Creator. On the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> of all nations in the existence of hell cf. L&uuml;ken, "Die Traditionen des Menschengeschlechts" (2nd ed., M&uuml;nster, 1869); Knabenbauer, "Das Zeugnis des Menschengeschlechts fur die Unsterblichkeit der Seele" (1878). The few men who, despite the morally universal conviction of the <a href="09580c.htm">human race</a>, deny the existence of hell, are mostly <a href="02040a.htm">atheists</a> and <a href="05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>. But if the view of such men in the fundamental question of our being could be the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> one, <a href="01624b.htm">apostasy</a> would be the way to light, <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and wisdom.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Eternity of hell</h2>

<p>Many admit the existence of hell, but deny the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of its punishment. Conditionalists hold only a hypothetical <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, and assert that after undergoing a certain amount of punishment, the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the wicked will be annihilated. Among the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> the Valentinians held this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and later on also Arnobius, the <a href="14113a.htm">Socinians</a>, many <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> both in the past and in our own times, especially of late (Edw. White, "Life in Christ", New York, 1877). The Universalists teach that in the end all the damned, at least all human <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, will attain beatitude (<em>apokatastasis ton panton</em>, <em>restitutio omnium</em>, according to <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>). This was a tenet of the <a href="11306b.htm">Origenists</a> and the Misericordes of whom <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> speaks (<a href="../fathers/120121.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXI.18</a>). There were individual adherents of this opinion in every century, e.g. <a href="05519a.htm">Scotus Eriugena</a>; in particular, many <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of the last centuries defended this <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>, e.g. in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, Farrar, "Eternal Hope" (five sermons preached in <a href="15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>, <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> and New York, 1878). Among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Hirscher and Schell have recently expressed the opinion that those who do not die in the state of grace can still be converted after death if they are not too wicked and impenitent.</p>

<p>The <a href="../bible.html">Holy Bible</a> is quite explicit in teaching the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the pains of hell. The torments of the damned shall last forever and ever (<a href="../bible/rev014.htm#vrs11">Revelation 14:11</a>; <a href="../bible/rev019.htm#vrs3">19:3</a>; <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#vrs10">20:10</a>). They are everlasting just as are the joys of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs46">Matthew 25:46</a>). Of <a href="08539a.htm">Judas</a> <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> says: "it were better for him, if that man had not been born" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs24">Matthew 26:24</a>). But this would not have been <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> if <a href="08539a.htm">Judas</a> was ever to be released from hell and admitted to <a href="07170a.htm">eternal happiness</a>. Again, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> says of the damned: "Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched" (<a href="../bible/isa066.htm#vrs24">Isaiah 66:24</a>; <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs43">Mark 9:43, 45, 47</a>). The fire of hell is repeatedly called eternal and unquenchable. The wrath of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> abideth on the damned (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs36">John 3:36</a>); they are vessels of Divine wrath (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#vrs22">Romans 9:22</a>); they shall not possess the <a href="08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs10">1 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs21">Galatians 5:21</a>), etc. The objections adduced from Scripture against this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> are so meaningless that they are not worth while discussing in detail. The teaching of the fathers is not less clear and decisive (cf. Patavius, "De Angelis", III, viii). We merely call to mind the testimony of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who often declared that they were glad to suffer pain of brief duration in order to escape eternal torments; e.g. "Martyrium Polycarpi", c. ii (cf. Atzberger, "Geschichte", II, 612 sqq.). It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> fell into <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> on this point; but precisely for this <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> he was condemned by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (Canones adv. Origenem ex Justiniani libro adv. <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>., can. ix; <a href="07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, III, 279 E; Denz., n. 211). In vain attempts were made to undermine the authority of these canons (cf. Dickamp, "Die origenistischen Streitigkeiten", M&uuml;nster, 1899, 137). Besides even in <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> we find the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> teaching on the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the pains of hell; for in his words the faithful <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> was again and again victorious over the doubting <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. <a href="07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> seems to have favoured the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>; many, however, believe that his statements can be shown to be in harmony with <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. But the suspicions that have been cast on some passages of <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> and <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a> are decidedly without justification (cf. Pesch, "Theologische Zeitfragen", 2nd series, 190 sqq.). The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> professes her <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the pains of hell in clear terms in the <a href="02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a> (Denz., nn. 40), in authentic <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions (Denz, nn. 211, 410, 429, 807, 835, 915), and in countless passages of her liturgy; she never <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a> for the damned. Hence, beyond the possibility of <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> expressly teaches the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the pains of hell as a <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> which no one can deny or call in question without manifest <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But what is the attitude of mere reason towards this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>? Just as <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> must appoint some fixed term for the time of trial, after which the just will enter into the secure possession of a <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> that can never again be lost in all <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>, so it is likewise appropriate that after the expiration of that term the wicked will be cut off from all hope of conversion and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For the malice of men cannot compel <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to prolong the appointed time of probation and to grant them again and again, without end, the power of deciding their lot for <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Any <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to act in this manner would be unworthy of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, because it would make Him dependent on the caprice of human malice, would rob His threats in great part of their efficacy, and would offer the amplest scope and the strongest incentive to human presumption. <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has actually appointed the end of this present life, or the moment of death, as the term of man's probation. For in that moment there takes place in our life an essential and momentous change; from the state of union with the body the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> passes into a life apart. No other sharply defined instant of our life is of like importance. Hence we must conclude that death is the end of our probation; for it is meet that our trial should terminate at a moment of our existence so prominent and significant as to be easily perceived by every man. Accordingly, it is the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> of all people that eternal retribution is dealt out immediately after death. This conviction of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> is an additional <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of our thesis.</p>

<p>Finally, the preservation of moral and social order would not be sufficiently provided for, if <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> knew that the time of trial were to be continued after death.</p>

<p>Many believe that reason cannot give any conclusive <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> for the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the pains of hell, but that it can merely show that this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> does not involve any contradiction. Since the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has made no decision on this point, each one is entirely free to embrace this opinion. As is apparent, the author of this article does not hold it. We admit that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> might have extended the time of trial beyond death; however, had He done so, He would have permitted man to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> about it, and would have made corresponding provision for the maintenance of moral order in this life. We may further admit that it is not intrinsically impossible for <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to annihilate the sinner after some definite amount of punishment; but this would be less in conformity with the nature of man's <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>; and, secondly, we know of no fact that might give us any right to suppose <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> will act in such a manner.</p>

<p>The objection is made that there is no proportion between the brief moment of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and an eternal punishment. But why not? We certainly admit a proportion between a momentary good deed and its eternal reward, not, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, a proportion of duration, but a proportion between the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and its appropriate sanction. Again, <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is an offence against the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> authority of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and the sinner is in some way aware of this, though but imperfectly. Accordingly there is in <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> an approximation to <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> malice which deserves an eternal punishment. Finally, it must be remembered that, although the act of <a href="14004b.htm">sinning</a> is brief, the guilt of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> remains forever; for in the next life the sinner never turns away from his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> by a sincere conversion. It is further objected that the sole object of punishment must be to reform the evil-doer. This is not <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>. Besides punishments inflicted for correction, there are also punishments for the satisfaction of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. But <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> demands that whoever departs from the right way in his search for <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> shall not find his <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but lose it. The <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the pains of hell responds to this demand for <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. And, besides, the fear of hell does really deter many from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>; and thus, in as far as it is threatened by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, eternal punishment also serves for the reform of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>. But if <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> threatens man with the pains of hell, He must also carry out His threat if man does not heed it by avoiding <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>For solving other objections it should be noted:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not only <a href="08004a.htm">infinitely</a> good, He is <a href="08004a.htm">infinitely</a> wise, just, and holy.</li><li>No one is cast into hell unless he has fully and entirely deserved it.</li><li>The sinner perseveres forever in his <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition.</li><li>We must not consider the eternal punishment of hell as a series of separate of distinct terms of punishment, as if <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> were forever again and again pronouncing a new sentence and inflicting new penalties, and as if He could never satisfy His desire of vengeance. Hell is, especially in the eyes of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, one and indivisible in its entirety; it is but one sentence and one penalty. We may represent to ourselves a punishment of indescribable intensity as in a certain sense the equivalent of an eternal punishment; this may help us to see better how <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> permits the sinner to fall into hell &#151; how a man who sets at naught all Divine warnings, who fails to profit by all the patient forbearance <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has shown him, and who in wanton disobedience is absolutely bent on rushing into eternal punishment, can be finally permitted by <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> just indignation to fall into hell.</li></ul></div>

<p>In itself, it is no rejection of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> to suppose that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> might at times, by way of exception, liberate a <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> from hell. Thus some argued from a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation of <a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#vrs19">1 Peter 3:19 sq.</a>, that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> freed several damned <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> on the occasion of His descent into hell. Others were misled by untrustworthy stories into the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> that the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> rescued the <a href="15015a.htm">Emperor Trajan</a> from hell. But now <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> are unanimous in teaching that such exceptions never take place and never have taken place, a teaching which should be accepted. If this be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, how can the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> in the <a href="11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the Mass for the dead: "Libera animas omnium fidelium defunctorum de poenis inferni et de profundo lacu" etc.? Many think the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> uses these words to designate <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. They can be explained more readily, however, if we take into consideration the peculiar spirit of the <a href="09306a.htm">Church's liturgy</a>; sometimes she refers her <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> not to the time at which they are said, but to the time for which they are said. Thus the offertory in question is referred to the moment when the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is about to leave the body, although it is actually said some time after that moment; and as if he were actually at the death-beds of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> implores <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to preserve their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> from hell. But whichever explanation be preferred, this much remains certain, that in saying that offertory the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> intends to implore only those <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> which the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is still capable of receiving, namely, the grace of a <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> death or the release from <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Impenitence of the damned</h2>

<p>The damned are confirmed in <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>; every act of their will is <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> and inspired by <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. This is the common teaching of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> sets it forth in many passages. Nevertheless, some have held the opinion that, although the damned cannot perform any <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> action, they are still able to perform, now and then, some naturally good deed; thus far the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has not condemned this opinion. The author of this article maintains that the common teaching is the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> one; for in hell the separation from the sanctifying power of Divine <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> is complete. Many assert that this inability to do <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> is physical, and assign the withholding of all grace as its proximate cause; in doing so, they take the term grace in its widest meaning, i.e. every Divine co-operation both in natural and in <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> good actions. The damned, then, can never choose between acting out of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and virtue, and acting out of <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Hatred is the only motive in their power; and they have no other choice than that of showing their <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by one <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> action in preference to another. The last and the real cause of their impenitence is the state of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> which they freely chose as their portion on earth and in which they passed, unconverted, into the next life and into that state of permanence (<em>status termini</em>) by nature due to <a href="12673b.htm">rational</a> creatures, and to an unchangeable attitude of mind. Quite in consonance with their final state, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> grants them only such cooperation as corresponds to the attitude which they freely chose as their own in this life. Hence the damned can but hate <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and work <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, whilst the just in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> or in <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, being inspired solely by <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, can but do good. Therefore, too, the works of the reprobate, in as far as they are inspired by <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, are not formal, but only material <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, because they are performed without the liberty requisite for moral imputability. Formal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> the reprobate commits then only, when, from among several actions in his power, he deliberately chooses that which contains the greater malice. By such formal <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> the damned do not incur any essential increase of punishment, because in that final state the very possibility and Divine permission of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> are in themselves a punishment; and, moreover, a sanction of the moral law would be quite meaningless.</p>

<p>From what has been said it follows that the <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> which the lost <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> bears to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in its cause only; and the cause is the deliberate <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> which it committed on earth and by which it merited reprobation. It is also obvious that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not responsible for the reprobate's material <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> of hate, because by granting His co-operation in their <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a> acts as well as by refusing them every incitement to good, He acts quite in accordance with the nature of their state. Therefore their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> are no more imputable to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> than are the <a href="02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of a man in the state of total intoxication, although they are not uttered without Divine assistance. The reprobate carries in himself the primary cause of impenitence; it is the guilt of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> which he committed on earth and with which he passed into <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>. The proximate cause of impenitence in hell is <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> refusal of every grace and every impulse for good. It would not be intrinsically impossible for <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to move the damned to repentance; yet such a course would be out of keeping with the state of final reprobation. The opinion that the Divine refusal of all grace and of every incitement to good is the proximate cause of impenitence, is upheld by many <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and in particular by Molina. Francisco Su&aacute;rez considers it probable. <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a> and Vasquez hold similar views. Even the Fathers and <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> may be understood in this sense. Thus St. Thomas teaches (De verit., Q. xxiv, a.10) that the chief cause of impenitence is Divine <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> which refuses the damned every grace. Nevertheless many <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, e.g. Francisco Su&aacute;rez, defend the opinion that the damned are only morally incapable of good; they have the physical power, but the difficulties in their way are so great that they can never be surmounted. The damned can never divert their attention from their frightful torments, and at the same time they <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that all hope is lost to them. Hence despair and <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, their just Judge, is almost inevitable, and even the slightest good impulse becomes morally impossible. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has not decided this question. The present author prefers Molina's opinion.</p>

<p>But if the damned are impenitent, how can Scripture (<a href="../bible/wis005.htm">Wisdom 5</a>) say they repent of their <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>? They deplore with the utmost intensity the punishment, but not the malice of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>; to this they cling more tenaciously than ever. Had they an opportunity, they would commit the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> again, not indeed for the sake of its gratification, which they found illusive, but out of sheer <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. They are ashamed of their folly which led them to seek <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not of the malice of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> itself (<a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, Theol. comp., c. cxxv).</p>

<h2 id="section5"><em>Poena damni</em></h2>

<p>The <em>poena damni</em>, or pain of loss, consists in the loss of the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> and in so complete a separation of all the powers of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> that it cannot find in Him even the least peace and rest. It is accompanied by the loss of all <a href="06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>, e.g. the loss of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. The characters impressed by the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> alone remain to the greater confusion of the bearer. The pain of loss is not the mere absence of superior bliss, but it is also a most intense positive pain. The utter void of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> made for the enjoyment of <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="06636b.htm">goodness</a> causes the reprobate immeasurable anguish. Their consciousness that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, on Whom they entirely depend, is their enemy forever is overwhelming. Their consciousness of having by their own deliberate folly forfeited the highest <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a> for transitory and delusive pleasures humiliates and depresses them beyond measure. The desire for <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> inherent in their very nature, wholly unsatisfied and no longer able to find any compensation for the loss of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in delusive pleasure, renders them utterly miserable. Moreover, they are well aware that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="08004a.htm">infinitely</a> <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a>, and hence their <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> and their impotent desire to injure Him fills them with extreme bitterness. And the same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> with regard to their <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of all the friends of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> who enjoy the bliss of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The pain of loss is the very core of eternal punishment. If the damned beheld <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> face to face, hell itself, notwithstanding its fire, would be a kind of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Had they but some union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> even if not precisely the union of the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, hell would no longer be hell, but a kind of <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. And yet the pain of loss is but the natural consequence of that aversion from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> which lies in the nature of every mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section6"><em>Poena sensus</em></h2>

<p>The <em>poena sensus</em>, or pain of sense, consists in the torment of fire so frequently mentioned in the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Bible</a>. According to the greater number of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> the term <em>fire</em> denotes a material fire, and so a real fire. We hold to this teaching as absolutely <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> and correct. However, we must not forget two things: from Catharinus (d. 1553) to our times there have never been wanting <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> who interpret the Scriptural term fire metaphorically, as denoting an incorporeal fire; and secondly, thus far the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has not censured their opinion. Some few of the <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> also thought of a metaphorical explanation. Nevertheless, Scripture and tradition speak again and again of the fire of hell, and there is no sufficient reason for taking the term as a mere metaphor. It is urged: How can a material fire torment <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a>, or human <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> before the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>? But, if our <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is so joined to the body as to be keenly sensitive to the pain of fire, why should the <a href="11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> be unable to bind even pure spirits to some material substance in such a manner that they suffer a torment more or less similar to the pain of fire which the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> can feel on earth? The reply indicates, as far as possible, how we may form an <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the pain of fire which the <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a> suffer. <a href="14580a.htm">Theologians</a> have elaborated various theories on this subject, which, however, we do not wish to detail here (cf. the very minute study by Franz Schmid, "Quaestiones selectae ex theol. dogm.", <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1891, q. iii; also Guthberlet, "Die poena sensus" in "Katholik", II, 1901, 305 sqq., 385 sqq.).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It is quite superfluous to add that the nature of hell-fire is different from that of our ordinary fire; for instance, it continues to burn without the need of a continually renewed supply of fuel. How are we to form a conception of that fire in detail remains quite undetermined; we merely <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that it is corporeal. The <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a> suffer the torment of fire, even when, by Divine permission, they leave the confines of hell and roam about on earth. In what manner this happens is uncertain. We may assume that they remain fettered inseparably to a portion of that fire.</p>

<p>The pain of sense is the natural consequence of that inordinate turning to creatures which is involved in every mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is meet that whoever seeks forbidden pleasure should find pain in return. (Cf. Heuse, "Das Feuer der H&ouml;lle" in "Katholik", II, 1878, 225 sqq., 337 sqq., 486 sqq., 581 sqq.; "Etudes religieuses", L, 1890, II, 309, report of an answer of the Poenitentiaria, 30 April, 1890; Knabenbauer, "In Matth., xxv, 41".)</p>

<h2 id="section7">Accidental pains of the damned</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a> the pain of loss and the pain of sense constitute the very essence of hell, the former being by far the most dreadful part of eternal punishment. But the damned also suffer various "accidental" punishments.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Just as the blessed in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> are free from all pain, so, on the other hand, the damned never experience even the least real pleasure. In hell separation from the blissful influence of Divine <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> has reached its consummation.</li><li>The reprobate must live in the midst of the damned; and their outbursts of <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> or of reproach as they gloat over his sufferings, and their hideous presence, are an ever fresh source of torment.</li><li>The reunion of <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and body after the <a href="12792a.htm">Resurrection</a> will be a special punishment for the reprobate, although there will be no essential change in the pain of sense which they are already suffering.</li></ul></div>

<p>As to the punishments visited upon the damned for their venial <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, cf. Francisco Su&aacute;rez, "De peccatis", disp. vii, s. 4.</p>

<h2 id="section8">Characteristics of the pains of hell</h2>

<p>(1) The pains of hell differ in degree according to demerit. This holds <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> not only of the pain of sense, but also of the pain of loss. A more intense <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, a more vivid consciousness of utter abandonment by Divine <a href="06636b.htm">goodness</a>, a more restless craving to satisfy the natural desire for beatitude with things external to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, a more acute sense of shame and confusion at the folly of having sought <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> in earthly enjoyment &#151; all this implies as its correlation a more complete and more painful separation from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>(2) The pains of hell are essentially immutable; there are no temporary intermissions or passing alleviations. A few Fathers and <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, in particular the poet Prudentius, expressed the opinion that on stated days <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> grants the damned a certain respite, and that besides this the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the faithful obtain for them other occasional intervals of rest. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has never condemned this opinion in express terms. But now <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> are justly unanimous in rejecting it. <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> condemns it severely (In IV Sent., dist. xlv, Q. xxix, cl. 1). [Cf. Merkle, "Die Sabbatruhe in der H&ouml;lle" in "Romische Quartalschrift" (1895), 489 sqq.; see also Prudentius.]</p>

<p>However, accidental changes in the pains of hell are not excluded. Thus it may be that the reprobate is sometimes more and sometimes less tormented by his surroundings. Especially after the last judgment there will be an accidental increase in punishment; for then the <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a> will never again be permitted to leave the confines of hell, but will be finally imprisoned for all <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>; and the reprobate <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of men will be tormented by union with their hideous bodies.</p>

<p>(3) Hell is a state of the greatest and most complete misfortune, as is evident from all that has been said. The damned have no <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> whatever, and it were better for them if they had not been born (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs24">Matthew 26:24</a>). Not long ago <a href="10407b.htm">Mivart</a> (The Nineteenth Century, Dec., 1892, Febr. and Apr., 1893) advocated the opinion that the pains of the damned would decrease with time and that in the end their lot would not be so extremely sad; that they would finally reach a certain kind of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> and would prefer existence to annihilation; and although they would still continue to suffer a punishment symbolically described as a fire by the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, yet they would hate <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> no longer, and the most unfortunate among them be happier than many a pauper in this life. It is quite obvious that all this is opposed to Scripture and the teaching of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The articles cited were condemned by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office on 14 and 19 July, 1893 (cf. "Civilt&agrave; Cattolica", I, 1893, 672).</p>
