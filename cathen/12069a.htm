<h2>Diocese of Piacenza (Placentinensis)</h2>

<p>Piacenza is a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in Emilia, central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated on the right of the Po, near its junction with the Trebbia, in an important strategic position. Agriculture is the chief industry. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is of the ninth century; it was remodelled by Santa da Sambuceto and others (1122-1223) in beautiful Lombard style. The campanile, over 216 feet high, is surmounted by an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a>, in brass; the <a href="04569d.htm">cupola</a> is a more recent part of the edifice; there are frescoes by Guercino and by <a href="10095c.htm">Morazzone</a>, <a href="03374c.htm">Ludovico Carracci</a>, Procaccino, and others. Its Cappella del Crocifisso has an arch with <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of <a href="10752c.htm">Nero</a> and of <a href="15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>; the Cappella di S. Corrado has an admirable Madonna by Zitto di Tagliasacchi, and contained once a picture of St. Conrad by <a href="08786a.htm">Lanfranco</a>, but it was taken to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Among the churches is S. Antonio (fourth century), many times restored; until 877 it was the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; in 1183 the preliminaries of the Peace of Constance were concluded in this church; here also are <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Procaccino, Mulinaretto, Novoloni etc.; the <a href="13322b.htm">sacristy</a> contains a triptych with the <em>gesta</em> of S. Antonio. In the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor's</a> residence of S. Andrea there is an ancient <a href="10584a.htm">mosaic</a>. S. Bartolommeo, formerly a church of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, contains besides its beautiful <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> two crucifixes, one very ancient, the other <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1601. S. Francesco (1278) has beautiful columns, but has been disfigured by incongruous restorations; it contains a Piet&agrave; by Bernardo Castelli, a Madonna by Francia, and the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the famous <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Francesco Mairone (1477). S. Giovanni in Canali (1220), formerly of the <a href="14493a.htm">Templars</a>, and later of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, has also been disfigured by its restorations; it contains <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> and <a href="02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Scotti <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and of the physician Gulielmo da Saliceto. S. Savino (903) was restored several times and entirely transformed in the eighteenth century; formerly there was a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> annexed to it; in its recent restorations, <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the fourteenth century were discovered, and also pillars and other <a href="13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of the original construction, as well as <a href="10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, a crucifix carved in wood, and other objects. Outside the city the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Cassinesi <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, S. Sisto, founded in 874 by Queen Angilberga, is a veritable sanctuary of art; the famous Sistine Madonna by <a href="12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, was first here, but was sold by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, to obtain funds for repairs. Santa Maria in Campagna contains a very ancient <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> in marble of <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, four <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> in wood by Hermann Geernaert, and <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Procaccino, <a href="12280a.htm">Pordenone</a>, Guercino, and others.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The Palazzo Ducale, a work of <a href="15428a.htm">Vignola</a> (1558), has since 1800 served as a barracks. The Palazzo Anguissola da Grazzano contains fine <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a>. The Palazzo Brandini has a gallery of <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Correggio, <a href="12771a.htm">Reni</a>, Guercino, Andrea del Sarto, and <a href="10644a.htm">Murillo</a>. The Palazzo Landi contains <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="05220b.htm">Van Dyck</a>. The Palazzo Palastrelli has a <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of works on the history of Piacenza. Cardinal Alberoni established in this town a famous college. Its church has <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="03169b.htm">Paolo Veronese</a>, <a href="12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, and others. The Piazza de Cavalli has equestrian <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of Alessandro and of Ranuccio I, Farnese, by Mocchi da Montevarchi.</p>

<p>Placentia, with <a href="04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, was founded in 218 B. C., to hold in check the Gauls after their defeat near Clastidium. The Via &AElig;milia terminated there. Scipio, defeated near the Trebbia, retreated to this town. In 206 it was besieged in vain by Hasdrubal and burned by the Gauls in 200. There Emperor Otho defeated Vitellius (69) and then <a href="02108b.htm">Aurelian</a> was defeated by the Alamanni (271); there also Emperor Orestes was decapitated (467). The Lombards took possession of it, at the beginning of their invasion, and thereafter it remained in their power. From the ninth century the temporal power was in the hands of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, until the twelfth century, when the town became a commune, governed by consuls, and later (1188), by a podest&agrave;. In the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> between the Lombard cities and with the emperors, Piacenza was an ally of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, on account of its <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="04483a.htm">Cremona</a> and of Pavia; wherefore it was <a href="07056c.htm">Guelph</a> and a party to both of the Lombard leagues. Twice, Uberto Palavicino made himself lord of the city (1254 and 1261), but the free commune was re-established. From 1290 to 1313, Alberto Scotti was lord of Piacenza; his rule had many interruptions, as in 1308, by Guido della Torre of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, in 1312, by Henry VII. The latter's vicar, Galeazzo Visconti, was expelled by the pontifical <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> Bertrando del Poggetto (1322-35). In 1336 Piacenza came again under the rule of the dukes of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>; between 1404 and 1418 they were compelled to retake the city on various occasions. In 1447 there was a new attempt to re-establish independent government. The fortunes of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> gave Piacenza to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1512; in 1545 it was united to the new Duchy of <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a>. After the assassination of Pier Luigi Farnese, which occurred at Piacenza (1547), the city was occupied by the troops of the imperial governor of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and was not restored to the Duchy of <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> for ten years. In 1746 the Austrians obtained a great victory there over the French and <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, and in 1799 the Russians and Austrians defeated the French. <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> made <a href="09106a.htm">Lebrun</a> Duke of Piacenza.</p>

<p>St. Antonius, who is said to have belonged to the Theban Legion, suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at Piacenza, in the second or third century. The first known <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is St. Victor, present at the <a href="13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (343); St. Savinus, present at <a href="01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> (381), was probably the Savinus to whom <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> wrote several letters. Other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="10072a.htm">St. Maurus</a>, St. Flavianus, St. Majorianus (451). Whether the emperor of this name intended to become <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Piacenza is uncertain; he was not its <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, having been killed soon after his abdication. Joannes was a contemporary of <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>; Thomas (737) was very influential with King Luitprand; Podo (d. 839) was <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> with a metrical epitaph; Guido (904), a man of arms rather than of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; Boso (940) freed himself from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (re-established by <a href="06790a.htm">Gregory V</a>), and became the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="08428a.htm">John XVI</a>; Pietro (1031) was exiled to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by Conrad II; Dionisio was deposed in 1076 by <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>; <a href="02673a.htm">St. Bonizo</a> (1088), who had been <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sutri and a great supporter of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, was killed in 1089; during the incumbency of Aldo (1096), Emilia was temporarily taken from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>; Arduino (1118) founded the new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Ugo (1155), a nephew of <a href="01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>, was driven from his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the schismatics; under Ardizzone (1192) and Grumerio (1199) grave contentions began between the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the consuls, and Grumerio was driven from the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Orlando da Cremona, O.P., was mortally wounded by a Catharist while preaching (1233); P. Alberto Pandoni (1243), an Augustinian; Pietro Filargo (1386) became <a href="01288a.htm">Pope Alexander V</a>; Pietro Maineri (1388) was formerly the physician of Galeazzo II; Branda Castiglione (1404) was a professor of law at <a href="11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, and took part in the conciliabulum of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and in the <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, and became a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; Alessio da Siregno (1412) was a famous preacher; Fabrizio Marliani (1476) was very <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the reform of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> in the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and in the people; Cardinal Scaramuzza Trivulzio (1519); Catalano Trivulzio (1525); Cardinal Giovanni Bernardino Scotti (1559) was a very learned <a href="14557a.htm">Theatine</a>; the Bl. Paolo Burali (1570), a <a href="14557a.htm">Theatine</a>, became a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; Cardinal Filippo Sega (1578); Alessandro Scappi (1627) was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the duchy for having <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the duke, Odoardo; Alessandro Pisani's election (1766) was one of the causes of dissension with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; Stefano Fallot de Beaumont (1807) was present at the national council of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1810). Bl. Corrado (d. at <a href="11126a.htm">Noto</a> in 1351) was from Piacenza. The councils of Piacenza were those of 1076 (concerning the schismatics against <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>), 1090 (<a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a> against the <a href="04207a.htm">concubinage</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and in favour of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>), 1132 (<a href="08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> against <a href="01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>). There were ten <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> under Bishop Marliani (1476-1508).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1582 the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was made a suffragan of Bologna; it is now immediately dependent upon the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It has 350 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 310,000 inhabitants, 11 <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for men, and 29 for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, 5 <a href="13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> for male students, and 18 for girls, 1 daily paper, and 1 monthly periodical. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> has a house of missionaries for emigrants established by the late <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr. Scalabrini.</p>

<h2>University of Piacenza</h2>

<p>Piacenza was the first Italian city to apply for a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> erecting its town-schools into a <em>studium generale</em>, which <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> was granted by <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> in 1248, and conferred all the usual privileges of other <em>studia generalia</em>; by it the power of giving degrees was vested in the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Piacenza. But no practical work was done here until 1398, when Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and Pavia, refounded the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> in his capacity of Vicar of the Empire. The <a href="11593a.htm">University of Pavia</a> was suppressed, as he did not wish to have a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> in either of his capitals. Gian Galeazzo liberally endowed Piacenza, organizing a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> of jurists as well as a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> of arts and medicine, each with an independent <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. Between 1398 and 1402 seventy-two salaried professors are recorded as having lectured, including not only the usual professors of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, medicine, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and grammar, but also the new chairs of <a href="02018e.htm">astrology</a>, rhetoric, <a href="04628a.htm">Dante</a>, and Seneca. But this endeavour to establish a large <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> in a small town which had no natural influx of students was doomed to failure, and little or no work was done after Gian Galeazzo's death in 1402. In 1412 Pavia had its <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> restored, and the subjects of the duchy were forbidden to study elsewhere. Piacenza then obtained an unenviable <a href="11126b.htm">notoriety</a> as a market for cheap degrees. This traffic was still flourishing in 1471, though no lectures had been given for sixty years. A college of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of arts and medicine, however, maintained a shadowy existence for many years later. Among the famous teachers at Piacenza may be named the jurist Placentinus, founder of the law-school at <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> (d. there 1192); and Baldus (b. 1327), the most famous jurist of his day (Muratori, "Rer. It. SS.", XX, 939).</p>
