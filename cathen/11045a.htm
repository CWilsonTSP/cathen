<p>Seventh <a href="04423f.htm">Ecumenical Council</a> of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, held in 787. (For an account of the controversies which occasioned this council and the circumstances in which it was convoked, see <a href="07620a.htm">ICONOCLASM</a>, Sections I and II.) An attempt to hold a council at Constantinople, to deal with <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>, having been frustrated by the <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> soldiery, the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a> left that city. When, however, they had reached <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> on their way back to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, they were recalled by the Empress Irene. She replaced the mutinous troops at Constantinople with troops commanded by officers in whom she had every confidence. This accomplished, in May, 787, a new council was convoked at Nicaea in Bithynia. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> letters to the empress and to the patriarch (see <a href="07620a.htm">ICONOCLASM</a>, II) prove superabundantly that the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> approved the convocation of the Council. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> afterwards wrote to <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>: "Et sic synodum istam, secundum nostram ordinationem, fecerunt" (Thus they have held the synod in accordance with our directions).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The empress-regent and her son did not assist in person at the sessions, but they were represented there by two high officials: the patrician and former consul, Petronius, and the imperial chamberlain and logothete John, with whom was associated as secretary the former patriarch, Nicephorus. The acts represent as constantly at the head of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> members the two Roman <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a>, the <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> Peter and the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> Peter; after them come Tarasius, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and then two Oriental <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, John and Thomas, representatives of the Patriarchs of Alexandria, <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The operations of the council show that Tarasius, properly speaking, conducted the sessions. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> John and Thomas professed to represent the Oriental <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, though these did not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that the council had been convoked. However, there was no <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a> on their part: they had been sent, not by the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, but by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of superior rank acting <em>sedibus impeditis</em>, in the stead and place of the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> who were prevented from acting for themselves. Necessity was their excuse. Moreover, John and Thomas did not subscribe at the Council as vicars of the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, but simply in the name of the Apostolic sees of the Orient. With the exception of these <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and the Roman <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a>, all the members of the Council were subjects of the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. Their number, <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> as well as representatives of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, varies in the ancient historians between 330 and 367; Nicephorus makes a manifest mistake in speaking of only 150 members: the Acts of the Council which we still possess show not fewer than 308 <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> or representatives of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. To these may be added a certain number of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, <a href="01695c.htm">archimandrites</a>, imperial secretaries, and <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> of Constantinople who had not the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to vote.</p>

<p>The first session opened in the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sophia, 24 September, 787. Tarasius opened the council with a short discourse: "Last year, in the beginning of the month of August, it was desired to hold, under my presidency, a council in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Apostles at Constantinople; but through the fault of several <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom it would be easy to count, and whose names I prefer not to mention, since everybody knows them, that council was made impossible. The sovereigns have deigned to convoke another at <a href="11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>, and Christ will certainly reward them for it. It is this Lord and Saviour whom the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> must also invoke in order to pronounce subsequently an equitable judgment in a just and impartial manner." The members then proceeded to the reading of various official documents, after which three <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had retracted were permitted to take their seats. Seven others who had plotted to make the Council miscarry in the preceding year presented themselves and declared themselves ready to profess the Faith of the Fathers, but the assembly thereupon engaged in a long discussion concerning the admission of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> and postponed their case to another session. On 26 September, the second session was held, during which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> letters to the empress and the Patriarch Tarasius were read. Tarasius declared himself in full agreement with the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> set forth in these letters. On 28, or 29, September, in the third session, some <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had retracted their <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> were allowed to take their seats, after which various documents were read. The fourth session was held on 1 October. In it the secretaries of the council read a long series of citations from the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> and the Fathers in favour of the veneration of images. Afterwards the dogmatic <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> was presented, and was signed by all the members present, by the <a href="01695c.htm">archimandrites</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and by some <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>; the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a> added a declaration to the effect that they were ready to receive all who had abandoned the <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclastic heresy</a>. In the fifth session on 4 October, passages form the Fathers were read which declared, or seemed to declare, against the worship of images, but the reading was not continued to the end, and the council decided in favour of the restoration and veneration of images. On 6 October, in the sixth session, the doctrines of the <em>conciliabulum</em> of 753 were refuted. The discussion was endless, but in the course of it several noteworthy things were said. The next session, that of 13 October, was especially important; at it was read the <em>horos</em>, or dogmatic decision, of the council [see <a href="07664a.htm">VENERATION OF IMAGES</a> (6)]. The last (eighth) was held in the Magnaura Palace, at Constantinople, in presence of the empress and her son, on 23 October. It was spent in discourses, signing of names, and acclamations.</p>
