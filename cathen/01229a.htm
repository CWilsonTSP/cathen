<p>(Or, according to her conventual title, Maria of Jesus)</p>

<p>A discalced <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a>; born 1602; died 24 May, 1665. Her family name was Coronel, but she is commonly known as Maria de Agreda, from the little town in <a href="03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>, on the borders of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, where some ancestor, it is said, had built a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in obedience to commands conveyed in a revelation. La Fuente, in his <em>Historia eclesiastica de Espa&ntilde;a</em>, says the Coronels were <em>una virtuosa y modesta familia de aquel pueblo.</em> By some writers they are described as noble, but impoverished. Maria is said to have made a <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity at the age of eight, but no importance need be attached to that, as, naturally, she could not have known the character of such an <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and we are not compelled to suppose any divine guidance in case the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> was made. She and her mother entered the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> together, January, 1619, and simultaneously her father and two brothers became <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a>. When only twenty-five, in spite of her unwillingness, she was made <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, by <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. This was almost eight years after her entrance. With the exception of an interval of three years, she remained superior all her life. Under her administration the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, which was in a state of decay, rose to great material prosperity, and at the same time became one of the most fervent in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. She died with the reputation of a saint; and the cause of her <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> was introduced by the Congregation of Rites, 21 June, 1672, at the request of the Court of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. This was only seven years after her death. What has given her prominence, however, is not so much the <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of her life, about which there seems to be general consent, as the character of one of her writings known as <em>La m&iacute;stica ciudad de Dios, historia divina de la Virgen, Madre de Dios.</em> This "Divine History of the Mother of God" was first conceived in 1627; that is to say, nine years after she became a <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a>. Ten years later, by the express command of her confessor, she set to work at it, and in twenty days wrote the first part, consisting of 400 pages. Although it was her desire to prevent its publication, a copy of it was sent to Philip IV, to whom she wrote a great number of letters in the course of her life, and who had expressed a desire to have it. Later on, in obedience to another confessor, she threw it and all her other writings, into the fire, without any apparent repugnance. A third command of a <a href="05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, in 1655, resulted in her beginning again, and in 1660 she finished the book. It was not, however, given to the world until five years after her death. It was printed in <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, in 1670. Its lengthy title contains no less than ninety words. "The Mystical City" purports to be the account of special revelations, which the author declares were made to her by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, Who, after raising her to a state of sublime contemplation, commanded :her to write it, and then revealed to her these profound mysteries. She declares that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> gave her at first six <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> to guide her, the number being afterwards increased to eight, who, having purified her, led her into the presence of the Lord. She then beheld the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, as she is described in the Apocalypse, and saw also all the various stages of her life: how when she came into the world <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> ordered the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> to transport her into the empyrean <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, appointing a hundred spirits from each of the nine choirs to attend her, twelve others in visible and corporeal form to be always near her, and eighteen of the most splendid to be ambassadors perpetually ascending and descending the Ladder of Jacob. In the twentieth chapter she describes all that happened to the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> during the nine months she was in her mother's womb; and tells how, when she was three years old, she swept the house with the help of the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>. The fifteenth chapter enters into many details, which by some were denounced as indecent. The style, in the opinion of certain critics, is elegant, and the narrative compact. G&ouml;rres, on the other hand, while expressing his admiration for the wonderful depth of its speculations, finds that the style is in the bad taste of the period, pompous and strained, and very wearisome in the prolixity of the moral applications appended to each chapter.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The book did not attract much attention outside of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> until Croset, a Recollect friar, translated and published the first part of it, at <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, 1696. This was the signal of a storm, which broke out especially in the Sorbonne. It had already been condemned in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 4 August, 1681, by the Congregation of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> had forbidden the reading of it, but, at the instance of Charles II, suspended execution of the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> for <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. But Croset's translation transgressed the order, and caused it to be referred to the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, 2 May, 1696. According to <a href="07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, <em>Kirchengeschichte</em> (trad. franc., 1892, V, vi, p. 418), it was studied from the 2d to the 14th of July, and thirty-two sessions were held during which 132 <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> spoke. It was condemned 17 July, 102 out of 152 members of the commission voting against the book. It was found that</p>

<blockquote><p>it gave more weight to the revelations alleged to have been received than to the mystery of the Incarnation; that it adduced new revelations which the Apostles themselves could not have supported; that it applied the term 'adoration' to Mary; that it referred all her <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> to the Immaculate Conception; that it attributed to her the government of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; that it designated her in every respect the Mother of Mercy and the Mediatrix of Grace, and pretended that St. Ann had not contracted <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> in her birth, besides a number of other imaginary and <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> assertions. </p></blockquote>

<p>This censure was confirmed on the 1st of October. The <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="01232c.htm">Cardinal Aguirre</a>, although a friend of <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> who fully approved the censure, strove to have it annulled, and expressed his opinion that the Sorbonne could easily do so, as their judgment was. based on a bad translation. <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> denounced it as "an impious impertinence, and a trick of the <a href="04764a.htm">devil</a>." He objected to its title, <em>The Divine Life</em>, to its <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> stories, its indecent language, and its exaggerated <a href="13610b.htm">Scotist</a> philosophy. However, although this appreciation is found in <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> works (<em>&OElig;uvres</em>, <a href="15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, 1817, XXX, pp. 637-640, and XL, pp. 172 and 204-207), it is of questionable authenticity. As to the reproach of indecency, her defenders allege that, although there may be some crudities of expression Which more recent times would not admit, it is absurd to bring such an accusation against one whose <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> is generally conceded. Near investigations of the book were made in 1729, under <a href="02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, when her <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> was again urged. On 16 January, 1748, <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, in a letter which La Fuente, in his <em>Historia eclesi&aacute;stica de Espa&ntilde;a</em>, finds <em>"sumamente curiosa"</em>, wrote to the General of the Observantines instructing him as to the investigation of the authenticity of the writings, while conceding that the book had received the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the Universities of Salamanca, Alcal&aacute;, <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. It had meantime been fiercely assailed by <a href="01434a.htm">Eusebius Amort</a>, a canon of Pollingen, in 1744, in a work entitled <em>De revelationibus, visionibus, et apparitionibus privatis, regulae tutae</em>, which, though at first imperfectly answered by Mathes, a <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, and by Maier, a <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, to both of whom Amort replied, was subsequently refuted in another work by Mathes, who showed that in eighty places Amort had not understood the Spanish text of Maria de Agreda. With Mathes, in this exculpation, was P. Dalmatius Kich, who published, at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 1750, his <em>Revelationum Agredanarum justa defensio, cum moderamine inculpatae tutelae.</em> <a href="07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, in his <em>Kirchengeschichte</em> (trad. franc., VI, p. 416 &#151; V. Palm&eacute;, Paris, 1892), informs us that the condemnation of the book by the Roman <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, in 1681, was thought to have come from the fact either that, in its publication, the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, of 14 March, 1625, had been disregarded, or because it contained <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> stories, and maintained opinions of the <a href="13610b.htm">Scotist</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> as Divine revelations. Some blamed the writer for having said that she saw the earth under the form of an egg, and that it was a globe slightly compressed at the two poles, all of which seemed worthy of censure. Others condemned her for exaggerating the devotion to the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and for obscuring the mystery of the Incarnation. The <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> were surprised at the reception the book met with in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, especially as the <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> had given it fourteen years of study before pronouncing in its favor. As noted above, the suspension of the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, condemning the book, was made operative only in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and although Charles II asked to have the permission, to read it extended to the whole of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, <a href="01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a> not only refused the petition, but confirmed the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of his predecessor. The King made the same request to innocent XII, who did nothing, however, except to institute a commission to examine the reasons alleged by the Court of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The King renewed his appeal more urgently, but the Pope died without having given any decision.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>La Fuente, in his <em>Historia eclesi&aacute;stica de Espa&ntilde;a</em> (V, p. 493), attributes the opposition to the impatience of the <a href="14698b.htm">Thomists</a> at seeing <a href="13610b.htm">Scotist</a> doctrines published as revelations, as if to settle various <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> controversies in the name of the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and in the sense of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, to whose order Agreda belonged. Moreover, it was alleged that her confessors had tampered with the text, and had interpolated many of the <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> stories which were then current, but her most bitter enemies respected her virtues and holy life, and were far from confounding her with the deluded <em>illuminatae</em> of that period. Her works had been put on the Index, but when the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> protested they were accorded satisfaction by being assured that it was a trick of the printer (<em>supercheria</em>), as no condemnation appeared there.</p>

<p>The other works of Maria de Agreda are:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>her letters to Philip IV of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> edited by Francisco Silvela;</li><li><em>Leyes de la Esposa conceptos y suspiros del coraz&oacute;n para alcanzar el &uacute;ltimo y verdadero fin del agrado del Esposo y Se&ntilde;or</em>;</li><li><em>Meditaciones de la pasi&oacute;n de nuestro Se&ntilde;or&eacute;</em>;</li><li><em>Sus exercicios quotidianos</em>;</li><li><em>Escala Espiritual para subir &aacute; la perfecci&oacute;n.</em></li></ol></div>

<p>The <em>M&iacute;stica ciudad</em> has been translated into several languages; and there are several editions of the correspondence with Philip IV; but the other writings are still in <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, either in the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Agreda, or in the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Quaracchi in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>
