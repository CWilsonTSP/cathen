<p>Ancient Catholic Diocese of Durham (Dunelmensis).</p>

<p>This diocese holds a unique position among English <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. Owing to its geographical position on the Scottish border, the successive <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were led to assume constitutional and political functions in addition to their spiritual office. Consequently their <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges were peculiar and extensive; and even to this day the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Durham has precedence over all other <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> except those of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, and <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the lineal continuation of the Anglo-Saxon <a href="09269a.htm">See of Lindisfarne</a>, founded by <a href="01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a> in 635, when he came from the <a href="08090a.htm">monastery of Iona</a> at the request of St. Oswald, King of Northumbria, to evangelize that newly conquered <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> kingdom. He built his <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Island of Lindisfarne, now Holy Island, off Northumbria. Thus Northumbrian <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was of Celtic origin and followed the Celtic use as to the observance of <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and other matters. But in the south the Roman use prevailed and conflict became inevitable. The controversy arose in the time of St. Colman, the third <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and was settled in 664 at the <a href="15610a.htm">Synod of Whitby</a> when the Roman use was adopted. Shortly after, St. Colman resigned the episcopate and the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred to <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, with <a href="15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 678, St. Theodore, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, cut off from it two new sees, one for the Lundiswaras of Lincolnshire and the other for Bernicia. In 680 the Bernician see was subdivided into the Dioceses of <a href="09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> and <a href="07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, while finally a separate <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was created for the Southern Pics. So that when <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a> the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was only a fragment of what it had been under <a href="01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a>. In the ninth century when the Danes repeatedly harassed Northumbria, the Diocese of <a href="07318b.htm">Hexham</a> ceased to have a separate existance, and about 820 was merged in that of York. In 875, Eardulf, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, was driven from his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, and taking the body of <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>, he with his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> fled from the Danes. After wandering seven years they found a resting place at Chester-le-Street (882); and from here Eardulf and his eight immediate successors ruled the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. In 995 Bishop Aldhun again found himself defenseless before the Danes and fled with <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> body to Ripon. When peace was restored, he was returning to Chester-le-Street when <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> signs were given that the body of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> was to remain where the city of Durham now stands. A stone <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built to receive the remains of <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> body and Aldhun began a great church where the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> now is, which was finished and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 999. In this way Aldhun became the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Durham.</p>

<h2>The cathedral</h2>

<p>The first Norman <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Walcher, was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the people in 1080, and was succeeded by William de S. Carilef, who began the present <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the foundation being laid 29 July, 1093. He also replaced the secular <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> by <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> from Jarrow and <a href="15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a>. The situation of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is very remarkable, as it stands high on the cliff overhanging the river, and the building itself is most imposing, with its noble proportions, and what Dr. Johnson called its appearance of "rocky solidity and of indeterminate duration". Bishop Carilef died shortly after beginning it; but the building was carried on with energy by the next <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="08001a.htm">infamous</a> Rannulf Flambard. He built the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> and <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a> and the lower part of the west front, and in 1104 the shrine of <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> was transferred to the new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1143 the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was usurped by William Cumin, chancellor of the King of <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, who for sixteen months <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a> kept the rightful <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> out of possession. This interfered with the building, but the next <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Hugh de Pudsy, was a great builder, and among his additions is the "Galilee Chapel", a unique specimen of transitional work. Another special feature of Durham <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the eastern <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a>, <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> as the "Chapel of Nine Altars", built by Bishop Poor about 1230. The central tower (214 feet) was rebuilt towards the end of the fifteenth century. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> also built their own half-regal residence, Durham Castle, and the extensive buildings of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, portions of which still remain. The relations between the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were frequently very strained, especially in the time of the warrior-prelate, Antony Beck, though <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> like Richard Poor, Richard de Kellaw, or the scholar <a href="13042b.htm">Richard de Bury</a>, lived in harmony with them.</p>

<h2>Civil jurisdiction of the bishopric of Durham</h2>

<p>The twofold <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Durham was clearly recognized by the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> from early times. In the reign of Edward I the Rolls of Parliament state: "Episcopus Dunelmensis duos habet status, videlicet, statem episcopi quoad spiritualia et statum comitis palacii quoad tenementa sua temporalia." But the original of this <a href="02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> has never been ascertained. According to one theory it represents local survival of the old Northumbrian Kingdom. According to another view it was conferred by grant of some king, Alfred or, more plausibly, William the Conqueror. There is however, no historical trace of such grant, and recent research makes it more probable that it is a development of <a href="07690a.htm">immunities</a> granted to the Bishopric of Durham. Even before the Conquest the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> held large endowments of land known as the patrimony of <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>, <em>Terra</em> or <em>Patrimonium Sancti Cuthbert</em>. Therefore the diocese possessed large franchise or immunity both as against the sovereign power of the King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and the local <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Earl of Northumberland. Thus the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was not included in the Domesday Book, and even at the time of the Conquest the county of Durham was governed by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> with almost complete local independence. These extreme <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> were strengthened by the fact that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> frequently had to repel Scottish invasions, by their own forces and at their own expense, which fostered both the military and financial independence of the palatinate. The strong feeling of Northumbrian independence also prevented the formation of any firm ties with the English sovereigns, until the masterful policy of Henry II brought Durham into subordination to the central government. But this subordination was exceedingly limited even then, and the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> escaped the deprivation of its privileges which befell many other franchises at that time. This was due to Bishop Hugh de Pudsey, who was the king's cousin and personal friend, and who took care as time went on to obtain the charters <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to safeguard the liberties of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>.</p>

<p>These were most considerable. First, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> had within the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> every right that the king had in the country: <em>Quicquid rex habet extra episcopus habet intra</em>. He was therefore the head of the civil government, with appointment of all civil officers. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> writ, not the king's, ran within the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, and the "Bishop's peace" was regarded as different from the "King's peace" until the time of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. Offenders and lawbreakers were tried in the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> court and if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> punished by his officials. Forfeiture for treason and forfeitures of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> were both his right, and he could create corporations, and erect fairs and markets. He did not, however, have the right of making treaties with foreign powers, though instances of attempted secret treaties with <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a> are not wanting. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had their own mint, and their <a href="11152a.htm">coinage</a> bears their initials on the reverse of each coin. From the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> point of view the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were very strong, as he was the universal landlord, and all land was held mediately or immediately of him and not of the king. From this follows his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of wardship, <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> to all mines and to treasure-trove, as well as his extensive forest <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. At law he could stay procedure against offenders, grant pardons, and even suspend the application of a statute. He had courts of <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a>, equity, and admiralty, besides his spiritual courts; and he regulated the relations between the latter and the temporal courts.</p>

<p>Thus, in theory, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was as a king in his <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, but in practice his power was limited by the sovereign. In some instances the king actually infringed upon his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, and in other cases there was conflict of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Up to the end of the thirteenth century the episcopal power developed in every way, then followed a period during which the kings somewhat unwillingly tolerated the position, for the sake of the convenience of having what amounted to a buffer state between <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and also because it was difficult to solve a problem so beset with complications both <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a>. Although it is sometimes stated that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had a council in the nature of a parliament, it is becoming increasingly clear that we have here a confused tradition of two separate bodies &#151; the assembly and the council. The assembly (communitas) was practically the same gathering as the shiremoot in other counties. It raises money by taxation at both the request of the king and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and sometimes for its own purposes. But it was not a legislative assembly, since all general legislation applied to the palatinate, although Durham was not represented in Parliament till the time of the Stuarts. When Acts were not intended to apply to Durham express exemption was stated. The council was in origin a <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> body, chosen from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> immediate followers and officials, the functions entrusted to it being the general administration of the palatinate, financial affairs, and the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of advising the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The judicial courts of the palatinate arose out of this body. Much of the civil and judicial independence of the palatinate was destroyed by the Act of Resumption passed in 1536, at the will of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. By this act the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> semi-regal power was abolished. The see at this time was held by <a href="15091a.htm">Cuthbert Tunstall</a>, the venerable <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> who was the last <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and who lived to witness the suppression of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, The <a href="12084b.htm">Pilgrimage of Grace</a> (1536), and finally the surrender of Durham Abbey (1540) which involved the spoliation of <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> shrine. During the reign of Edward VI he was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and an Act of Parliament was passed dissolving the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and forming it into a county palatinate. After the brief respite of Mary's reign. <a href="15091a.htm">Bishop Tunstall</a> was deprived of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> by Elizabeth, July, 1559. With his death in confinement, on 18 Nov., the line of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> ended. Ten years later during the "Rising of the North" the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> seized Durham <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, restored the altar, and publicly celebrate <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>, thus making it the last of the old <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> in which Mass has been said.</p>

<p>In the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> there were six collegiate churches, <a href="02068a.htm">Auckland</a>, Darlington, Chester-le-Street, Lanchester, Norton, and Staindrop. The <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> held Durham Abbey, with the dependent houses of Jarrow, <a href="15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a>, and Finchale. There were Augustinians at <a href="07318b.htm">Hexham</a> and Brinkburn; <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Newminster; and <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> at Blanchland. Durham College (now Trinity), at <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, was greatly protected and helped by various <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a> of Durham, and possibly was originally a Durham foundation. The arms of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> are: azure, a cross between four lions rampant, or. The miter over the arms is encircled by a ducal coronet.</p>
