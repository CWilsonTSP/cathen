<p>(PUERTO RICO)</p>

<p>The smallest and most easterly of the Greater Antilles, rectangular in shape, with an area of 3670 square miles, and the most densely inhabited country in America, having a population of 1,118,012, over 304 to the square mile, according to the census of 1910; a growth of 125,769 the last ten years.</p>

<p>On 16 Nov., 1493, on his second voyage, the mountain El Yunque, on the north-east coast of the island then known as Boriquen, was seen by <a href="04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, whose fleet anchored in the port near Aguadilla. A monument erected in the fourth century of the discovery marks the site between Aguada and Aguadilla, where presumably the admiral took possession of the newly discovered territory in the name of his sovereign. The island was named San Juan in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>.</p>

<p>Among those who accompanied <a href="04140a.htm">Columbus</a> was Vincent Ya&ntilde;ez, the younger of the brothers Pinzon, who had commanded the ill-fated "Ni&ntilde;a" on the voyage of the year previous. In 1499 a royal permit was granted him to fit out a fleet to explore the region south of the lands discovered by <a href="04140a.htm">Columbus</a>. After coasting along the shores of <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a> and advancing up the River Amazon, then called Mara&ntilde;on, he returned by way of Hispaniola, to be driven for refuge from storm into the port of Aguada.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From the natives, who received him kindly, it was learned that there was considerable gold in the island. On his return to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Pinzon sought to obtain certain privileges to colonize San Juan de Boriquen. It was only after the death of Isabella that he obtained a royal permit from Ferdinand the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 24 April, 1505, authorizing him to colonize the island of San Juan de Boriquen, without intervention on the part of <a href="04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, on condition that he would secure means of transportation within one year. Failing to do so his permit was without effect.</p>

<p>The colonizer and first governor of the island was another companion of <a href="04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, <a href="12228a.htm">Juan Ponce</a>, surnamed de Leon after his birth-place in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The eastern portion of the Island of Hispaniola (Haiti), separated from Porto Rico by the Mono Channel, was at this time under his command.</p>

<p>In 1508 he secured permission to leave his command in the province of Higuey, in Hispaniola, and to explore San Juan de Boriquen. With fifty chosen followers, he crossed the channel, landing in Porto Rico 12 Aug., 1508, and was received by a friendly native cacique, who informed him of the existence of the harbour of San Juan on the north coast, then unknown to <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, which de Leon named "Puerto Rico" on account of the strategic and commercial advantages it offered for the colonization and civilization of the island. Having explored its interior, de Leon returned to his command in Hispaniola, now the eastern portion of <a href="13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, to arrange with King Ferdinand and Orando to lead an expedition for the conquest and colonization of Boriquen. He made special request to have a body of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> assigned for his assistance.</p>

<p>In March, 1509, he sailed direct to the north coast for the harbour which he had named Puerto Rico, now known as San Juan. Anchoring about one mile from the entrance he established the first <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> settlement at a place then known as Caparra, now Pueblo Viejo, which remained capital of the island until it was officially transferred to the present site of San Juan in 1519.</p>

<h2>Erection of the first dioceses in the new world</h2>

<p>On 15 Nov., 1504, <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a> by <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Illius fulciti" erected in the Island of Hispaniola the first <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> in the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a>, comprising the archiepiscopal See of Hyaguata, dedicated to the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, under the title of Our Lady of the Annunciation, with two suffragans of Magua and Bayuna. This <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, however, remained without effect, on account of inconveniences attending the sites selected, and of the opposition of King Ferdinand, who objected to the concession to the first <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a> the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to participate in the <em>diezmos</em> (<a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>) upon gold, silver, and precious stones then being discovered within the territory. This rendered the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> inoperative, because in 1501 <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> had granted to the Crown of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in perpetuity the right of collecting <em>diezmos</em> in her transoceanic colonies.</p>

<p>Seven years later, 8 Aug., 1511, the same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Pontifex Romanus" declared as suppressed and extinguished in perpetuity the aforementioned <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, with the three sees comprised therein, and by the same <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> erected three new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: two in Hispaniola (Santo Domingo and Concepci&oacute;n de la Vega); the third was in the Island of San Juan, the name now given solely to the chief city of Porto Rico, but which then applied to the whole island. The new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were made suffragans of the Province of Seville, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the three <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> previously designated to rule the extinct sees of 1504 were assigned by this later <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> to the new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> without the right, however, of sharing the <em>diezmos</em> upon any gold, silver, or precious stones that might be discovered within the limits of their <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.</p>

<p>Father Alonso Manso, Canon of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Salamanca, who had been elected <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the See of Magua, was transferred by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1511 to the newly-erected See of San Juan, of which he took possession two years later in 1513, arriving at a time when the island possessed only two <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> settlements, some two hundred white people and about five hundred native <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. According to a letter which this <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> addressed later to the Spanish monarch, he was the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to reach the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a>, a statement, however, that is at variance with the opinion that <a href="03397a.htm">Father Bartholomew de las Casas</a> had been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1510 in <a href="13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, though it may be that he only sang his first <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> in America, as there is no record of the presence of any <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> there to ordain him at that early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Bishop Manso was the first Inquisitor General of the Indies, appointed in 1519 by Cardinal Adrian de Utrecht, afterwards <a href="01159b.htm">Pope Adrian VI</a> (1522). The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> made this appointment in the name of the Regent of Castile, whom he represented while <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>. <a href="12603a.htm">Juan de Quevedo</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Darien, is credited with having planted the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in America in 1515, but Bishop Manso was the first to be entitled "General Inquisitor of the Indies, Islands and the Mainland", with authority to act outside the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in union with the Vice-Provincial of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Pedro de Cordoba, who resided in <a href="13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, until the establishment in 1522 of the Convent of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, the first <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> community in Porto Rico. There is no evidence that this tribunal interfered in matters appertaining to the Holy Office outside the Diocese of San Juan. At least it did not interfere with the various <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in their respective <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, who either <em>sui juris</em> or as delegates of the Holy Office exercised their functions in this regard.</p>

<p>It also has been stated that to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Manso, was assigned a number of Indians in the <em>repartimiento</em> made by the Crown, and that successive <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had retained a number of natives as <em>Encomiendas</em> to care for the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; but the aborigines in Porto Rico were always well treated by the early missionaries, who included <a href="03397a.htm">Las Casas</a>. In fact <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, as early as 1537, declared <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> all who dared to enslave the Indians in the newly-discovered lands, deprive them uf their lands or fortunes, or disturb their tranquillity on the pretext that they were <a href="11388a.htm">heathens</a>.</p>

<p>In 1519, at the request of Bishop Manso, who complained that the revenue derived from San Juan was insufficient for his support, the Crown obtained from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> an extension of territory for the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, so as to include all the Windward Islands of the Lesser Antilles from Santa Cruz to Dominica, thus rendering the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> coextensive with the civil and military sway of the first governor and colonizer, <a href="12228a.htm">Juan Ponce de Leon</a>. The Islands of Margarita and Cubagua were also added to the diocese during the episcopate of Rodrigo de Bastidas, who was transferred in the <a href="04285a.htm">Consistory</a> of 6 July, 1541, from the See of Coro, <a href="15327a.htm">Venezuela</a>, to succeed Manso. On the appointment of Nicolas Ramos, 12 Feb., 1588, fifth <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of San Juan, the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was further extended to embrace the Island of Trinidad, and that tract of mainland in Venezuela which comprises Cumana and the region between the Amazon and the Upper Orinoco reaching almost to the present city of Bogota. Gradually the various islands were severed from the Spanish Crown and were made independent of the See of San Juan, which, on the erection of the Diocese of Guyana in Venezuela (1791), was restricted wholly to the limits of the Island of Porto Rico. At present the two small islands of Vieques and Culebra (the latter now a <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> naval station) remain part of the See of Porto Rico. Over this ancient diocese, now within the territory of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, fifty <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> have ruled, several of whom were born in the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a>, one in the city of San Juan itself, Arizmendi, co-founder of the <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, who died on one of the arduous visitations of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>.</p>

<p>The first church was erected in 1511 at Caparra, and by order of King Ferdinand was dedicated to <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. The edifice was a temporary structure, which fell into ruin on the transfer of the capital. In 1512 a like structure was erected for the inhabitants on the southern coast at a point known as San German, some distance from the actual site of the town of that name. For many years the Diocese of Porto Rico had only these two centres of worship, with little increase in population, owing to the larger opportunities then found in Mexico and South America.</p>

<p>The location of the actual <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of San Juan marks the site of the first church there erected in 1520 or 1521 by Bishop Manso. This wooden structure was replaced by Bishop Bastidas, who began the work in 1543, and in the year following informed the king that the building was still unfinished for lack of funds; that he "was assisted by the new dean, by four beneficiaries, some <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, and an able provisor". Again in 1549 the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> informed the same sovereign that the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, upon which had already been spent more than six thousand <em>castellanos,</em> was still unfinished; that he had celebrated a synod, and that the <em>diezmos</em> amounted to six thousand pesos payable every four years on instalments. Successive structures have been destroyed by cyclones, earthquakes, and foreign invaders, to be replaced by others, each surpassing in beauty the former and continuing for four centuries on this spot the hallowed sanctuary of the mother church of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>.</p>

<p>The present <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which is comparatively modern in its principal part, dates back to the early part of the eighteenth century. The rear portion, however, gives evidence of a distinct style of architecture of a much more remote period. On 12 August, 1908, the remains of <a href="12228a.htm">Don Juan Ponce de Leon</a> were solemnly conveyed from the church of San Jos&eacute; to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, where a suitable monument now marks the resting place of the intrepid soldier and <a href="03691a.htm">Christian cavalier</a>.</p>

<h2>Church and state</h2>

<p>On the withdrawal of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> from Porto Rico, and the assumption by the <a href="07380a.htm">United States</a> of control over the island, many problems arose affecting the welfare of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. For four centuries the civil and religious authorities had been intimately associated, first by reason of the right of patronage over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Indies conferred on the kings of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> by <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a> in 1508, and then by reason of the existing concordat.</p>

<p>Three distinct <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a> or solemn agreements between the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the kings of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> had been drawn up at various times relative to the mutual interests of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in Porto Rico. The first was <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 May, 1418, between <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> and John II of Castile. The second, between Philip V and <a href="08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a>, may be regarded as the forerunner of the agreement made 2 January, 1753, by <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and Ferdinand VI, which remained the basis of the union of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and her colonies until the death of Ferdinand VII in 1833.</p>

<p>That concordat recognized in a solemn manner the right of patronage as appertaining to the Crown, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in consequence reserving to itself fifty-two <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> for its own appointment without any intervention of the State.</p>

<p>On the accession of Isabella II her adherents seemed to assume that <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was unfavourable to the new dynasty, and, together with a vast portion of the <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, was leaning towards the pretender Don Carlos. Eventually there followed a complete rupture with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In the subsequent civil <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> opportunity was afforded the Isabellists to despoil the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of her <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and suspend the allowances guaranteed by the Crown for the maintenance of religion.</p>

<p>Porto Rico felt in a very special manner the effects of this. In 1833 the saintly Bishop Pedro Gutierrez de Cos had died, leaving the diocese vacant until the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> in 1846 of Bishop Francisco de La Puente, O.S.D. During this interval the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was subjected to violent measures on the part of the governors of the island, who, taking advantage of its unsettled condition and of the Laws of Confiscation (applicable only to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>), despoiled the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of much <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> and disbanded the only two communities of religious men, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, appropriating to the State their <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> and properties.</p>

<p>On 8 May, 1849, the Cortes authorized the Government to conclude a new concordat with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. This was done, 17 Oct., 1851, and, with modifications duly admitted in amendments (1859, 1867), was the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of Porto Rico at the time when it passed under American rule. The Spanish captain-general, besides being civil and military governor of the island, was also vice patron of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The question of the patronage previously exercised by the Crown of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> seemed to offer little difficulty; on the part of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, there was no disposition to avail itself of this privilege, nor did the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> desire to have the civil or military government intervene in matters spiritual. The continuance of the concordat as to the support of Divine worship and its <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> was not claimed by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> from the new government. It was tacitly admitted by both parties that the nature of the American Government made such continuance impossible. With this understanding the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, through its <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>, Archbishop Chapelle, proceeded. But &iuml;t was urged that the new government, in extending its authority over Porto Rico, should fulfil all <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> towards the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>The maintenance of religion and its <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and her colonies was not an act of mere <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> or generosity towards the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, but a partial and meagre compensation to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> for repeated spoliations, particularly during the last century. On the acceptance by the Spanish Government of its <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to support religion and its <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, particularly <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, had condoned many past acts of spoliation. In view of this act of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in Porto Rico could not reclaim anything from the American Government, But there were certain <a href="12466a.htm">church properties</a>, particularly the former possessions of the now suppressed communities of religious men, which, by the distinct agreement between the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Crown, should have been surrendered to the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; these, however, still remain in possession of the government. Both in <a href="04558c.htm">Cuba</a> and in Porto Rico claims were made for properties which in every sense of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> belonged to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, though administered by the government, which was repeatedly pledged by the terms of the concordat to restore the same to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>The support of religion was the only title whereby in the past usufruct of these properties by the Crown of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> could have been condoned; the failure of the American Government to assume this <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> deprived it of all title or pretext to these holdings.</p>

<p>Hence the <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>, Archbishop Chapelle, and the then <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Porto Rico, Right Rev. James H. Blenk, made claim to the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> Government for the devolution of these properties or their equivalent, together with a rental of the edifices from the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the American occupation of Porto Rico, as well as a small amount of <em>censos</em>. The <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> military government in Cuba had speedily adjusted a similar claim involving a much larger amount, through the appointment of a commission. The prompt establishment of civil government in Porto Rico <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> Bishop Blenk to appeal to the civil tribunals on account of a special act of the legislature (12 March, 1904) conferring original <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> upon the Supreme Court of the island to determine all questions at issue with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. This measure immediately led to a series of civil suits which involved the claim here mentioned as well as the ownership of the properties of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the episcopal residence, the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> building, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, several <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, and the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a>. By the people of Porto Rico the claims of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> were not disputed, except the properties formerly belonging to the suppressed communities, which <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> had held for the last half century, allowing the suits in other cases to pass by default in favour of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> question was therefore duly brought before the Supreme Court of the island, which, after a long delay, handed down a decision by a vote of three to two, sustaining in principle the claims of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. From this decision an appeal was made to the Supreme Court of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the municipality of Ponce, unwilling to be guided by the policy of the insular Government, insisted upon laying claim to the two <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches of that city, alleging that a goodly portion of the cost of the said edifices had been paid for with its funds. This suit was presented to the Supreme Court of the island, where judgment was given in favour of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and then carried immediately to Washington for a final decision. The importance of this matter was far in excess of the value of the properties at issue, for it involved not only ownership of nearly every church in the island, but also was bound largely to determine the outcome of the suit still pending before the same court in reference to all other <a href="12466a.htm">church properties</a>. The question of the bearing of the Concordat of 1851 upon the actual situation was most serious, involving the future security of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the island.</p>

<p>In June, 1908, Chief Justice Fuller handed down a decision confirming the sentence obtained by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> before the Supreme Court of the island against the municipality of Ponce, which was greatly enhanced by the luminous declaration contained in his opinion, upholding the force of the Concordat as an ancient law of the island and establishing beyond <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> the judicial <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> of the head of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in Porto Rico, without being required to register under the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> governing business corporations.</p>

<p>This decision was accepted by the Porto Rican Government as a forerunner of a favourable outcome for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in its appeal then pending before the same court in reference to the properties in question. As the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> Government, both at Washington and in Porto Rico, was concerned in this decision, it was agreed by all parties interested to abide by the sentence of a commission appointed by President Roosevelt, composed of two members for the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, two for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and two for the Porto Rican Government.</p>

<p>Under the presidency of Robert Bacon, then assistant secretary of state, an agreement was speedily reached by the commission in August, 1908, by which the settlement of eleven claims at issue between the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on one side and the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and Porto Rican Government on the other was made on a basis of equity, whereby the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was assured the sum of about $300,000 for the release to the State of the properties involved in litigation.</p>

<p>More than one-half this sum was paid from insular funds, for which the approval of the Porto Rican Government was obtained in the following month. The part of the total sum that was apportioned to the Federal Government for properties utilized by the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> Army was likewise ratified by Congress in the following session, and approved by the President of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, thus terminating in an amicable manner a vexed question agitated for more than ten years and involving the only available income for the impoverished diocese.</p>

<p>The Diocese of Porto Rico at present is comprised of 78 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, which with few exceptions have resident <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, a large number of whom are members of the religious bodies. The <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, Augustinians, and <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> from <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> from <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> from <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, are each doing invaluable service for the preservation of the Faith. The people are poor and unaccustomed to contribute to the support of their religion and its <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>. The amount received from the Government is invested so as to provide a limited annuity for aiding <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the poorer missions, and assisting in the support of <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. About 300 <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> belonging to the different <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities are located in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, engaged chiefly in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. The <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, Sisters of Charity, Religious of the Sacred Heart, and <a href="09750a.htm">Servants of Mary</a> were established in Spanish times; since the American occupation the Mission Helpers of the Sacred Heart have erected an asylum for the deaf and dumb, and taken charge of the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; the Sisters of St. Francis, from <a href="03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, New York, have founded two <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and a <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for the reception of <a href="12319b.htm">postulants</a>. The <a href="12354c.htm">Sisters of St. Dominic</a>, of <a href="02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York, are in charge of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Bayamon, having been sent to the island by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a> at the personal request of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>. By the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> Actum Pr&aelig;clar&aelig; of 20 Feb., 1903, the Diocese of Porto Rico was severed from the province of Santiago de Cuba, and made <a href="05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the two islands still continuing under the direction of the one <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>.</p>

<p>On 8 Aug., 1911, the Diocese of San Juan will have completed the fourth centenary of its foundation. Extensive plans are devised for the proper celebration of this event. Apart from the contemplated renovation of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, it is hoped to establish a beneficent institution which will include a manual training <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for both boys and girls.</p>
