<p>(OR CAMOENS)</p>

<p>Born in 1524 or 1525; died 10 June, 1580. The most sublime figure in the history of <a href="12307a.htm">Portuguese literature</a>, Cam&otilde;es owes his lasting fame to his epic poem "Os Lusiadas," (The Lusiads); he is remarkable also for the degree of art attained in his lyrics, less noteworthy for his dramas. A wretched exile during a large part of his lifetime, he has, like <a href="04628a.htm">Dante</a>, enjoyed an abundance of fame since his death; his followers have been legion, and his memory has begot many fabulous legends. Actual facts regarding his career are not easily obtained. There are but few documentary sources of information regarding him, and these are concerned simply (1) with the trifling pension which King Sebastian bestowed upon him and which Philip II continued in favour of his mother, who survived him; (2) with his <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> as a result of an assault made by him upon a public official; and (3) with the publication of "The Lusiads". Personal references contained in various letters and in his literary works, all of a certain autobiographical value, provide further data.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Cam&otilde;es came of a reduced noble <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. The place of his birth has been the subject of contention, but in all probability he was born at Coimbra. He belonged to the same stock as the noted explorer, <a href="06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a>, who is so important in "The Lusiads". His father was a sea-captain who died at <a href="06602a.htm">Goa</a> in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> as the result of a shipwreck, soon after the birth of Luiz. It seems likely that the poet received his training at the <a href="04095c.htm">University of Coimbra</a>, where his uncle, Bento de Cam&otilde;es, was chancellor for several years. Some early <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> lyrics, <a href="12159a.htm">Platonic</a> of inspiration and <a href="11778a.htm">Petrarchian</a> in form, date back to his college days. Passing to the court at <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, he there fell in <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> with Catherina de Athaide, a lady of the queen's suite. Catherina, the Natercia (anagram of Caterina) of his lyrics, responded to his suit, but those in authority opposed it, and Cam&otilde;es, meeting their resistance with words of wrath and violent deeds, was ere long banished from the court. For two or three years, that is between 1546 and 1549, he fought in the campaign in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> and there lost one of his eyes, which was struck by a splinter from a cannon. Back once again in <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, he found himself utterly neglected, and in his despair he proceeded to lead a disorderly life. Wounding an officer of the royal court, he was incarcerated for some months and was released in March of 1553 only on condition that he go to <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> as a soldier. Forthwith he departed, a private in the ranks, on his way to the region which his great kinsman had made known to the Occident. In the East his career was full of the greatest vicissitudes. At one time fighting valiantly against the natives, he was again languishing in jail on a charge of malfeasance in office while occupying a governmental post in Macao; he entered into a new <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> affair with a native, either before or soon after the death of Catherina (1556); now rolling in wealth, he was again overwhelmed with <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>, and he was always gaining more enemies by his too ready pen and tongue; seldom stationary anywhere for long, he engaged in long journeys which took him as far as Malacca and the Moluccas, and upon one occasion he escaped death by shipwreck only through his powers as a swimmer. Finally, in 1567, he began the return trip to <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. Stopping at <a href="10610a.htm">Mozambique</a> in his course, he there spent two years, a prey to disease and dire poverty. With the help of generous friends he continued his journey and reached <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1570, after an absence of sixteen years. There was no welcome for <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal's</a> greatest bard in a capital that had just been visited by plague, and was governed by that visionary and heedless young monarch, Dom Sebastian; but Cam&otilde;es, publishing his epic, dedicated it to the king and was rewarded with a meagre royal pension. His last gloomy years were spent near his aged mother, and he died, heart-broken at the misfortune that had come to his beloved land with the great disaster of Alcacer-Kebir, where Sebastian and the flower of the <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> nobility went to their doom.</p>

<p>It is possible that Cam&otilde;es had conceived the purpose of writing an epic poem as early as his student days, and there are reasons for supposing that he had composed some passages of "The Lusiads" before 1544; but in all likelihood the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of making <a href="06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama's</a> voyage of discovery the central point of his work occurred first to him during the voyage to <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> in 1553. During that trip and on the return, with the delay at <a href="10610a.htm">Mozambique</a>, he could acquire that familiarity with the ocean and with the coast of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> which is clear in some of his most striking octaves; but it was during the long sojourn in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> that he gave shape to the major part of the epic. Adapting a metrical form &mdash; the octave &mdash; of which the Italian <a href="01712b.htm">Ariosto</a> had <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> the pliancy, and modelling his epic style on that of Vergil, Cam&otilde;es set up as his hero the whole Lusitanian people, the sons of Lusus, whence the title, "Os Lusiadas". His purpose was a serious one; he desired to abide by the sober reality of his country's history, which, in poetic speech, is related in a long series of stanzas by <a href="06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a> himself. From first to last the ten cantos of the work glow with patriotic fervour inspired by the genuine achievements of the poet's compatriots. but, side by side with chronicled fact, there appears also a somewhat complicated mythological machinery. Venus, the friend of the wandering Portuguese; Bacchus, their enemy; Mars, Jupiter, <a href="04683a.htm">deities</a> of the sea, and a number of symbolical figures play a large part in the fortunes of <a href="06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama's</a> nautical expedition, and at times the union of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> and <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> fable is carried to absurd extremes, as when Bacchus is made to assume the form of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and offer a feigned worship to the <a href="06608a.htm">Christian God</a>. For the introduction of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> mythology into a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> and historical epic Cam&otilde;es has been harshly censured by many; yet it must be admitted that much of the charm of the poem is to be found in just those parts in which the mythological elements abound. It is interesting, furthermore, to note that the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, as represented by the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Ferreira, who examined the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> and gave the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> permission to print the book, found nothing contrary to <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> in it; the mythology was regarded as a mere poetic fiction. The action of the poem is not of great extent, yielding often to passages of narration and description; of course it is developed in accord with the events of <a href="06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama's</a> voyage along the African coast to Mombaca and Melinde, on to Calicut in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>, and back again over the ocean to <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> The chief edition of "The Lusiads" is that of 1572, prepared by the poet himself; the modern editions still leave much to be desired in the way of critical apparatus.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It has been the lot of Cam&otilde;es, the epic bard, to be more talked of and written about by foreigners than he is read by them. Hence the uncertainty of opinion regarding his proper rank among modern poets. There is, however, no need of depreciating <a href="01712b.htm">Ariosto</a>, or <a href="14463d.htm">Tasso</a>, or any others who have essayed the epic, in order to render to Cam&otilde;es his just <a href="04749a.htm">deserts</a>. In artistic feeling and accomplishments he is doubtless not the equal of several among them; as the exponent of patriotic <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> in national endeavour and sturdy enterprise, and as the greatest master of Portuguese poetic style and diction, he will ever command the admiration of his countrymen and of all who <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> what is best in literature. The mass of lyrics still attributed to Cam&otilde;es requires much deliberate sifting; fully a fifth part of it is probably not his work. The poems that may with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> be ascribed to him follow, as has been said, the <a href="11778a.htm">Petrarchian</a> model. They comprise sonnets, odes, elegies, eclogues, <em>can&ccedil;&otilde;es, redondilhas</em>, and the like, and in sentiment reflect the moods and passions of the poet's mind and heart throughout the periods of his varied and ill-starred life. He produced three comedies in verse, which are of decided merit as compared with the pieces hitherto written in Portuguese, but yet show no transcendent powers as a dramatist on his part. One of them, the "Filodemo", gives scenic setting to the plot of a <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> story of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> and adventurous travel; another, the "Rei Seleuco", takes up a <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> episode in the life of the Syrian King Seleucus and his son Antiochus, which had been narrated by Plutarch and treated by <a href="11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> and many other poets; the third and best of all, the "Enfatri&otilde;es" (or "Amphitry&otilde;es"), is a free and attractive rendering of the "Amphitruo" of Plautus.</p>
