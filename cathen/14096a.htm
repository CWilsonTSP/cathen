<p>The Suppression is the most difficult part of the history of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. Having enjoyed very high favor among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peoples, kings, <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> for two centuries and a half centuries, it suddenly becomes an object of frenzied hostility, is overwhelmed with obloquy, and overthrown with dramatic rapidity. Every work of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> &#151; their vast missions, their noble colleges, their churches &#151; all is taken from them or destroyed. They are banished, and their order suppressed, with harsh and denunciatory words even from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. What makes the contrast more striking is that their protectors for the moment are former enemies &#151; the Russians and Frederick of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Like many intricate problems, its solution is best found by beginning with what is easy to understand. We look forward a generation, and we see that every one of the thrones, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> not excluded, which had been active in the Suppression is overwhelmed. <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> become, and indeed still are, a prey to the extravagance of the Revolutionary movement. The Suppression of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> was due to the same causes which in further development brought about the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. These causes varied somewhat in different countries. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, many influences combined, as we shall see, from <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> to <a href="06258b.htm">Free-thought</a>, to the then prevalent impatience with the old order of things (see <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, VI, 172). Some have thought that the Suppression was primarily due to these currents of thought. Others attribute it chiefly to the absolutism of the Bourbons. For, though in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the king was averse to the Suppression, the destructive forces acquired their power because he was too indolent to exercise control, which at that time he alone possessed. Outside <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> it is plain that autocracy, acting through high-handed <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>, was the determining cause.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Portugal</h2>

<p>In 1750, Joseph I of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> appointed Sebastian Joseph Carvalho, afterwards <a href="16075a.htm">Marquis of Pombal</a> as his first minister. Carvalho's quarrel with the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> began with a quarrel over an exchange of Territory with <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. San Sacramento was exchanged for the Seven Reductions of Paraguay which were under <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The <a href="14081a.htm">Society's</a> wonderful missions there were coveted by the Portuguese, who believed the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were mining gold. So the Indians were ordered to quit their country; and the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> endeavored to lead them quietly to the distant land allotted to them. But owing to the harsh conditions imposed, the Indians rose in arms against the transfer, and the so-called <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of Paraguay ensued, which, of course, was disasterous to the Indians. Then step by step the quarrel with the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> was pushed to extremities. The weak king was persuaded to remove them from Court; a <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of pamphlets against him was commenced; the Fathers were first forbidden to undertake the temporal administration of the missions, and then they were deported from America.</p>

<p>On 1 April 1758, a brief was obtained from the aged <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, appointing Cardinal Saldanha to investigate the allegations against the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, which had been raised in the King of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal's</a> name. But it does not follow that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had forejudged the case against the order. On the contrary, if we take into view all the letters and instructions sent to the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, we see that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was distinctly skeptical as to the gravity of the alleged abuses. He ordered a minute inquiry, but one conducted so as to safeguard the reputation of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. All matters of serious importance were to be referred back to himself. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> died five weeks later on 3 May. On 15 May, Saldanha, having received the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> only a fortnight before, omitting the thorough house-to-house visitation that had been ordered, and pronouncing on the issues which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had reserved to himself, declared that the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were guilty of having exercised illicit, public, and <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> commerce both in <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and in its colonies. Three weeks later, at <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal's</a> instigation, all faculties were withdrawn from the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> throughout the patriachate of <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. Before <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> had become <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (6 July, 1758) the work of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> had been destroyed, and in 1759 it was civilly suppressed. The last step was taken in consequence of a plot against the chamberlain Texeiras, but suspected to have been aimed at the king, and of this the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were supposed to have approved. But the grounds of suspicion were never clearly stated, much less <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>. The height of <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal's</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> was reached with the burning (1761) of the saintly <a href="09565c.htm">Father Malagrida</a>, ostensibly for <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>; while the other Fathers, who had been crowded into <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a>, were left to perish by the score. Intercourse between the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was broken off till 1770.</p>

<h2>France</h2>

<p>The Suppression in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> was occasioned by the injuries inflicted by the English navy on French commerce in 1755. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries held a heavy stake in <a href="09731a.htm">Martinique</a>. They did not and could not trade, that is, buy cheap to sell dear, any more than any other religious. But they did sell the products of their great mission farms, in which many natives were employed, and this was allowed, partly to provide for the current expenses of the mission, partly in order to protect the simple, childlike natives from the common plague of dishonest intermediaries. P&egrave;re Antoine* La Vallette, superior of the Martinique missions, managed these transactions with no little success, and success encouraged him to go too far. He began to borrow money to work the large undeveloped resources of the colony, and a strong letter from the governor of the island <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 1753 is extant in praise of his enterprise. But on the outbreak of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, ships carrying goods of an estimated value of 2,000,000 <em>livres</em> were captured and he suddenly became a <a href="02252b.htm">bankrupt</a>, for very large sum. His creditors were egged on to demand payment from the <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but he, relying on what certainly was the letter of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, refused responsibility for the <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> of an independent mission, though offering to negotiate for a settlement, for which he held out assured hopes. The creditors went to the courts, and an order was made (1760) <a href="11189a.htm">obliging</a> the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> to pay, and giving leave to distrain in the case of non-payment.</p>



<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The Fathers, on the advice of their lawyers, appealed to the <em>Grand'chambre</em> of the <em>Parlement</em> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. This turned out to be an imprudent step. For not only did the <em>Parlement</em> support the lower court, 8 May, 1761, but having once gotten the case into its hands, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society's</a> enemies in that assembly determined to strike a great blow at the order. Enemies of every sort combined. The <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> were numerous among the <em>gens-de-robe</em>, and at that moment were especailly keen to be revenged on the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party. The Sorbonnists, too, the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> rivals of the great teaching order, joined in the attack. So did the Gallicans, the <em>Philosophes</em>, and the <em><a href="05418a.htm">Encyclop&eacute;distes</a></em>. Louis XV was weak and the influence of his court divided; while his wife and children were earnestly in favor of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, his able first minister, the <a href="03694a.htm">Duc de Choiseul</a> played into the hands of the <em>Parlement</em>, and the royal mistress, Madame de Pompadour, to whom the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had refused <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>, was a bitter opponent. The determination of the <em>Parlement</em> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in time bore down all opposition. The attack on the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, as such, was opened by the Janseistic Abb&eacute; Chauvelin, 17 April, 1762, who denounced the Constitution of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> as the cause of the alleged defalcations of the order. This was followed by the <em>compte-rendu</em> on the Constitutions, 3-7 July, 1762, full of misconceptions, but not yet extravagant in hostility. Next day Chauvelin descended to a vulgar but efficacious means of exciting odium by denouncing the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits'</a> teaching and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, especially on the matter of <a href="15108a.htm">tyrannicide</a>.</p>

<p>In the <em>Parlement</em>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits'</a> case was now desperate. After a long conflict with the crown in which the indolent minister-ridden sovereign failed to assert his will to any purpose, the <em>Parlement</em> issued its well-known "<em>Extraits des assertions"</em>, a blue-book, as we might say, containing a congeries of passages from <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists, in which they were alleged to teach every sort of immorality and <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, from <a href="15108a.htm">tyrannicide</a>, magic, and <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, to treason, <a href="14113a.htm">Socinianism</a>, and <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. On 6 August, 1762, the final <em>arr&ecirc;t</em> was issued condemning the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> to extinction, but the king's intervention brought eight month's delay. In favour of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, there had been some striking testimonies, especailly from the French <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the two convocations summoned on 30 November, 1761, and 1 May, 1762. But the series of letters and addresses published by <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> afford a truely irrefragable attestation in favour of the order. Nothing, however, availed to stay the <em>Parlement</em>. The king's counter-edict delayed indeed the execution of its <em>arr&ecirc;t</em>, and meantime a compromise was suggested by the Court. If the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> would stand apart from the order, under a French vicar, with French customs, the Crown would still protect them. In spite of the dangers of refusal the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> would not consent; and upon consulting the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, he (not <a href="13033a.htm">Ricci</a>) used the famous phrase <em>Sint ut sunt, aut non sint</em> (de Ravignan, "Clement XIII", I, 105, the words are attributed to <a href="13033a.htm">Ricci</a> also). Louis's intervention hindered the execution of the <em>arr&ecirc;t</em> against the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> until 1 April, 1763. The colleges were then closed, and by a further <em>arr&ecirc;t</em> of 9 March, 1764, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were required to renounce their <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> under pain of banishment. Only three <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and a few scholastics accepted the conditions. At the end of November, 1764, the king unwillingly signed an edict dissolving the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> throughout his dominions, for they were still protected by some provincial <em>parlements</em>, as Franche-Comt&eacute;, Alsace, and Artois. But in the draft of the edict, he canceled numerous clauses, which implied that the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> was guilty; and writing to <a href="03694a.htm">Choiseul</a>, he concluded with the weak but significant words: "If I adopt the advice of others for the peace of my realm, you must make the changes I propose, or I will do nothing. I say no more, lest I should say too much."</p>

<h2>Spain, Naples, and Parma</h2>

<p>The Suppression in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and its quasi-dependencies, <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and in the Spanish colonies was carried through by autocratic kings and <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>. Their deliberations were conducted in secrecy, and they purposely kept their deliberations to themselves. It is only in late years that a clue has been traced back to Bernardo Tenucci, the anti-clerical minister of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, who acquired a great influence over Charles III before the king passed from the throne of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> to that of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In this minister's correspondence are found all the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> which from time to time guided the Spanish policy. Charles, a man of good moral character, had entrusted his government to the Count Aranda and other followers of Voltaire; and he had brought from <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> a finance minister, whose nationality made the government unpopular, while his exactions led in 1766 to rioting and the publications of various squibs, lampoons, and attacks upon the administration. An extraordinary council was appointed to investigate the matter, as it was declared that people so simple as rioters could never have produced the political pamphlets. They proceeded to take secret information, the tenor of which is no longer known; but records remain to show that in September, the council had resolved to incriminate the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, and that by 29 January 1767, its expulsion was settled. Secret orders, which were to be opened at midnight between the first and second of April, 1767, were sent to the magistrates of every town where a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> resided. The plan worked smoothly. That morning, 6000 <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were marching like convicts to the coast, where they were deported, first to the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, and ultimately to <a href="04396b.htm">Corsica</a>.</p>

<p><a href="14446a.htm">Tanucci</a> pursued a similar policy in <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>. On 3 November the religious, again without trial, and this time without even an accusation, were marched across the frontier into the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, and threatened with death if they returned. It will be noted that in these expulsions, the smaller the state, the greater the contempt of the <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> for any forms of law. The Duchy of <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> was the smallest of the so-called Bourbon courts, and so aggressive in its anti-clericalism that <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> addressed to it (30 January, 1768) a <em>monitorium</em>, or warning, that its excesses were punishable with <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures. At this all parties to the Bourbon "Family Compact" turned in fury against the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and demanded the entire destruction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. As a preliminary, <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> at once drove the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> out of its territories, confiscating as usual all their possessions.</p>

<h2>Clement XIV</h2>

<p>From this time till his death (2 February 1769), <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> was harassed with the utmost rudeness and <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a>. Portions of his states were seized by <a href="15446a.htm">force</a>, he was insulted to his face by the Bourbon representatives, and it was made clear that, unless he gave way, a great <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> would ensue, such as <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> had already commenced. The <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> which followed lasted from 15 Feb. to May 1769. The Bourbon courts, through the so-called "crown cardinals", succeeded in excluding any of the party, nicknamed <em>Zelanti</em>, who would have taken a firm position in defense of the order, and finally elected Lorenzo Ganganelli, who took the name <a href="04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>. It has been stated by <a href="04488a.htm">Cretineau-Joly</a> (<a href="04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>, p. 260), that Ganganelli, before his election, engaged himself to the crown <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> by some sort of stipulation that he would suppress the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, which would have involved an infraction of the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>. This is now disproved by the statement of the Spanish agent Azpuru, who was specially deputed to act with the crown <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. He wrote on 18 May, just before the election, "None of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> has gone so far as to propose to anyone that the Suppression be assured by a written or spoken promise", and just after 25 May he wrote, "Ganganelli neither made a promise nor refused it". On the other hand it seems he did write words, which were taken by the crown <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> as an indication that the Bourbons would get their way with him (de Bernis's letters of 28 July and 20 November, 1769).</p>

<p>No sooner was Clement on the throne than the Spanish court, backed by the other members of the "Family Compact", renewed their overpowering pressure. On 2 August, 1769, <a href="03694a.htm">Choiseul</a> wrote a strong letter demanding the Suppression with two months, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> now made his first written promise that he would grant the measure, but he declared that he must have more time. Then began a series of transaction, which some have not unnaturally been interpreted as a devices to escape by delays from the terrible act of destruction, toward which Clement was being pushed. He passed more than two years in treating with the Courts of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, etc. which would not easily consent to the Bourbon projects. The same ulterior object may perhaps be detected in some of the minor annoyances now inflicted on the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. From several colleges, such as those of <a href="06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, Ferrar, Bologna, and the <a href="08157a.htm">Irish College</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were, after a prolonged examination, ejected with much show of hostility. And there were moments, as for instance after the fall of <a href="03694a.htm">Choiseul</a>, when it really seemed as though the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> might have escaped; but eventually the obstinacy of Charles III always prevailed.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the middle of 1772 Charles sent a new ambassador to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Don Joseph Mo&ntilde;ino, afterwards Count Florida Blanca, a strong, hard man, "full of artifice, sagacity, and dissimulation, and no one more set on the suppression of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>". Heretofore, the negotiations had been in the hands of clever, diplomatic Cardinal de Bernis, French ambassador to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Mo&ntilde;ino now took the lead, de Bernis now coming in afterward as a friend to urge the acceptance of his advice. At last, on 6 September, Mo&ntilde;ino gave in a paper suggesting a line for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to follow, which he did in part adopt, in drawing up the brief of Suppression. By November the end was coming in sight, and in December Clement put Mo&ntilde;ino into communication with a secretary; and they drafted the instrument together, the minute being ready by 4 January, 1773. By 6 February, Mo&ntilde;ino had got it back from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in a form to be conveyed to the Bourbon courts, and by 8 June, their modifications having been taken account of, the minute was thrown into its final form and signed. Still the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> delayed until Monino constrained him to get copies printed; and as these were dated, no delay was possible beyond that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, which was 16 August, 1773. A second brief was issued which determined the manner in which the Suppression was to be carried out. To secure secrecy, one regulation was introduced which led, in foreign countries, to some unexpected results. The <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> was not to be published, <em><a href="15221a.htm">Urbi et Orbi</a></em>, but only to each college or place by the local <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the father-general was confined first, at the English College, then in Castel S. Angelo, with his assistants. The papers of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> were handed over to a special commission, together with its title deeds and store of money, 40,000 <em>scudi</em> (about $50,000), which belonged almost entirely to definite charities. An investigation of the papers was begun, but never brought to any issue.</p>

<p>In the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of Suppression, the most striking feature is the long list of allegations against the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, with no mention of what is favorable; the tone of the brief is very adverse. On the other hand the charges are recited categorically; they are not definitely stated to have been <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>. The object is to represent the order as having occasioned perpetual strife, contradiction, and trouble. For the sake of peace the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> must be suppressed. A full explanation of these and other anomalous features cannot yet be given with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>. The chief reason for them no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> was that the Suppression was an administrative measure, not a judicial sentence based on judicial inquiry. We see that the course chosen avoided many difficulties, especially the open contradiction of preceding <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, who had so often praised or confirmed the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. Again, such statements were less liable to be controverted; there were different ways of interpreting the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> which commended themselves to <em>Zelanti</em> and <em>Bourbonici</em> respectively. The last word on the subject is doubtless that of Alphonsus di Ligouri: "Poor <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>! What could he do in the circumstances in which he was placed, with all the Sovereigns conspiring to demand this Suppression? As for ourselves, we much keep silence, respect the secret judgment of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and hold ourselves in peace".</p>
