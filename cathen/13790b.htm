<h2 id="section1">Prussian Silesia</h2>

<p>Prussian Silesia, the largest province of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, has an area of 15,557 square miles, and is traversed in its entire length by the River Oder. In 1905 the province had 4,942,612 inhabitants, of whom 2,765,394 were <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 2,120,361 <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, and 46,845 <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>; 72.3 per cent were Germans and nearly 25 per cent Poles. Agriculture is in a flourishing <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a>, 66 per cent of the area being under cultivation; the mining of iron, lead, and coal is largely carried on, and the manufacturing industry is considerable; among the articles manufactured are hardware, glass, china, linen, cotton and woollen goods.</p>

<p>In the earliest period Silesia was inhabited by Germans, the tribes being the Lygii and the Silingii. When during the migrations these peoples <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> about the year 400 towards the West, the territory was lost to the Germanic races, and for about eight hundred years the region was Slavonic. The sole memorial of the Silingii is the retention of the name Silesia; the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a> called Mount Zobten near Breslau "Slenz" (<em>Silingis</em>), and the <a href="06393a.htm">Gau</a> surrounding Mount Zobten they called <em>Pagus Silensi</em> or <em>Slenzane, Slenza</em>, Silesia. The region belonged politically at times to <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and at times to <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> came to it from <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Moravia. The apostles of these two countries, Cyril and Methodius (from 863), are indirectly also the apostles of Silesia. Until nearly the year 1000 Silesia had no <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of its own. The right bank of the Oder belonged to the Diocese of Posen which was established in 968 and was suffragan of <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>; the left bank belonged to the Diocese of Prague, that was established in 973 and was suffragan of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. The Emperor <a href="11356a.htm">Otto III</a> transferred the part on the left bank of the Oder to the <a href="10148b.htm">Diocese of Meissen</a> in 995. In 999 Silesia was conquered by the Poles. Duke Boleslaw Chrobry (the Brave) of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> now founded the <a href="02761a.htm">Diocese of Breslau</a>; in the year 1000 this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was made suffragan of the new Archdiocese of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> that was established by <a href="11356a.htm">Otto III</a>. In 1163, at the command of the German <a href="06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick Barbarossa</a>, Silesia was given dukes of its own who belonged to the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the Piasts. With these rulers began the connection with <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and German civilization. Lower Silesia was governed by Boleslaw the Long, the companion-in-arms of the emperor. His successor was Henry the Bearded (1201-38), the husband of St. Hedwig. From about 1210 Henry began to bring German colonists into his territory and to permit them to found German villages and cities. Bishop Laurence of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> followed his example in the district under the control of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, the castellany of Ottmachau. The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> did much to aid the colonization and the Germanic tendencies, especially the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="09204a.htm">Leubus</a>. These established no less than sixty-five new German villages and materially promoted agriculture and gardening, mechanical arts, mining, and navigation of the Oder. In the reign of Henry II (1238-41), the son of St. Hedwig Silesia and its western civilization were threatened by the Tatars. Henry met them in battle at Wahlstatt near Liegnitz and there died the death of a hero; his <a href="06147a.htm">courageous</a> resistance forced the barbarians to withdraw. Consequently 9 April, 1241, is one of the great days of Silesian history.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The German colonization was vigorously carried on and towards the end of the thirteenth century Lower Silesia was mainly German, while in Upper Silesia the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a> were in the majority. Among the contemporaries of St. Hedwig (d. 1243) were the Blessed Ceslaus and <a href="07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a>, both natives of Upper Silesia. They entered the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and then became missionaries. Ceslaus labored in <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, where his order in 1226 obtained the Church of St. Adalbert; he died in 1242. Hyacinth, who among other labors also preached in Upper Silesia, died in 1257 at Cracow. A third native saint of Silesia was a relative of Hyacinth, Bronislawa, who became a <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> in 1217 and passed forty years in the practice of severe penances. Besides the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="09204a.htm">Leubus</a> the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> had <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> also at Kamenz (1248) Heinrichau (1228), Rauden (1252), Himmelwitz (1280), and Grussau (1292). The wealthiest <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> was the Abbey of Trebnitz for <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> founded by St. Hedwig who was buried there. Celebrated <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the Augustinians were the one on the Sande at <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, which was founded at Gorkau about 1146 and was transferred to Breslau about 1148, and that at Sagan, established in 1217 at Naumburg on the Bober and transferred to Sagan in 1284. There were also a large number of houses belonging to the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and orders of <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>, as the <a href="07477a.htm">Knights of St. John of Jerusalem</a>, <a href="08671a.htm">Knights of the Cross</a>, <a href="14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a>. Up to the middle of the fourteenth century forty-five <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for men and fourteen for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> had been established. The ruling <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, the Piasts, repeatedly divided their inheritance so that in the fourteenth century Silesia contained no less than eighteen principalities. This made it all the easier for the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> as Prince of Neisse and Duke of Grottkau to become the most important of the ruling princes. Silesia came under the suzerainty of the kings of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> in 1327-29. As <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> was controlled by <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> the change was more favorable for colonization than if it had fallen to <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Silesia suffered terribly during the Hussite Wars (1420-37). The <a href="07585a.htm">Hussites</a> repeatedly undertook marauding expeditions, and hardly any city except Breslau escaped the havoc they wrought. About forty cities were laid in ashes. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were burnt or <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> in other ways; the nobility grew poor; the peasants became serfs; the fields lay uncultivated; the "golden" <a href="02761a.htm">Diocese of Breslau</a> became a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> of "filth". In 1469 Silesia came under the suzerainty of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. However, as in 1526 <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, with Silesia, and <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> became at the same time possessions of the Habsburgs, from this time the province was once more regarded as a dependency of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> made rapid progress in Silesia. For the causes of this see <a href="02761a.htm">T<font size=-2>HE</font> P<font size=-2>RINCE</font>-B<font size=-2>ISHOPRIC OF</font> B<font size=-2>RESLAU</font></a>. In the same article also the course of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and that of the counter-Reformation are fully treated. A large share of the credit for the restoration and firm establishment of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> is due to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who during the years 1622-98 established in Silesia nine large colleges, each with a gymnasium, four residences, and two missions, and brought under their control all the higher <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of the country. This control endured, as Frederick the Great continued his protection of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, even after the suppression of the order, up to 1800. In the seventeenth century Silesia obtained great renown through the two Silesian <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of poetry, the chief of these poets being Martin Opitz, Friedrich von Logau, and Andreas Gryphius. In 1702 the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> was changed into the Leopoldine University (see UNIVERSITY OF BRESLAU). At the close of the three Silesian <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> (1740-2, 1744-5, 1756-63) the greater part of Silesia belonged to <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. By this change <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> lost the privileged position which it had regained in the counter-Reformation, even though Frederick the Great did not impair the possessions of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, as happened later (1810-40). In 1815 the Congress of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> enlarged Silesia by the addition of about half of Lausitz (Lusatia). During the decade of the forties the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of "German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>" developed from Silesia as the starting-point; this <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> was founded at Laurahutte in Upper Silesia by the ex-chaplain, John Ronge. Finally a brief mention should here be made of the enormous <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> development of the province in the last fifty years, especially in the mining of coal, the mining and working of metals, and the manufacture of chemicals and machines. In Upper Silesia especially manufactures have advanced with American rapidity. Ecclesiastically the entire province belongs to the Prince Bishopric of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> with the following exceptions: the commissariat of Katscher, which consists of the Archipresbyterates of Katscher, Hultschin, and Leobschutz with 44 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 130,944 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and belongs to the Archdiocese of Olmutz; the county of Glatz, which has 51 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 146,673 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and belongs to the <a href="12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a></p>

<h2 id="section2">Austrian Silesia</h2>

<p><a href="02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Silesia is that part of Silesia which remained an Austrian possession after 1763. It is a crownland with an area of 1987 square miles and a population of 727,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. Of its population 84.73 per cent are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 14 per cent are <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; 44.69 per cent are Germans; 33.31 per cent Poles; 22.05 per cent Czechs. As in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Silesia, agriculture, mining, and manufactures are in a very flourishing <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a>. The districts of Teschen and Neisse belong to the Prince Bishopric of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, those of Troppau and Jagerndorf to the Archdiocese of Olmutz.</p>
