<p>(<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>curatus</em>, from <em>cura</em>, care)</p>

<p>Literally, one who has the <a href="04572a.htm">cure</a> (care) or charge of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, in which sense it is yet used by the <a href="01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, "All Bishops and Curates". In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, also, the cognate <em>cur&eacute;</em> (Spanish, <em>cura</em>) is used to denote the chief <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>. In English-speaking countries, however, the word <em>curate</em> has gradually become the title of those <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who are assistants to the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, or <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, in the general <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> work of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> or mission to which they are sent by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> or his delegate. Technically speaking the curate is the one who exercises the <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, and his assistants are vicars and coadjutors; but in this article the word <em>curate</em> is used in its accepted English sense, viz. assistant <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, and corresponds, in a general way, to the <em>vicarius temporalis, auxiliaris presbyter, coadjutor parochi</em>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the first three centuries of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> there was but one church in each <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, located generally in the principal city, i.e. in the city where the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> resided. To this church the faithful of the city and surroundings villages went on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts to assist at Mass and receive the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. When the faithful became more numerous as the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> developed, the number of churches was increased not only in the city but also in the surrounding country, and services were performed in these churches by <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, who, however, were not permanently appointed; i.e. the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> remained the only <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, but had a certain number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to assist him in the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in his parochia, or diocese (Les&ecirc;tre, La Paroisse, Paris, 1906; Duchesne, The Origin of Christian Worship, London, 1906, 11-13). After the fourth century <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> began to be formed in the rural districts, but it was not until after the year 1000 that they were formed in episcopal cities (Lupi, De parochiis ante annum millesimum, <a href="02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, 1788; <a href="15354a.htm">Vering</a>, Kirchenrecht, 3d ed., 1893, p. 598). From this it will be seen that just as the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> found his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> too large for individual ministrations and care, so the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, found it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to secure the aid of other <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in attending to the spiritual needs of his people.</p>

<p>In English-speaking countries, also in a number of <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> states, at the present day, the curate holds his faculties directly from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but exercises them according to the wish and direction of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. This applies not only in the case of a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or a missionary <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> (both irremovable), but also in the case of simple <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, who by the authority of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> governs a given area styled a mission. Curates are, in general, removal at the will of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Nevertheless, this power of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> ought to be exercised with <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and charity, and in such a way that the curate shall suffer no loss of reputation, e.g. by being sent without just and reasonable cause from one mission to another, such arbitrary change being legitimately interpreted by common consent as tantamount to a punishment. In such a case, if the curate feels that he has been unfairly treated, he has (in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>) the right of appeal to the Commission of Investigation, which exists in each <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Meanwhile he must obey the order of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The form of investigation and trial is the same for curates as for rectors and <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> (<em>see</em> Wernz, op. cit. below, II, 1052). It is to be noted that the Commission of Investigation provided for the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> by a degree of <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (20 July, 1878; cf. Acta et Decr. Conc. Balt. III, 292-96) was abrogated by the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Instruction of "Cum Magnopere" of 1884, which provides in each <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> for a summary, but substantially just, process in all criminal and disciplinary causes of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> (Conc. Plen. Balt. III. Cap. III, 308-66, cf. Acta et Decreta, 287-92). This instruction obtains in <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and has lately been extended to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> for the larger <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (Taunton, p. 220).</p>

<p>The general law of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> with regard to curates is mainly concerned with their appointment and their right to proper support. By common ecclesiastical law the appointment of curates belongs to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and not the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (c. 30, X, 3, 5; Council of Trent, Sess. XXI, cap. Iv, de Ref.). But the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> can <a href="11189a.htm">oblige</a> the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> to accept a curate when the former cannot do his work, either on account of physical or <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> weakness or on account of <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; and it belongs to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and not to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, to judge whether one or more curates are <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, also to provide for their examination, <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a>, and the issuing of faculties to them. In English-speaking countries, also in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, curates are appointed by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (or <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>), who determines their salary and may remove them from one mission to another. By a particular reply of the Congregation of the Council, 14 August, 1863, it is expressly provided that this custom, derogatory to the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a>, shall be observed until the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> makes other provision.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> can assign to the curate a salary from the income of the church. If the income of the church is not sufficient the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is not to suffer; but according to the common opinion, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as far as he can, must provide from other sources for the curate. By <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> the <a href="14301a.htm">stole</a> fees (q.v.) belong to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, therefore the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot make them part of the salary of the curate. Still, the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> says that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> can assign a salary from the fruits of the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>, or otherwise provide; hence it seems to some that he might use the <a href="14301a.htm">stole</a> fees as part of the salary of the curate. The custom of each <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is a sure guide on this point; in any case, there is always the opportunity of appeal to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in a case of more than ordinary difficulty. The authority of the curate is gathered from his letter of appointment, the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>, and legitimate custom. Its actual limitations may also be gathered from the manuals of canon law most used in the various <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries. As a general rule, curates are not moved without good reason from the churches which they serve; such a reason should be the promotion of the curate, the good of a particular <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, or the general good of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. This latter is fairly comprehensive and gives the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> a wide discretion. Bishops are advised to act as far as possible, in a manner agreeable to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of Westminster provide that in each mission one <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is appointed to be the first (primus), with the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of attending to the <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> and the administration of the church or congregation. Alms given for Masses are the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of each individual <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. Stole fees are not always dealt with in the same was in each mission. It is recommended that a course be followed which is most conducive to lightening the burdens of the mission. Curates ought to inform the head <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> as often as they are absent from the presbytery, even for a day; they should not be absent for a <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> or a Holy Day of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> without the leave of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, except in case of urgency, in which case the curate, on leaving home, ought as soon as possible to inform the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of said urgency, and should leave a suitable <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> to supply his place. Curates must not consider that they are freed from work merely because they are not charged with the administration of a mission. It is their <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, under the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, to help him by preaching, by hearing <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a>, by teaching children the <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a>, by visiting the sick and administering to them the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and by fulfilling all the other <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of a missionary. Rarely should curates take meals elsewhere than in the presbytery at a common table; much less should this become habitual. In <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of Maynooth forbid any curate to incur a <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> of over &#163;20; should he do so, he is liable to censure. If disputes arise between the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and the curate, the matter is to be referred to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and in the meantime the curate is to abide by the decision of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. Every week the curate is to meet the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in order to receive from him instructions as to the arrangements for the coming week (it is to be noted that in some parts of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the curate resides apart from the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>). Absence from the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, even for one night is to be notified to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>; absence for three days is to be notified to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Absence for five days requires the written permission of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as does also absence on Sunday or a Holy Day of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Certain other <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> are incorporated in the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of Maynooth which apply equally to curates and <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. Thus, no <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> is to be declared <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> unless the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has given his written authority for such proceedings. Priests are on no account to make personal remarks about their parishioners in church. All <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> moneys received are to be entered in a book which is kept by the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. Sick <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, before they receive the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, are to hand over to the vicar forane or other responsible <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="12588a.htm">pyx</a>, holy oil vessel, registers, and all other things which pertain to the church; should the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> die, his colleagues are to take the utmost care that all papers, letters, etc. are locked up and so safeguarded from the danger of falling into the hands of unauthorized <a href="08748a.htm">lay people</a>.</p>

<p>The Second Council of Quebec deals in detail with the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> status (<a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>) of curates in <a href="12598a.htm">French Canada</a> (<em>see</em> Discipline du Diocese de Qu&eacute;bec, Quebec, 1895, pp. 211, 252, and Gignac, Compend. Jur. Eccl. As usum Cleri Canad., ibid., 1901, De personis, 398 sqq.). In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> also, and in other English-speaking countries, the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of various <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and the legislation of some <a href="12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> (e.g. Fifth New York, 1886) regulate similar detail the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of a curate, e.g. the continuous <a href="12785b.htm">residence</a> that his office calls for and other statutory <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a>. Apropos of the relations between <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and their curates, many modern <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and <a href="12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> repeat with insistence the immemorial principles that govern the exercise of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority in all that pertains to the <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> (cura animarum), viz.: on the part of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, paternal benevolence and mildness of direction, due recognition of the <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> character of his assistants, equitable distribution of the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> and burdens, good example in religious <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and works, wise counsel of the young and inexperienced, practical guidance in all that pertains to the spiritual and even the temporal welfare of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>; on the part of the curate, willing obedience to his superior, due consultation in all matters of importance, filial co-operation, respect for the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> office and <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> reputation, a peaceful and even patient attitude when the curate seems wronged, and recourse to the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authority only when charity has exhausted her suggestions (Synod of M&uuml;nster, 1897, 147 sqq., in Laurentius, op. cit. below, pp. 170-71). Similar advice and suggestions are found in many modern writings on the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (e.g. the works of <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> <a href="09604b.htm">Manning</a>, Gibbons, <a href="15311b.htm">Vaughan</a>, and those of Mach, Keating, etc.).
