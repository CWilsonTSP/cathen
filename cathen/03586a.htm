<p><em>Character</em> indicates a special effect produced by three of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, viz. Baptism, Confirmation, and <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. This special effect is called the sacramental character. The term implies a relation (as will be explained below) to a term used in the Epistle to the Hebrews (1:3) concerning the <a href="14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who is there described as the <em>Charakt&egrave;r t&ecirc;s hypost&aacute;seos auto&ucirc;,</em> or "figure [<em>figura</em>] of the Father's substance". In <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, the term character is used in another sense in treatises concerning the <a href="15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>; the phrase "hypostatic character" being employed to signify the distinctive characteristic (or what <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> call the <em>proprietas personalis)</em> of each of the Three Divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Here we are concerned only with the sense of the word in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, that is, with sacramental character.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Sacramental character means a special <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> and ineffaceable mark, or seal, or distinction, impressed upon the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> by each of the <a href="13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> of Baptism, Confirmation, and <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>; and it is by reason of this ineffaceable mark that none of these three <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> may be administered more than once to the same <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>. This is express <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> declared both in the <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (Sess. ult., Decret. Eugenii IV, &#167;5) and in the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VII, can. ix, and Sess. XXIII, cap. iv and can. iv).</p>

<blockquote><p>If any one shall say that in three <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, viz. Baptism, Confirmation, and <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, there is not a character impressed upon the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is a certain spiritual and ineffaceable mark [<em>signum</em>] whence these <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cannot be iterated, let him be <a href="01455e.htm">anathema</a> (Concil. Trid. Sess. ult., can. vii).</p></blockquote>

<p>If, indeed, there be grave <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether any one of these <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> has really been administered, or whether the manner of its administration has been valid, then it may be administered in a conditional form. But if they really have been validly administered, they cannot again, without sacrilege, be conferred upon the same <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>. The character imparted by these <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is something distinct from the grace imparted by them. In common with the other <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, they are channels of <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. But these three have the special prerogative of conferring both grace and a character. In consequence of the distinction between the sacramental grace and the sacramental character, it may even happen, in the reception of these <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, that the character is imparted and the grace withheld; the lack of proper dispositions which is sufficient to prevent the reception of the grace may not prevent the reception of the character. Thus, an adult who receives <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> without right <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and repentance but with a real intention of receiving the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, obtains the character without the grace. The sacramental character, then, is not in itself a sanctifying gift; it is of a legal and official, rather than of a moral, nature. Nevertheless, normally, the character has a connection with grace. It is only accidentally, by reason of some faulty disposition in the recipient of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, that the association between the character and the grace is broken. In the Divine intention, and in the efficacy of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the grace and the character go together; and the grace is proportioned to the special function which the character indicates. So that the character is sometimes called a sign, or mark, of grace.</p>

<p>The sacramental character, as we have said, is ineffaceable from the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. This means, not that the effacement of this spiritual mark is an absolute metaphysical impossibility, but that in the established order of <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> there is no cause which can destroy it in this life--neither <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor degradation from the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, nor apostasy. This is of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>; and it is a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinion of great probability that the character is not effaced from the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed in <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; while it is an opinion of some probability, that it is not effaced from the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the lost. Theology further tells us that character is a mark, sign, or badge by which the recipient is devoted to the work of worshipping <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> according to the ordinances of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life; and that this is the reason why a character should be impressed by the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of Baptism, Confirmation, and <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> rather than by the others. Not all of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are directly and immediately <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the work of Divine worship; e.g. the <a href="11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> only absolves from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, restoring the sinner to his former state, but not conferring on him any special privilege or faculty. Again, among the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> immediately connected with the worship of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, we may distinguish between the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> which constitutes the very act of worship (that is the Eucharist), and those <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which qualify a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> to take part, as an agent or recipient, in the worship. Now these last are Baptism, Confirmation, and <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. The Sacrament of Orders consecrates a man to the work of Divine worship as an agent, i.e. for the conferring of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> upon other <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>; <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> dedicates a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> to Divine worship by qualifying him to receive the other <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; and confirmation, which confers spiritual manhood (as distinguished from the new birth of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>), qualifies the recipient for the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of honouring <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by professing the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> before its enemies. The sacramental character is compared by <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> to a military badge, or the insignia of an <a href="10304d.htm">order of knighthood</a>. <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a> illustrates it by an argument drawn from the analogy of civil <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, in which he names three official ranks:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the royal household, or that of the chief magistrate, by whatever name he may be called;</li><li>the public service, e.g. the army;</li><li>the officers of the army.</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>By <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he says, we are enrolled in the household of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>; by confirmation, we are made soldiers of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>; by <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, we are made officers. And as these ranks have their distinctive badges in civil <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, so in the spiritual <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, or Church, the ranks are distinguished in the sight of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> by spiritual badges, marks, or sacramental characters.</p>

<p>All <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> affirm that the sacramental character is not a mere external denomination; and practically all are agreed that it is a sort of quality or state made inherent in the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. Those, such as <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, who say that it is a relation (to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>) mean that it is a relation with a real <em>fundamentum</em>, or ground and whether we say that it is a relation having a ground in the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, or a state or quality involving a relation, seems to signify quite the same thing, the difference being only in the expression. The category of quality being divided by <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> and <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> into four kinds, <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> for the most part classify the sacramental character as something akin to the genus of quality called power. <a href="14580a.htm">Theologians</a> also tell us that the character inheres not in the very substance of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> but in one of the rational faculties; but it is a question in dispute whether the faculty in which the character inheres as its subject be the will or the practical reason (the <a href="13610b.htm">Scotists</a> holding that it is the will; the <a href="14698b.htm">Thomists</a>, that it is the practical reason). The sacramental character or mark is the character or mark of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not of the Holy Spirit, and as the Redeemer has three prerogatives, as Prophet, Priest, and King, this mark is the mark of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Priest. It is a participation in His <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and an assimilation to it. Now, every created perfection is a shadow of some perfection of the Deity, and therefore assimilation to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> even in His <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> is assimilation to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. And as the Son is described in the Epistle to the Hebrews as "the Character of the Father's <a href="14322c.htm">substance</a>", hence the sacramental character has been defined as "a distinction impressed by the Eternal Character [the Son] upon the created trinity [i.e. the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> with the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the will] sealing it into a likeness <em>(secundum imaginem consignans)</em> unto the Trinity which creates and anew-creates <em>(Trinitati creanti et recreanti)."</em> For <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> distinguishes in the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a></p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the natural image and likeness of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>;</li><li>the likeness produced by <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> and <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity;</li><li>the likeness not moral, but, so to say, legal and official, produced by the sacramental character.</li></ul></div>

<p>The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the sacramental character is one of those which have been developed, and its history is traceable with sufficient clearness. It is to be observed, however, that the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> rests upon the authority of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and that the history is given as history, not for the purpose of invoking the authority of the primitive Church. Though first solemnly defined by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, it had already been officially declared in the <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>; and it was the unanimous opinion of all <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, long before the time of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, who questioned it. It was set forth with the utmost explicitness by <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in the controversies of the fifth century. He points out that all who favoured rebaptism did so because they failed to distinguish between two effects of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> that is between the sanctifying gift of grace and the Holy Spirit, on the one hand, and the gift, on the other hand, which was not in itself sanctifying but which was a mark dedicating the recipient (cf. Contra Ep. Parm., II, n. 28, with Ep. xcviii ad. Bonifac.). In this controversy the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the sacramental character was but asserting itself with greater emphasis because it was (constructively) attacked. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was but bringing out into distinctness a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> held all along. For the Fathers of the fourth century habitually speak of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> as a permanent, an everlasting, or an ineffaceable, seal; and what they say of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> may be applied to confirmation, since the two <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were usually associated. They compare the seal, or mark, of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> with the insignia of soldiers, with the mark placed by shepherds upon sheep, with <a href="03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, with the marking of the doorposts of the <a href="08193a.htm">Israelites</a> in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Such evidence as we have from the earlier ages all tends to prove that the Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries were only thinking out more explicitly what they had received from their predecessors. Thus <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> contrasts the seal (or mark) of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the mark given by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> to his believers, with the mark of the beast (Hippolyt., De Christo et Antichristo, n. 6); the writer of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians (see <a href="04012c.htm">POPE ST. CLEMENT I</a>; <a href="04039b.htm">CLEMENTINES</a>) calls it (c. 7, 8) the "seal impressed"; the "Pastor" of Hermas (lib. III, Simil., IX, cc. 6, 16, 17, 31) speaks of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> as a seal. At the end of the second century we find in the work known as "Excerpta Theodoti" (n. lxxvi), generally attributed to <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, historical evidence of the existence of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. As the coin circulating in <a href="08544a.htm">Judea</a> in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> time bore the image and superscription of C&aelig;sar, so, the writer says, does the believer obtain through <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> the name of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> as an inscription, and the Holy Spirit as an image, upon his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>; as even brute animals by a mark show their owner and by a mark are distinguished, so the <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, which has received the seal of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, bears the marks <em>(st&iacute;gmata)</em> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>In the light of this traditional teaching it is possible to see some reference to this <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> in the Apostolic writings. Thus <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says: "Now he that confirmeth us with you in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that hath anointed us, is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>: Who also hath sealed us, and given the Pledge of the Spirit in our hearts" (<a href="../bible/2co001.htm#vrs21">2 Corinthians 1:21-22</a>). Here there is a distinction made between the "unction", i.e. grace, and the "sealing", or impressing of a mark (character), and the gift of the Holy Spirit. Again he says: "In whom [<a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>] also <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> you were signed with the holy Spirit of promise" (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs13">Ephesians 1:13</a>), and "grieve not the <a href="07409a.htm">holy Spirit of God</a>: whereby you are sealed unto the day of <a href="12677d.htm">redemption</a>" (4:30). It is obvious, therefore, that this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> has been taught from the beginning, at first, indeed, without emphasis or clearness, in an obscure and only half-conscious manner, but with growing clearness; and though some <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> may have <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether it could be proved to be contained in the deposit of <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, they did not at all <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it was <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, or that it was a part of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>.</p>
