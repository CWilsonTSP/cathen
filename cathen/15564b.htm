<p>(Waterfordiensis et Lismorensis), suffragan of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a>. This <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is almost coterminous with the ancient Celtic territory of Decies; it comprises the County of Waterford (except five townlands) with a considerable portion (two baronies and part of two others) of Tipperary County, as well as a small area (12,000 acres) of County Cork. The population is 131,636, of whom 124,367 are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, ministered to by one <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and 122 <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chapter, in abeyance since the seventeenth century, was revived with modifications in the last decade. In addition to the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, there are three houses of <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, a <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and one community each of <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Augustinians, Fathers of Charity, and Congregation of the Divine Pastor. There are thirty houses of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and ten of brothers, including the <a href="03710b.htm">(Irish) Christian Brothers</a>, whose parent house is Waterford, and the <a href="08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools (de La Salle)</a>. The following orders or congregations of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> are represented: Presentation; <a href="15228b.htm">Ursuline</a>; Our Lady of Mercy; Sisters of the Poor; Good Shepherd; Sisters of Charity; Loreto; <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>; Sisters of <a href="08472c.htm">St. John of God</a>; Sisters of Le Bon Sauveur; and <a href="08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny. All communities of brothers and the majority of the <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> religious are engaged in <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> work.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It is probable that the region of Decies received its first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> message--presumably from Britain--previous to the advent of <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. The Life of St. Declan (cf. Plummer and the <a href="02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>) places the preaching of Declan in the early fifth century, before <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> had lit his Paschal fire at Slane. The <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a> of Declan's life is very confused, and first-class authority is available for the opinion that Declan's mission was subsequent to <a href="11554a.htm">Patrick's</a>. But it is quite certain that at this period there was considerable intercourse between <a href="15532a.htm">Wales</a> and the southeast coast of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Controversy ceases when we come to <a href="03384c.htm">St. Carthage</a> [alias St. Mochuda], who established himself at <a href="09283a.htm">Lismore</a> and founded a great <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> there in 630. Long before that event, Lismore had been the seat of a religious establishment, for four early <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, predecessors of <a href="03384c.htm">St. Carthage</a>, are mentioned (Colgan, "Acta Sanctorum", and "Annals of the Four Masters"). It may be, however, that the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> in question belonged not to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> but to a Scottish Lismore. Lismore gradually became the acknowledged <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> capital of the Decies. There were other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and episcopal churches within the region in Celtic times, but there does not appear to have been anything approaching to episcopal succession in these instances, if we except the case of St. Declan's Church of Ardmore. It has been contended that the ancient deaneries represent these early episcopal churches. They probably represent the chief of them, but certainly they do not represent them all. In Waterford and Lismore the ancient deaneries were: Waterford, Kilbarrymeaden, Ardmore, <a href="09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, Ardfinan, and Kilsheelan. Up to the Synod of Rathbreasil (1110) we have the names of twelve <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> or abbot-bishops who sat in the chair of Carthage at <a href="09283a.htm">Lismore</a>. Presuming succession to have been continuous during the period, there must be many others whose names are lost. Some of the recorded successors in question are catalogued as <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> in the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>, e.g. Cuanan, <a href="04514d.htm">Cronan</a>, Mocholomog etc. At the synod just named <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was more clearly defined and <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> boundaries formally aligned. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09283a.htm">Lismore</a> at the time of the Synod of Rathbreasil was Nial MacAeducan, whose episcopal staff, inscribed with his name and covered with Celtic ornament, is still preserved at <a href="09283a.htm">Lismore</a>.</p>

<p>Keating has <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> that a Diocese of Waterford, as distinct from <a href="09283a.htm">Lismore</a>, was recognized at Rathbreasil. But Waterford was recognized as an independent <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> forty-two years later, when its <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> assisted at the Synod of Kells. Unseemly disputes between Waterford and Lismore paved the way for a union of the sees on the death of the last <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Waterford, Roger Cradock, in 1362. Waterford was the smallest diocese in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, embracing an area of only twelve miles by nine; it included little more, in fact, than the city of Waterford and the adjoining cantred of the Danes. Its history is peculiar; the <a href="03712a.htm">Christianized</a> Ostmen of the city determined, towards the close of the eleventh century, to set up a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of their own, and the racial friction between them and their Celtic neighbours is reflected in their method of procedure on the occasion. Having chosen one Malchus, a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="15649c.htm">Winchester</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, to be their first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, they sent him for <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>--not to Cashel or Lismore--but to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. It was during the incumbency of Malchus (1096-1110) that the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was erected by the Ostmen citizens, on the same plan and of the same dimensions as the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> Christ Church of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. This building, dedicated to the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, was not allowed to survive long in its original plan; a practically new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was erected early in the thirteenth century, and survived till 1770. The original endowment of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> may have been meagre or precarious; at any rate there was a re-endowment by King John--probably on the completion of the second <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Then too its first dean was appointed, and a formal confirmation of its <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> and possessions made by <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Among the more noted <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> up to the time of its union with Lismore may be mentioned: David the Welshman, who was killed by O'Phelan (1207); Robert (1210-22), who commenced the century-long quarrel with Lismore which led to his <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and to his death from grief; Stephen of Fulburn (1373-86), who became Lord Justice or Chief Governor of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and established a mint for <a href="11152a.htm">coinage</a> of "a new kind of money" in his episcopal city; Roger Cradock (1350-62), between whom and the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a> there arose litigation, because of Roger's action in executing two <a href="08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> for <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> at Bunratty Castle.</p>

<p>Though the sees were formally united in 1362, they continued to have separate <a href="03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> and chapters down to the suppression. During the period from the union of the sees to the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, Lismore was regarded as the senior partner, and the title of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> documents ran "Lismore and Waterford". Of its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> we have little information beyond what we can glean from occasional references in state papers. The majority of them bear English names; in fact, there is only one--Nicholas O'Hennessey--with a distinctly <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> cognomen; three--Purcell, Power, and Cantwell--are Norman-Irish. Nicholas Comin, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the suppression period, had an unusually long reign if, as Brady states, he resigned only in 1551, for he was translated from <a href="06045a.htm">Ferns</a> to Waterford as early as 1519, and the latter year was the tenth from his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The history of this Bishop Comin is not all clear. He appears to have been an Englishman; he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in St. Paul's, London. His name does not appear in the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> nominating his successor; instead we have the name of his predecessor, Thomas Purcell, who resigned in 1519. It was probably during Comin's episcopate that the famous vestments of <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a> work, still preserved in Waterford <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, were presented to that church by the king. These consist of four copes, two <a href="04608a.htm">dalmatics</a>, and one <a href="03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, with <a href="14301a.htm">stoles</a> and <a href="09601b.htm">maniples</a> richly wrought with silver gilt ribbons twisted around silk thread on a ground of <a href="06419a.htm">Genoese</a> velvet, and are valued at thousands of pounds. Patrick Walshe (1551-79), the next <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, has been the subject of much controversy; he was certainly <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by royal mandate. On the other hand, from the fact that he was not deposed in Mary's reign and from the appearance of his name in the provision of his successor, it is evident that he was regarded as <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. We may take it that he received <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>. However he may have temporized, his <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> further appears from his consistent patronage of Dean Peter White, the greatest pedagogue of his day, and the most strenuous opponent of royal supremacy.</p>

<p>From the death of Walshe, for full half a century the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered by vicars only. Some years previously Archbishop Walsh of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, a native of Waterford, had advised the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> that one <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and at most two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> would be enough for Munster. James White, the daring ecclesiastic who reconciled the Waterford churches on the death of Elizabeth and confronted Mountjoy when the latter came to chastise the city, was named <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> upon the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death. James White was brother to <a href="15612c.htm">Father Stephen White, S.J.</a> (<em>Polyhistor</em>), and to Father Thomas White, S.J., founder of the <a href="08158a.htm">Irish College</a> of Salamanca. Twice again within the seventeenth century had the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to revert to government of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> by vicars: from 1652 to 1671 and from 1693 to 1696. From 1677 to 1693 the affairs of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> were administered directly by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a>. For the first thirty-six years of the eighteenth century there was no resident <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <em>de facto</em> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was an exile for thirty-five years, governed through vicars; he was Richard Pierce, once military or court <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in the service of King James, and, in the years of his exile, coadjutor to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13716a.htm">Sens</a>.</p>

<p>John Brenan was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1671 to 1693, and became <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> in 1677, retaining the administration of Waterford. Patrick (De Angelis) Comerford (1629-52) was an Augustinian; he sat in the Supreme Council and died in exile in <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>. Sylvester Lloyd (1739-48), a <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> (translated from <a href="08641a.htm">Killaloe</a>), has left two <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> works, one in <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> and English, and the other, in two volumes published in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, is a translation of the great Catechism of <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>. Bishop William Egan (1774-96), while yet a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Clonmel, was author of a pamphlet on the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> practice or right of nominating in certain cases to vacant <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and Renehan insinuates that Egan's criticism of the right in question led to its abandonment. Bishop Egan was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by stealth and before daylight at Taghmon, whereas his successor, Thomas Hussey (1797-1803), was accorded a military guard of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> on the occasion of his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> in old Adam and Eve's Chapel, Dublin. Hussey, who had been <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Spanish Embassy and later president of <a href="10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>, was a <em>persona grata</em> with the government and a confidant of <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> statesmen. Burke's correspondence with him is still extant, but unpublished. John Power was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 1804-17; Robert Walshe, 1817-21; Patrick Kelly (transferred from <a href="15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, U.S.A.), 1822-29; William Abraham, 1830-37; Nicholas Foran, 1837-55; Dominic O'Brien, 1855-73; John Power (the second), 1873-87; Pierse Power, 1887-89; John Egan, 1890-91; Richard Alphonsus Sheehan, cons. 31 Jan., 1892.</p>

<p>The history of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> embraces four distinct epochs: (a) the Celtic Church; (b) the Anglo-Irish Church; (c) the penal days; and (d) the modern revival. In the glory of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church during the first and third of these periods, Waterford and Lismore--especially Lismore--has had its full share. Some <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> associated with the Decies during the Celtic period are: <a href="08201c.htm">Ita</a>; Finian the <a href="09182a.htm">leper</a>, and another Finian; Molua; Aileran; Molaise; two Aedhs; several Colmans; Kieran of Tubrid; Celsus of Armagh (buried in Lismore); Christian O'Connery, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09283a.htm">Lismore</a> and <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>; etc. In the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> the churches and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> along the Blackwater and up to Lismore suffered severely, and several of their religious were <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a>. In the penal period Waterford produced a number of great <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and scholars: <a href="09336a.htm">Peter Lombard</a>; <a href="15521d.htm">Luke Wadding, O.F.M.</a>, and four other Waddings, his kinsmen, <em>scil.:</em> Ambrose, Luke, Peter, and Michael, of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; Paul Sherlock, S.J.; <a href="15612c.htm">Stephen White, S.J.</a>; Thomas Walsh, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a>; Dr. Geoffrey Keating.</p>
