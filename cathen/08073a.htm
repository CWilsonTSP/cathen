<p>(Latin <em>interdictum</em>, from <em>inter</em> and <em>dicere</em>).</p>

<p>Originally in <a href="09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, an interlocutory edict of the praetor, especially in matter affecting the right of possession; it still preserves this meaning in both Roman and canon law. In present ecelesiastical use the word denotes, in general, a prohibition. In addition to the definite meaning it has when referring to the object of this article, the term is often loosely employed in a wider and rather untechnical sense. We speak of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, a church, or a practice of devotion being interdicted, to denote a suspended <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, one who either by canon law or by the stricture of his ordinary is forbidden to exercise his <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> functions, a church building that has been secularized, or one in which Divine service is temporarily suspended, because the edifice has incurred "pollution" or lost its <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, finally, extraordinary practices of devotion are said to be interdicted. But, strictly speaking, interdict is applied only to <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> and churches affected by the penal measure or censure called "interdict", and it is exclusively in this sense of the word that the subject is treated here. After explaining its nature and effects we shall mention the interdicts in force by common canonical law.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>An interdict is a censure, or prohibition, excluding the faithful from participation in certain holy things. These holy things are all those pertaining to <a href="15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>, and are divided into three classes:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the Divine offices, in other words the Liturgy, and in general all acts performed by <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> as such, and having reference to worship</li><li>the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, excepting private administrations of those that are of necessity;</li><li>ecclesiastical burial, including all funeral services.</li></ul></div>

<p>This prohibition varies in degree, according to the different kinds of interdicts to be enumerated:</p>

<p>First, interdicts are either <em>local</em> or <em>personal</em>; the former affect territories or sacred buildings directly, and <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> indirectly; the latter directly affect <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. Canonical authors add a third kind, the <em>mixed</em> interdict, which affects directly and immediately both <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> and places; if, for instance, the interdict is issued against a town and its inhabitants, the latter are subject to it, even when they are outside of the town (arg. cap. xvi, "De sent. excomm." in VI). Local interdicts, like personal interdicts, may be <em>general</em> or <em>particular</em>. A general local interdict is one affecting a whole territory, district, town, etc., and this was the ordinary interdict of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; a particular local interdict is one affecting, for example, a particular church. A general personal interdict is one falling on a given body or group of people as a class, e.g. on a chapter, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> or people of a town, of a community; a particular personal interdict is one affecting certain <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> as such, for instance, a given <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a given cleric. Finally, the interdict is <em>total</em> if the prohibition extends to all the sacred things mentioned above; otherwise it is called <em>partial</em>. A special kind of partial interdict is that which forbids one to enter a church, <em>interdictum ab ingressu ecclesiae</em> mentioned by certain texts. Omitting the mixed interdict, which does not form a distinct class, we have therefore:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the general local interdicts;</li><li>particular local interdicts;</li><li>general personal interdicts;</li><li>particular personal interdicts;</li><li>prohibitions against entering a church. We may add</li><li>the prohibition <a href="11189a.htm">obliging</a> the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to abstain from celebrating the Divine offices, <em>cessatio a divinis</em>, a measure somewhat akin to a particular local interdict, only that it is not imposed on account of any crime on the part of those whom it affects.</li></ul></div>

<p>This short account shows us that under the same name are grouped penal measures rather different in nature, but having in common a prohibition of certain sacred things.</p>

<p>Interdict differs from <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, in that it does not cut one off from the communion of the faithful or from Christian <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, though the acts of religion forbidden in both cases are almost identical. It differs from suspension also in this respect: the latter affects the powers of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, inasmuch as they are <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, while the interdict affects the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the faithful as such, and does not directly affect <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> as such but only as members of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Of course, it follows that the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> cannot exercise their functions towards those under interdict, or in interdicted places or buildings, but their powers are not directly affected, as happens in case of suspension; their <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> remains unimpaired, which allows of a guilty individual being punished, without imperilling the validity of his acts of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. This shows that an interdict is more akin to <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> than to suspension.</p>

<p>Whereas <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is exclusively a censure, intended to lead a guilty <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> back to repentance, an interdict, like suspension, may be imposed either as a censure or as a vindictive punishment. In both cases there must have been a grave crime; if the penalty has been inflicted for an indefinite period and with a view to making the guilty one amend his <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> ways it is imposed as a censure; if, however, it is imposed for a definite time, and no reparation is demanded of the <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> at fault, it is inflicted as a punishment. Consequently the interdicts still in vogue in virtue of the Constitution <a href="01645a.htm">"Apostolicae Sedis"</a> and the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> are censures; whilst the interdict recently (1909) placed by <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on the town of <a href="01155a.htm">Adria</a> for fifteen days was a punishment. Strictly speaking, only the particular personal interdict is in all cases a perfect censure, because it alone affects definite <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, while the other interdicts do not affect the <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> except indirectly and inasmuch as they form part of a body or belong to the interdicted territory or place. That is also the reason why only particular personal interdicts, including the prohibition to enter a church suppose a personal fault. In all other cases, on the contrary, although a fault has been committed, and it is intended to punish the guilty <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> or make them amend, the interdict may affect and does affect some who are innocent, because it is not aimed directly at the individual but at a moral body, e.g. a chapter, a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, or all the inhabitants of a district or a town. If a chapter incur an interdict (Const. "Apost. Sedis", interd., n. 1) for appealing to a future general council, the canons who did not vote for the forbidden resolution are, notwithstanding, <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to observe the interdict. And the general local interdict suppressing all the Divine offices in a town will evidently fall on the innocent as well as the guilty. Such interdicts are therefore inflicted for the faults of moral bodies, of public authorities as such, of a whole population, and not for the faults of private <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Who have the power of imposing an interdict, and how does it cease? In general, the reader may be referred to <a href="03527a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL CENSURES</a>, and <a href="05678a.htm">EXCOMMUNICATION</a>. We shall add a few brief remarks.</p>

<p>Any <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> having <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> <em>in foro externo</em> can impose an interdict on his subjects or his territory. It may be provided for in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and then, like other censures, can be <em>ferendae</em> or <em>latae sententiae</em>. A particular personal interdict is removed by <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>, other interdicts are said to be "raised", but this does not imply any act relative to the <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> under interdict; when imposed as a punishment these interdicts may cease on the expiration of a definite time.</p>

<h2 id="section1">The general local interdict</h2>

<p>A general local interdict is &#151; for a whole population, town, province, or region &#151; the almost complete suspension of the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> and sacramental Christian life. Examples of it exist as early as the ninth century, under the name of <em><a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a></em> (see in particular the Council of <a href="09263a.htm">Limoges</a> of 1031). <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> gave this measure the name of <em>interdict</em> and made vigorous use of it. It will suffice to recall the interdict imposed in 1200 on the Kingdom of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, when <a href="12001a.htm">Philip II Augustus</a> repudiated Ingeburga to marry Agnes of Meran; and that on the Kingdom of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1208, to support the election of Stephen Langton to the <a href="03299b.htm">See of Canterbury</a> against John Lackland, which lasted till the submission of that king in 1213. It was a dangerous weapon, but its severity was mitigated little by little, and at the same time it was less frequently employed. The last example of a general interdict launched by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> against a whole region seems to have been that imposed by <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a> in 1606 on the territory of <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, it was raised in the following year. A quite recent example of a general, local, and personal interdict, but of a purely penal nature, is the interdict placed by <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on the town and suburbs of <a href="01155a.htm">Adria</a> in Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, by <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of the Consistory, on 30 September, 1909, to punish the population of <a href="01155a.htm">Adria</a> for a sacrilegious attack made on the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr. Boggiani, in order to prevent him from transferring his residence to Rovigo. The interdict was to last for fifteen days, and contained the following provisions: "Prohibited are: (a) the celebration of the Mass and all other <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> ceremonies; (b) the ringing of bells; (c) the public administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; (d) solemn burial. The following alone are permitted: (a) the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children, the administration of the other <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and of the <a href="15397c.htm">Viaticum</a> to the sick, (b) the private celebration of marriages; (c) one Mass each week for the renewal of the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>." It was recalled that the violation of this interdict constitutes a mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> for all and imposed an irregularity on <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> (Acta Ap. Sedis, 15 Oct., 1909, p. 765).</p>

<p>To return to the subject of a general local interdict, but non-personal in kind, the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> authorizes the private celebration of Mass and the choir office, the doors of the church being closed (c. lvii, "De sent. exc.", and c. xxiv, eod. in VI), and also the administration of confirmation; on the other hand canonical authors did not allow extreme unction for the sick, but <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> permits it. To these relaxations must be added the exceptions made in time of interdict for the celebration of the great feasts of <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, Pentecost, the Assumption, <a href="04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, and its octave.</p>

<h2 id="section2">The particular local interdict</h2>

<p>The particular local interdict has the same effects, but they are limited to the interdicted place or church. The above-mentioned mitigations, however, are not allowed. Whoever knowingly celebrates or causes to be celebrated the Divine offices in an interdicted place incurs <em>ipso facto</em> the prohibition against entering the church until he has made amends (Const. Ap. Sedis, interd., n. 2); and any cleric who knowingly celebrates any Divine office in a place interdicted by name becomes irregular (C. xviii, "De sent. excomm." in VI), but not if he administers a sacrament to an interdicted individual, as the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> has not legislated for such a case.</p>

<h2 id="section3">The general personal interdict</h2>

<p>The general personal interdict, which, we have seen, may be combined with the local interdict, has the same effects for all the <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who form or will form part of the group, community, or moral <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> under interdict: all the canons of a chapter, all the religious of a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, all the inhabitants of a town, all those domiciled in the place, etc. They, however, escape from the interdict who are not members or who cease to be members of the body affected, e.g. a canon appointed to another <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>, a stranger who leaves the town, etc. But the mere change of locality has no liberating effect, and the interdict follows the individual members of the body wherever they may go.</p>

<h2 id="section4">The particular personal interdict</h2>

<p>The particular personal interdict, which is a real censure, affects <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> much in the same way as <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. They may not assist at the Divine offices or at Mass, and if they are interdicted by name they should be put out, however, if they refuse to withdraw it is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to suspend the service since, after all, the interdict does not deprive them of the communion of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. They may not demand to receive the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, except Penance and the <a href="15397c.htm">Viaticum</a>, and it is not lawful to administer them. They are to be deprived of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> burial, but Mass and the ordinary <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> may be said for them. A cleric violating the interdict becomes irregular.</p>

<h2 id="section5">The interdict against entering the Church</h2>

<p>The interdict against entering the church is a real censure, intended to bring about the amendment of the <a href="05525a.htm">erring</a> one; it prohibits him from taking part in Divine service in the church and from being accorded a burial service in it. But outside the church he is as if he had not incurred any censure, he can attend Divine service and receive the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in a private oratory and <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> in the church when service is not being held in it.

<h2 id="section6">The cessation from divine service</h2>

<p>The cessation from Divine service, <em>cessatio a divinis</em>, follows the rules of the local interdict, from which it differs, not in its effects, but only because the fault for which it is imposed is not the fault of the <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> who are prohibited from celebrating the Divine service. It forbids the holding of Divine service and the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in a given sacred place. It is a manifestation of sorrow and a kind of reparation for a grievous wrong done to a holy place. This <em>cessatio a divinis</em> is not imposed <em>ipso facto</em> by the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>; it is imposed by the ordinary when and under the conditions that he judges suitable.</p>

<p>There are five interdicts <em>latae sententiae</em>, two of which are mentioned in the Constitution <a href="01645a.htm">"Apostolicae Sedis"</a>, two decreed by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and one added by the Constitution "Romanus Pontifex" of 23 August, 1873:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>"Universities, colleges, and chapters, whatsoever be their name, that appeal from the ordinances or mandates of the reigning <a href="12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> to a future general council, incur an interdict specially reserved to the <a href="12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>." This interdict is imposed for the same crime as the specially reserved <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> no. 4 [see <a href="05678a.htm">EXCOMMUNICATION</a>, VII, A, (a)], but the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> falls on the <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and the interdict on the group, or moral <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, by whatever name they be called, and who cannot be <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> as such.</li><li>"Those who knowingly celebrate or cause to be celebrated the Divine offices in places interdicted by the ordinary or his delegate, or by the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>; those who admit <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by name to the Divine offices, the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, or to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> burial, incur <em>pleno jure</em> the interdict against entering the church, until they have made amends sufficient in the opinion of him whose order they have contemned." This interdict, which is borrowed, except for a few minor modifications, from c. viii, "De privilegiis", in VI of <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, is therefore reserved to the competent <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>. Its object is to ensure the observance, on the one hand, of the local interdict, and, on the other, of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> by name (see <a href="05678a.htm">EXCOMMUNICATION</a>, vol. V, p. 680, subtitle <em>Vitandi and Tolerati</em>).</li><li>The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, cap. i, "De Ref.") imposes on <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of residence; it prescribes that those who absent themselves without a sufficient reason for six continuous months are to be deprived of a quarter of their annual revenue; then of another quarter for a second six months' absence; after which, the council continues, "as their <a href="04340a.htm">contumacy</a> increases . . . the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> will be bound to denounce to the <a href="12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, by letter or by messenger, within three months, his absent suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the senior resident suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> will be <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to denounce his absent <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, under penalty of interdict against entering the church, incurred <em>eo ipso</em>. The <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of denouncing begins, therefore, only after an entire year's absence, and the interdict is incurred only if the denunciation has not been made within the next three months.</li><li>The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VII, cap. x, "De Ref.") forbids chapters, during the vacancy of a see, to grant dimissory letters within a year <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the vacancy, unless to <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> who are <em>arctati</em>, i.e. <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to obtain <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> on account of a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>; this prohibition carries with it the penalty of interdict. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> having later (Sess. XXIV, cap. xvi, "De Ref.") <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> the chapter to name a <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> within eight days, the interdict can be incurred by the chapter only for dimissory letters granted during these eight days. It is disputed whether or not the <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> would incur the interdict for this fault (Pennacchi in Const. "Ap. Sedis", III. 469).</li><li>The Constitution "Romanus Pontifex" aims at preventing those who are elected by the chapters or named by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> from undertaking the administration of their church under the name or title of <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>. Besides the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> incurred by the chapters and the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected (see <a href="05678a.htm">EXCOMMUNICATION</a>, sub-title <em>Excommunications Pronounced or Renewed Since the Constitution "Apostolica Sedis"</em>), <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> imposes on "those among them who have received the episcopal order a suspension from the exercise of their pontifical powers and the interdict against entering the church, <em>pleno jure</em> and without any declaration." </li></ol></div>
