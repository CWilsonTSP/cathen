<p>(<em>See also</em> <a href="02089a.htm">WORKS OF SAINT AUGUSTINE</a> and <a href="02091a.htm">TEACHING OF SAINT AUGUSTINE</a>.)</p>

<p>The great St. Augustine's life is unfolded to us in documents of unrivaled richness, and of no great <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> of ancient times have we information comparable to that contained in the <a href="../fathers/1101.htm">"Confessions"</a>, which relate the touching story of his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, the "Retractations," which give the history of his <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>, and the "Life of Augustine," written by his friend <a href="12318a.htm">Possidius</a>, telling of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> apostolate.</p>

<p>We will confine ourselves to sketching the three periods of this great life: (1) the young wanderer's gradual return to the Faith; (2) the doctrinal development of the Christian philosopher to the time of his episcopate; and (3) the full development of his activities upon the Episcopal throne of Hippo.</p>

<h2 id="section1">From his birth to his conversion (354-386)</h2>

<p>Augustine was born at Tagaste on 13 November, 354. Tagaste, now Souk-Ahras, about 60 miles from Bona (ancient <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo-Regius</a>), was at that <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> a small free city of proconsular Numidia which had recently been <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> from <a href="05121a.htm">Donatism</a>. Although eminently respectable, his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> was not <a href="15571a.htm">rich</a>, and his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, Patricius, one of the <em>curiales</em> of the city, was still a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a>. However, the admirable <a href="15472a.htm">virtues</a> that made <a href="10482a.htm">Monica</a> the ideal of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> mothers at length brought her husband the <a href="06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and of a <a href="04660c.htm">holy death</a>, about the year 371.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Augustine received a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. His mother had him <a href="13785a.htm">signed with the cross</a> and enrolled among the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. Once, when very ill, he asked for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but, all danger being soon passed, he deferred receiving the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, thus yielding to a deplorable <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> of the times. His association with "men of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>" left three great <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> deeply engraven upon his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>: a <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, the future life with <a href="07207a.htm">terrible sanctions</a>, and, above all, <a href="08374c.htm">Christ the Saviour</a>. "From my tenderest infancy, I had in a manner sucked with my mother's milk that <a href="07421a.htm">name of my Saviour</a>, Thy Son; I kept it in the recesses of my heart; and all that presented itself to me without that <a href="07421a.htm">Divine Name</a>, though it might be elegant, well written, and even replete with <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, did not altogether carry me away" (<a href="../fathers/110101.htm"><em>Confessions</em> I.4</a>).</p>

<p>But a great <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> crisis stifled for a <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> all these <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiments. The heart was the first point of attack. Patricius, <a href="12405a.htm">proud</a> of his son's success in the schools of Tagaste and <a href="09512a.htm">Madaura</a> determined to send him to <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a> to prepare for a forensic career. But, unfortunately, it required several months to collect the necessary means, and Augustine had to spend his sixteenth year at Tagaste in an idleness which was fatal to his <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>; he gave himself up to pleasure with all the vehemence of an ardent <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>. At first he <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a>, but without the sincere desire of being heard, and when he reached <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, towards the end of the year 370, every circumstance tended to draw him from his <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> course: the many seductions of the great city that was still half <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a>, the licentiousness of other students, the theatres, the intoxication of his literary success, and a <a href="12405a.htm">proud</a> desire always to be first, even in <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>. Before long he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confess to <a href="10482a.htm">Monica</a> that he had formed a <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a> liaison with the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who bore him a son (372), "the son of his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>" &mdash; an entanglement from which he only delivered himself at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> after fifteen years of its thralldom.</p>

<p>Two extremes are to be avoided in the appreciation of this crisis. Some, like Mommsen, misled perhaps by the tone of grief in the <a href="../fathers/1101.htm">"Confessions"</a>, have exaggerated it: in the "Realencyklop&auml;die" (3d ed., II, 268) Loofs reproves Mommsen on this score, and yet he himself is too lenient towards Augustine, when he claims that in those days, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> permitted <a href="04207a.htm">concubinage</a>. The <a href="../fathers/1101.htm">"Confessions"</a> alone <a href="12454c.htm">prove</a> that Loofs did not understand the 17th <a href="03287a.htm">canon</a> of <a href="14755a.htm">Toledo</a>. However, it may be said that, even in his fall, Augustine maintained a certain dignity and felt a compunction which does him <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, and that, from the age of nineteen, he had a genuine desire to break the chain. In fact, in 373, an entirely new inclination manifested itself in his life, brought about by the reading Cicero's "Hortensius" whence he imbibed a love of the wisdom which Cicero so eloquently praises. Thenceforward Augustine looked upon rhetoric merely as a profession; his heart was in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, as well as his <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, was to pass though a terrible crisis. In this same year, 373, Augustine and his friend Honoratus fell into the snares of the <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>. It seems strange that so great a <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> should have been victimized by <a href="01777b.htm">Oriental</a> vapourings, synthesized by the <a href="11712a.htm">Persian</a> Mani (215-276) into coarse, material <a href="05169a.htm">dualism</a>, and introduced into <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> scarcely fifty years previously. Augustine himself tells us that he was enticed by the promises of a free <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> unbridled by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>; by the boasts of the <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, who claimed to have discovered contradictions in <a href="02543a.htm">Holy Writ</a>; and, above all, by the hope of finding in their <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> a <a href="13598b.htm">scientific</a> explanation of nature and its most mysterious phenomena. Augustine's inquiring <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> was enthusiastic for the <a href="13598b.htm">natural sciences</a>, and the <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> declared that nature withheld no secrets from Faustus, their <a href="05072b.htm">doctor</a>. Moreover, being tortured by the problem of the origin of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, Augustine, in default of solving it, acknowledged a conflict of two principles. And then, again, there was a very powerful charm in the <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> irresponsibility resulting from a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which denied <a href="06259a.htm">liberty</a> and attributed the commission of <a href="14004b.htm">crime</a> to a foreign principle.</p>

<p>Once won over to this <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, Augustine devoted himself to it with all the ardour of his <a href="03584b.htm">character</a>; he read all its books, adopted and defended all its opinions. His furious proselytism drew into <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> his friend <a href="01374c.htm">Alypius</a> and Romanianus, his M&aelig;cenas of Tagaste, the friend of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> who was defraying the expenses of Augustine's <a href="05295b.htm">studies</a>. It was during this <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> period that Augustine's literary faculties reached their full development, and he was still a student at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a> when he embraced <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>His studies ended, he should in due course have entered the <em>forum litigiosum</em>, but he preferred the career of letters, and <a href="12318a.htm">Possidius</a> tells us that he returned to Tagaste to "teach grammar." The young professor captivated his pupils, one of whom, <a href="01374c.htm">Alypius</a>, hardly younger than his master, loath to leave him after following him into <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, was afterwards <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> with him at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, eventually becoming <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tagaste, his native city. But <a href="10482a.htm">Monica</a> deeply deplored Augustine's <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and would not have received him into her home or at her table but for the advice of a <a href="07386a.htm">saintly</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who declared that "the son of so many tears could not perish." Soon afterwards Augustine went to <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, where he continued to teach rhetoric. His talents shone to even better advantage on this wider stage, and by an indefatigable pursuit of the <a href="01760a.htm">liberal arts</a> his <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> attained its full maturity. Having taken part in a poetic tournament, he carried off the prize, and the Proconsul Vindicianus publicly conferred upon him the <em>corona agonistica</em>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It was at this moment of literary intoxication, when he had just completed his first work on <a href="01174c.htm">&aelig;sthetics</a> (now lost) that he began to repudiate <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>. Even when Augustine was in his first fervour, the <a href="09591a.htm">teachings of Mani</a> had been far from quieting his restlessness, and although he has been accused of becoming a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, he was never initiated or numbered among the "elect," but remained an "auditor" the lowest degree in the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. He himself gives the reason for his disenchantment. First of all there was the fearful depravity of <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an philosophy</a> &mdash; "They destroy everything and build up nothing"; then, the dreadful immorality in contrast with their affectation of <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>; the feebleness of their arguments in controversy with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, to whose <a href="13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> arguments their only reply was: "The <a href="13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> have been falsified." But, worse than all, he did not find <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> among them &mdash; <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> in the modern sense of the word &mdash; that <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of nature and its laws which they had promised him. When he questioned them concerning the movements of the stars, none of them could answer him. "Wait for Faustus," they said, "he will explain everything to you." Faustus of Mileve, the celebrated <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, at last came to <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>; Augustine visited and questioned him, and discovered in his responses the vulgar rhetorician, the utter stranger to all <a href="13598b.htm">scientific</a> culture. The spell was broken, and, although Augustine did not immediately abandon the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, his <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> rejected <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> doctrines. The illusion had lasted nine years.</p>

<p>But the <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> crisis of this great <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> was only to be resolved in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, under the influence of <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>. In 383 Augustine, at the age of twenty-nine, yielded to the irresistible attraction which <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> had for him, but his <a href="10482a.htm">mother</a> suspected his departure and was so reluctant to be separated from him that he resorted to a subterfuge and embarked under cover of the night. He had only just arrived in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> when he was taken seriously ill; upon recovering he opened a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of rhetoric, but, disgusted by the tricks of his pupils, who shamelessly defrauded him of their tuition fees, he applied for a vacant professorship at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, obtained it, and was accepted by the prefect, Symmachus. Having visited <a href="01383c.htm">Bishop Ambrose</a>, the fascination of that <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> kindness induced him to become a regular attendant at his preachings.</p>

<p>However, before embracing the <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, Augustine underwent a three years' struggle during which his <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> passed through several distinct phases. At first he turned towards the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the Academics, with its <a href="11740b.htm">pessimistic</a> <a href="13516b.htm">scepticism</a>; then <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonic philosophy</a> inspired him with genuine enthusiasm. At <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> he had scarcely read certain works of <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a> and, more especially, of Plotinus, before the <a href="07465b.htm">hope</a> of finding the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> dawned upon him. Once more he began to dream that he and his friends might lead a life dedicated to the search for it, a life purged of all vulgar aspirations after <a href="07462a.htm">honours</a>, <a href="15571a.htm">wealth</a>, or pleasure, and with <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> for its rule (<a href="../fathers/110106.htm"><em>Confessions</em> VI</a>). But it was only a dream; his <a href="11534a.htm">passions</a> still enslaved him.</p>



<p><a href="10482a.htm">Monica</a>, who had joined her son at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, prevailed upon him to become <a href="02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, but his <a href="02537c.htm">affianced</a> bride was too young, and although Augustine dismissed the mother of <a href="01141e.htm">Adeodatus</a>, her place was soon filled by another. Thus did he pass through one last period of struggle and anguish. Finally, through the reading of the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> light penetrated his <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>. Soon he possessed the <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> that <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the only way to <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>. After that resistance came only from the heart. An interview with Simplicianus, the future <a href="01641a.htm">successor</a> of <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, who told Augustine the story of the <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the celebrated <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> rhetorician, Victorinus (<a href="../fathers/110108.htm"><em>Confessions</em> VIII.1</a>, <a href="../fathers/110108.htm">VIII.2</a>), prepared the way for the grand stroke of <a href="06689a.htm">grace</a> which, at the age of thirty-three, smote him to the ground in the garden at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> (September, 386). A few days later Augustine, being ill, took advantage of the autumn holidays and, resigning his professorship, went with <a href="10482a.htm">Monica</a>, <a href="01141e.htm">Adeodatus</a>, and his friends to Cassisiacum, the country estate of <a href="15352a.htm">Verecundus</a>, there to devote himself to the pursuit of <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which, for him, was now inseparable from <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2">From his conversion to his episcopate (386-395)</h2>

<p>Augustine gradually became acquainted with <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, and in his <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> the fusion of <a href="12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> with <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a> was taking place. The <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> that governed this change of thought has of late years been frequently misconstrued; it is sufficiently important to be precisely defined. The solitude of Cassisiacum realized a long-cherished dream. In his books "Against the Academics," Augustine has described the ideal serenity of this existence, enlivened only by the passion for <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. He completed the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of his young friends, now by literary readings in common, now by <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> conferences to which he sometimes invited <a href="10482a.htm">Monica</a>, and the accounts of which, compiled by a secretary, have supplied the foundation of the "Dialogues." Licentius, in his "Letters," would later on recall these delightful <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> mornings and evenings, at which Augustine was wont to evolve the most elevating discussions from the most commonplace incidents. The favourite topics at their conferences were <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> (Against the Academics), <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> (On a Happy Life), the <a href="12510a.htm">Providential</a> order of the world and the problem of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> (On Order) and finally <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../fathers/1703.htm">Soliloquies</a>, On the Immortality of the Soul).</p>

<p>Here arises the curious question propounded modern critics: Was Augustine a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> when wrote these "Dialogues" at Cassisiacum? Until now no one had <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> it; historians, relying upon the <a href="../fathers/1101.htm">"Confessions"</a>, had all <a href="02408b.htm">believed</a> that Augustine's retirement to the villa had for its twofold object the improvement of his health and his preparation for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But certain critics nowadays claim to have discovered a radical opposition between the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> "Dialogues" composed in this retirement and the state of <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> described in the <a href="../fathers/1101.htm">"Confessions"</a>. According to Harnack, in writing the <a href="../fathers/1101.htm">"Confessions"</a> Augustine must have projected upon the <a href="07280a.htm">recluse</a> of 386 the sentiments of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of 400. Others go farther and maintain that the <a href="07280a.htm">recluse</a> of the <a href="10298a.htm">Milanese</a> villa could not have been at heart a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but a <a href="12159a.htm">Platonist</a>; and that the scene in the garden was a <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> not to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but to <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the genuinely <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> phase beginning only in 390.</p>

<p>But this interpretation of the "Dialogues" cannot withstand the test of facts and texts. It is admitted that Augustine received <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 387; and who could suppose that it was for him a meaningless <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>? So too, how can it be admitted that the scene in the garden, the example of the <a href="07280a.htm">recluses</a>, the reading of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> of Victorinus, Augustine's ecstasies in reading the <a href="../bible/psa000.htm">Psalms</a> with <a href="10482a.htm">Monica</a> were all invented after the fact? Again, as it was in 388 that Augustine wrote his beautiful apology "On the Holiness of the Catholic Church," how is it conceivable that he was not yet a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> at that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>? To settle the argument, however, it is only necessary to read the "Dialogues" themselves. They are certainly a purely <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> work &mdash; a work of youth, too, not without some pretension, as Augustine ingenuously acknowledges (<a href="../fathers/110109.htm"><em>Confessions</em> IX.4</a>); nevertheless, they contain the entire history of his <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> formation. As early as 386, the first work written at Cassisiacum reveals to us the great underlying motive of his researches. The object of his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is to give authority the support of <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a>, and "for him the great authority, that which dominates all others and from which he never wished to deviate, is the authority of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>"; and if he loves the <a href="12159a.htm">Platonists</a> it is because he counts on finding among them interpretations always in harmony with his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (Against the Academics, III, c. x). To be sure such confidence was excessive, but it remains evident that in these "Dialogues" it is a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and not a <a href="12159a.htm">Platonist</a>, that speaks. He reveals to us the intimate details of his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a>, the argument that convinced him (the life and conquests of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>), his progress in the <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> at the school of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (ibid., II, ii), his delightful conferences with his friends on the Divinity of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the wonderful transformations worked in his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, even to that victory of his over the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> which his <a href="12159a.htm">Platonic</a> studies had aroused in him (On The Happy Life, I, ii), and at last the gradual calming of his <a href="11534a.htm">passions</a> and the great resolution to choose wisdom for his only spouse (Soliloquies, I, x).</p>

<p>It is now easy to appreciate at its <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> value the influence of <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a> upon the <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> of the great <a href="01181a.htm">African</a> <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor</a>. It would be impossible for anyone who has read the works of St. Augustine to deny the <a href="05543b.htm">existence</a> of this influence. However, it would be a great exaggeration of this influence to pretend that it at any time sacrificed the <a href="06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a>. The same learned critic thus wisely concludes his study: "So long, therefore, as his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> agrees with his <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrines</a>, St. Augustine is frankly <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonist</a>; as soon as a contradiction arises, he never hesitates to subordinate his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to <a href="12738a.htm">religion</a>, <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> to <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. He was, first of all, a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>; the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> questions that occupied his <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> constantly found themselves more and more relegated to the background" (op. cit., 155). But the method was a dangerous one; in thus seeking harmony between the two doctrines he thought too easily to find <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a>, or <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a> in the <a href="06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. More than once, in his "Retractations" and elsewhere, he acknowledges that he has not always shunned this danger. Thus he had <a href="07672a.htm">imagined</a> that in <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a> he discovered the entire doctrine of the <a href="09328a.htm">Word</a> and the whole <a href="../bible/joh001.htm">prologue of St. John</a>. He likewise disavowed a good number of <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonic theories</a> which had at first misled him &mdash; the <a href="04413a.htm">cosmological</a> thesis of the universal <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, which makes the world one immense animal &mdash; the <a href="12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> upon that grave question: Is there a single <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> for all or a distinct <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> for each? But on the other hand, he had always reproached the <a href="12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, as Schaff very properly remarks (Saint Augustine, New York, 1886, p. 51), with being <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, or rejecting, the fundamental points of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>: "first, the great <a href="10662a.htm">mystery</a>, the <a href="07706b.htm">Word made flesh</a>; and then <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, resting on the basis of <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>." They also ignore <a href="06689a.htm">grace</a>, he says, giving sublime precepts of <a href="10559a.htm">morality</a> without any help towards realizing them.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It was this <a href="06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> that Augustine sought in <a href="02258b.htm">Christian baptism</a>. Towards the beginning of <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>, 387, he went to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and, with <a href="01141e.htm">Adeodatus</a> and <a href="01374c.htm">Alypius</a>, took his place among the <em>competentes</em>, being <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> on <a href="05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>, or at least during Eastertide. The tradition maintaining that the <a href="14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> was sung on that occasion by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="10742a.htm">neophyte</a> alternately is groundless. Nevertheless this <a href="09128a.htm">legend</a> is certainly expressive of the joy of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> upon receiving as her son him who was to be her most illustrious <a href="05075a.htm">doctor</a>. It was at this <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> that Augustine, <a href="01374c.htm">Alypius</a>, and <a href="05653a.htm">Evodius</a> resolved to retire into solitude in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>. Augustine undoubtedly remained at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> until towards autumn, continuing his works: "On the Immortality of the Soul" and "On Music." In the autumn of 387, he was about to embark at <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, when <a href="10482a.htm">Monica</a> was summoned from this life. In all literature there are no pages of more exquisite sentiment than the story of her <a href="04660c.htm">saintly death</a> and Augustine's grief (<a href="../fathers/110109.htm"><em>Confessions</em> IX</a>). Augustine remained several months in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, chiefly engaged in refuting <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>. He sailed for <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> after the death of the tyrant Maximus (August 388) and after a short sojourn in <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, returned to his native Tagaste. Immediately upon arriving there, he wished to carry out his <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="11665b.htm">perfect life</a>, and began by selling all his <a href="15571a.htm">goods</a> and <a href="01328f.htm">giving</a> the proceeds to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>. Then he and his friends withdrew to his estate, which had already been alienated, there to lead a common life in <a href="12324a.htm">poverty</a>, <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the study of <a href="13635b.htm">sacred letters</a>. Book of the "LXXXIII Questions" is the fruit of conferences held in this retirement, in which he also wrote "De Genesi contra Manich&aelig;os," "De Magistro," and, "De Vera Religione."</p>

<p>Augustine did not think of entering the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and, through <a href="06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, he even fled from cities in which an <a href="05374b.htm">election</a> was necessary. One day, having been summoned to <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> by a friend whose <a href="14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> was at stake, he was <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> in a <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> when the people suddenly gathered about him, cheered him, and begged Valerius, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to raise him to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. In spite of his tears Augustine was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to yield to their entreaties, and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 391. The new <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> looked upon his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> as an additional reason for resuming <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> at Tagaste, and so fully did Valerius approve that he put some <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a> at Augustine's disposal, thus enabling him to establish a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> the second that he had founded. His <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> ministry of five years was admirably fruitful; Valerius had bidden him preach, in spite of the deplorable <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> which in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> reserved that ministry to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Augustine combated <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, especially <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>, and his success was prodigious. Fortunatus, one of their great <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>, whom Augustine had challenged in public conference, was so humiliated by his defeat that he fled from <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>. Augustine also abolished the abuse of holding banquets in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. He took part, 8 October, 393, in the <a href="01199a.htm">Plenary Council of Africa</a>, presided over by <a href="02108d.htm">Aurelius</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and, at the request of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to deliver a discourse which, in its completed form, afterwards became the treatise <a href="../fathers/1304.htm">"De Fide et symbolo"</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section3">As bishop of Hippo (396-430)</h2>

<p>Enfeebled by old age, Valerius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, obtained the authorization of <a href="02108d.htm">Aurelius</a>, <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, to associate Augustine with himself as coadjutor. Augustine had to resign himself to <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> at the hands of Megalius, <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Numidia. He was then forty two, and was to occupy the <a href="07360b.htm">See of Hippo</a> for thirty-four years. The new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> understood well how to combine the exercise of his pastoral <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> with the <a href="10578b.htm">austerities</a> of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and although he left his <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, his episcopal residence became a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> where he lived a community life with his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who bound themselves to observe <a href="12324a.htm">religious poverty</a>. Was it an order of <a href="04051d.htm">regular clerics</a> or of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> that he thus founded? This is a question often asked, but we feel that Augustine gave but little thought to such distinctions. Be that as it may, the episcopal house of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> became a veritable nursery which supplied the founders of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that were soon spread all over <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who occupied the neighbouring <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>. <a href="12318a.htm">Possidius</a> (Vita S. August., xxii) enumerates ten of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> friends and <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a> who were promoted to the <a href="02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>. Thus it was that Augustine earned the title of patriarch of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a>, and renovator of the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a>, life in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>.</p>

<p>But he was above all the defender of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and the shepherd of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. His <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> activities, the influence of which was destined to last as long as the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, were manifold: he preached frequently, sometimes for five days consecutively, his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> breathing a spirit of <a href="09397a.htm">charity</a> that won all hearts; he wrote <a href="09202a.htm">letters</a> which scattered broadcast through the then <a href="08673a.htm">known</a> world his solutions of the problems of that day; he impressed his spirit upon divers <a href="01199a.htm">African councils</a> at which he assisted, for instance, those of <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in 398, 401, 407, 419 and of <a href="10304b.htm">Mileve</a> in 416 and 418; and lastly struggled indefatigably against all <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>. To relate these struggles were endless; we shall, therefore, select only the chief controversies and indicate in each the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> attitude of the great <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="A">The Manich&aelig;an controversy and the problem of evil</h3>

<p>After Augustine became <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> which, from the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of his <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he had manifested in bringing his former co-religionists into the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, took on a more paternal form without losing its pristine ardour &mdash; "let those rage against us who <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> not at what a bitter cost <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> is attained. . . . As for me, I should show you the same forbearance that my brethren had for me when I blind, was wandering in your doctrines" (<a href="../fathers/1405.htm"><em>Contra Epistolam Fundamenti</em> 3</a>). Among the most memorable events that occurred during this controversy was the great victory won in 404 over Felix, one of the "elect" of the <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> and the great <a href="05072b.htm">doctor</a> of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. He was propagating his <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> in <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, and Augustine invited him to a public conference the issue of which would necessarily <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a> a great stir; Felix declared himself vanquished, embraced the <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and, together with Augustine, subscribed the acts of the conference. In his writings Augustine successively refuted Mani (397), the famous Faustus (400), Secundinus (405), and (about 415) the <a href="05791a.htm">fatalistic</a> <a href="12429b.htm">Priscillianists</a> whom <a href="11322a.htm">Paulus Orosius</a> had <a href="04733b.htm">denounced</a> to him. These writings contain the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> clear, unquestionable views on the <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> problem of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, views based on an <a href="11263a.htm">optimism</a> proclaiming, like the <a href="12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, that every work of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> and that the only source of <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> is the <a href="06259a.htm">liberty</a> of creatures (<a href="../fathers/120119.htm"><em>City of God</em> XIX.13.2</a>). Augustine takes up the defence of <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>, even in <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> as he is, with such ardour that his works against the <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> are an inexhaustible storehouse of arguments in this still living controversy.</p>

<p>In vain have the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> maintained that Augustine was unconsciously a <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> and that he afterwards acknowledged the loss of <a href="06259a.htm">liberty</a> through the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="01129a.htm">Adam</a>. Modern critics, doubtless unfamiliar with Augustine's complicated system and his peculiar terminology, have gone much farther. In the "Revue d'histoire et de litt&eacute;rature religieuses" (1899, p. 447), M. Margival exhibits St. Augustine as the victim of <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysical</a> <a href="11740b.htm">pessimism</a> unconsciously imbibed from <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> doctrines. "Never," says he, "will the <a href="01777b.htm">Oriental</a> <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> and the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> have a more <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> defender than this <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>." Nothing is more opposed to the facts. Augustine acknowledges that he had not yet understood how the first <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> inclination of the <a href="15624a.htm">will</a> is a <a href="06553a.htm">gift of God</a> (Retractions, I, xxiii, n, 3); but it should be remembered that he never retracted his leading theories on <a href="06259a.htm">liberty</a>, never modified his opinion upon what constitutes its <a href="05543b.htm">essential</a> <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a>, that is to say, the full power of choosing or of deciding. Who will dare to say that in revising his own writings on so important a point he lacked either clearness of perception or sincerity?</p>

<h3 id="B">The Donatist controversy and the theory of the Church</h3>

<p>The <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist schism</a> was the last episode in the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanist</a> and <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a> controversies which had agitated the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> from the second century. While the East was discussing under varying aspects the Divine and <a href="14597a.htm">Christological</a> problem of the <a href="09328a.htm">Word</a>, the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, doubtless because of its more practical genius, took up the <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> question of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> in all its forms. The general problem was the <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; could the sinner be <a href="01061a.htm">pardoned</a>, and remain in her bosom? In <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> the question especially concerned the <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Numidia, who, in 312, had refused to accept as valid the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of C&aelig;cilian, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, by a <em>traditor</em>, had inaugurated the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> and at the same <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> proposed these grave questions: Do the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchical</a> powers depend upon the <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> worthiness of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>? How can the <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> be compatible with the unworthiness of its <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>?</p>

<p>At the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of Augustine's arrival in <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> had attained immense proportions, having become identified with political tendencies &mdash; perhaps with a national movement against Roman domination. In any event, it is easy to discover in it an undercurrent of anti-social revenge which the emperors had to combat by strict <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>. The strange <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> known as "Soldiers of Christ," and called by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> <em><a href="01223a.htm">Circumcelliones</a></em> (brigands, vagrants), resembled the revolutionary <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> in point of fanatic destructiveness &mdash; a fact that must not be lost sight of, if the severe legislation of the emperors is to be properly appreciated.</p>

<p>The history of Augustine's struggles with the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> is also that of his change of opinion on the employment of rigorous measures against the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and the <a href="01191a.htm">Church in Africa</a>, of whose <a href="01199a.htm">councils</a> he had been the very soul, followed him in the change. This change of views is solemnly attested by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> himself, especially in his Letters, <a href="../fathers/1102093.htm">93</a> (in the year 408). In the beginning, it was by conferences and a friendly controversy that he sought to re-establish unity. He inspired various conciliatory measures of the <a href="01199a.htm">African councils</a>, and sent ambassadors to the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> to invite them to re-enter the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, or at least to urge them to send deputies to a conference (403). The <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> met these advances at first with silence, then with insults, and lastly with such <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> that <a href="12318a.htm">Possidius Bishop of Calamet</a>, Augustine's friend, escaped death only by flight, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Baga&iuml;a was left covered with horrible wounds, and the <a href="09238c.htm">life</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> himself was several times attempted (<a href="../fathers/1102088.htm">Letter 88</a>, to Januarius, the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>). This madness of the <a href="01223a.htm">Circumcelliones</a> required harsh repression, and Augustine, <a href="15677a.htm">witnessing</a> the many <a href="04347a.htm">conversions</a> that resulted therefrom, thenceforth approved rigid <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>. However, this important restriction must be pointed out: that St. Augustine never wished <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be punishable by <a href="12565a.htm">death</a> &mdash; <em>Vos rogamus ne occidatis</em> (<a href="../fathers/1102100.htm">Letter 100</a>, to the Proconsul Donatus). But the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> still favoured a conference with the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatics</a>, and in 410 an edict issued by Honorius put an end to the refusal of the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. A solemn conference took place at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in June, 411, in presence of 286 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and 279 <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> spokesmen were Petilian of Constantine, Primian of Carthage, and Emeritus of C&aelig;sarea; the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> orators, <a href="02108d.htm">Aurelius</a> and Augustine. On the historic question then at issue, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> the innocence of C&aelig;cilian and his <a href="04276a.htm">consecrator</a> Felix, and in the <a href="05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> debate he established the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> thesis that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, as long as it is upon earth, can, without losing its <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>, <a href="14763a.htm">tolerate</a> <a href="14004b.htm">sinners</a> within its pale for the sake of <a href="04347a.htm">converting</a> them. In the name of the emperor the Proconsul Marcellinus <a href="13428a.htm">sanctioned</a> the victory of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on all points. Little by little <a href="05121a.htm">Donatism</a> died out, to disappear with the coming of the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandals</a>.</p>

<p>So amply and magnificently did Augustine develop his theory on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> that, according to Specht "he deserves to be named the <a href="05074a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a> as well as the <a href="05074a.htm">Doctor of Grace";</a> and <a href="10430a.htm">M&ouml;hler</a> (Dogmatik, 351) is not <a href="06021a.htm">afraid</a> to write: "For depth of feeling and power of conception nothing written on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> since <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, is comparable to the works of St. Augustine." He has corrected, perfected, and even excelled the beautiful pages of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> on the Divine institution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, its authority, its essential marks, and its mission in the economy of <a href="06689a.htm">grace</a> and the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> critics, Dorner, Bindemann, B&ouml;hringer and especially Reuter, loudly proclaim, and sometimes even exaggerate, this r&ocirc;le of the <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor</a> of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>; and while Harnack does not quite agree with them in every respect he does not hesitate to say (History of Dogma, II, c. iii): "It is one of the points upon which Augustine specially <a href="01179a.htm">affirms</a> and strengthens the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>.... He was the first [!] to transform the authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> into a <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> power, and to confer upon practical <a href="12738a.htm">religion</a> the gift of a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine of the Church</a>." He was not the first, for Dorner acknowledges (Augustinus, 88) that <a href="11262b.htm">Optatus of Mileve</a> had expressed the basis of the same <a href="05075b.htm">doctrines</a>. Augustine, however, deepened, systematized, and completed the views of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> and <a href="11262b.htm">Optatus</a>. But it is impossible here to go into detail. (<em>See</em> Specht, Die Lehre von der Kirche nach dem hl. Augustinus, Paderborn, 1892.)</p>

<h3 id="C">The Pelagian controversy and the Doctor of Grace</h3>

<p>The close of the struggle against the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> almost coincided with the beginnings of a very grave <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> dispute which not only was to demand Augustine's unremitting attention up to the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of his death, but was to become an <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> problem for individuals and for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Farther on we shall enlarge upon Augustine's system; here we need only indicate the phases of the controversy. <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, where <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and his <a href="05029a.htm">disciple</a> Celestius had sought refuge after the taking of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Alaric, was the principal centre of the first <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> disturbances; as early as 412 a <a href="01199a.htm">council held at Carthage</a> condemned <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> for their attacks upon the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Among other books directed against them by Augustine was his famous <a href="../fathers/1503.htm">"De natur&acirc; et grati&acirc;"</a>. Thanks to his activity the condemnation of these innovators, who had succeeded in deceiving a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> convened at Diospolis in Palestine, was reiterated by <a href="01199a.htm">councils</a> held later at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a> and <a href="10304b.htm">Mileve</a> and confirmed by <a href="08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> (417). A second period of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> intrigues developed at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but <a href="15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a>, whom the stratagems of Celestius had for a moment deluded, being enlightened by Augustine, pronounced the solemn condemnation of these <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> in 418. Thenceforth the combat was conducted in writing against <a href="08557b.htm">Julian of Eclanum</a>, who assumed the leadership of the party and <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked Augustine.</p>

<p>Towards 426 there entered the lists a school which afterwards acquired the name of <a href="13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a>, the first members being <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="07105b.htm">Hadrumetum</a> in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, who were followed by others from <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, led by <a href="03404a.htm">Cassian</a>, the celebrated <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Saint-Victor. Unable to admit the absolute <a href="06689a.htm">gratuitousness</a> of <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a>, they sought a middle course between Augustine and <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, and maintained that <a href="06689a.htm">grace</a> must be given to those who <a href="10202b.htm">merit</a> it and denied to others; hence goodwill has the precedence, it desires, it asks, and <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> rewards. Informed of their views by <a href="12487a.htm">Prosper of Aquitaine</a>, the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor</a> once more expounded, in <a href="../fathers/1512.htm">"De Pr&aelig;destinatione Sanctorum"</a>, how even these first desires for <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> are due to the <a href="06689a.htm">grace of God</a>, which therefore absolutely controls our <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a>.</p>

<h3 id="D">Struggles against Arianism and closing years</h3>

<p>In 426 the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, at the age of seventy-two, wishing to spare his episcopal city the turmoil of an election after his death, <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> both <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people to <a href="01097a.htm">acclaim</a> the choice of the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> Heraclius as his auxiliary and <a href="01641a.htm">successor</a>, and transferred to him the administration of externals. Augustine might then have enjoyed some rest had <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> not been agitated by the undeserved disgrace and the revolt of Count Boniface (427). The <a href="15476b.htm">Goths</a>, sent by the Empress Placidia to oppose Boniface, and the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, whom the latter summoned to his assistance, were all <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>. Maximinus, an <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, entered <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> with the imperial troops. The <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor</a> defended the <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> at a public conference (428) and in various writings. Being deeply grieved at the devastation of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, he laboured to effect a reconciliation between Count Boniface and the empress. Peace was indeed reestablished, but not with Genseric, the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandal</a> king. Boniface, vanquished, sought refuge in <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, whither many <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had already fled for protection and this well fortified city was to suffer the horrors of an eighteen months' siege. Endeavouring to control his anguish, Augustine continued to refute <a href="08557b.htm">Julian of Eclanum</a>; but early in the siege he was stricken with what he realized to be a fatal illness, and, after three months of admirable patience and fervent <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, departed from this land of exile on 28 August, 430, in the seventy-sixth year of his age.</p>
