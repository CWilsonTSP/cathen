<p>The earliest of the Alexandrian <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>; he was a native of Alexandria and flourished under the Emperors Adrian and <a href="01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a>, about 120-140. St. Epiphanius's assertion that he was a disciple of Menander at Antioch and only later moved to Alexandria is unlikely in face of the statement of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and Theodoret that he was an Alexandrian by birth. Of his life we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> nothing except that he had a son called Isidore, who followed in his footsteps. The remark in the Acts of Archelaus (lv) that Basilides was "a preacher amongst the <a href="11712a.htm">Persians</a>" is almost certainly the result of some confusion. Basilides invented <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a> for himself named Barcabbas and Barcoph, and claimed to have received verbal instructions from <a href="10066a.htm">St. Matthias the Apostle</a> and to be a disciple of Glaucias, a disciple of St. Peter.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>His system</h2>

<p>As practically nothing of Basilides' writing is extant and as we have no contemporaneous <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> witnesses, we must gather the teaching of this patriarch of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> from the following early sources: (a) <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>, "Contra Haereses", I, xxiv, written about 170; (b) <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.21</a>, <a href="../fathers/02102.htm">II.6, 8, 20</a>, <a href="../fathers/02104.htm">IV.11, 12, 25</a>, <a href="../fathers/02105.htm">V.1, etc.</a>, written between 208-210, and the so-called "Excerpta ex Theodoto" perhaps from the same hand; (c) <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus of Rome</a>, "Philosophumena", VII, written about 225; (d) Pseudo-Tertullian, "Against All Heresies", a little treatise usually attached to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> "De Praescriptionibus", but really by another hand, perhaps by <a href="15414a.htm">Victorinus of Pettau</a>, written about 240 and based upon a non-extant "Compendium" of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>; (e) Artistic remains of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> such as <a href="01058b.htm">Abrasax gems</a>, and literary remains like the Pistis Sophia, the latter part of which probably dates back to the end of the second century and, though not strictly Basilidian, yet illustrates early Alexandrian <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. Later sources are Epiphanius, "Adv. Haer.", xxiv, and Theodoret, "Haer. Fab. Comp.", I, iv. Unfortunately, the descriptions of the Basilidian system given by our chief informants, St. Iren&aelig;us and <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, are so strongly divergent that they seem to many quite irreconcilable. According to <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, Basilides was apparently a dualist and an emanationist, and according to <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> a <a href="11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> evolutionist.</p>

<p>Seen from the viewpoint of <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, Basilides taught that Nous (Mind) was the first to be born from the Unborn Father; from Nous was born Logos (Reason); from Logos, Phronesis (Prudence); from Phronesis, Sophia (Wisdom) and Dynamis (Strength) and from Phronesis and Dynamis the Virtues, Principalities, and Archangels. By these <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> hosts the highest <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> was made, by their descendants the second <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and by the descendants again of these the third, and so on till they reached the number 365. Hence the year has as many days as there are heavens. The <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, who hold the last or visible <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, brought about all things that are in the world and shared amongst themselves the earth and the nations upon it. The highest of these <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> is the one who is thought to be the <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And as he wished to make the other nations subject to that which was especially his own, the other <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> principalities withstood him to the utmost. Hence the aversion of all other peoples for this race. The Unborn and Nameless Father seeing their miserable plight, sent his First-born, Nous (and this is the one who is called Christ) to deliver those who should <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in him from the power of the <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> agencies who had built the world. And to men Christ seemed to be a man and to have performed <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>. It was not, however, Christ who suffered, but rather Simon of <a href="04591b.htm">Cyrene</a>, who was constrained to carry the cross for him, and mistakenly crucified in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> stead. Simon having received <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> form, <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> assumed Simon's and thus stood by and laughed at them. Simon was crucified and <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> returned to His Father. Through the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosis</a> (Knowledge) of Christ the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of men are saved, but their bodies perish.</p>

<p>Out of Epiphanius and Pseudo-Tertullian we can complete the description this: the highest god, i.e. the Unborn Father, bears the mystical name <a href="01058b.htm">Abrasax</a>, as origin of the 365 heavens. The <a href="01476d.htm">Angels</a> that made the world formed it out of Eternal Matter; but matter is the principle of all <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> and hence both the contempt of the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> for it and their docetic <a href="14597a.htm">Christology</a>. To undergo <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in order to confess the Crucified is useless, for it is to die for Simon of <a href="04591b.htm">Cyrene</a>, not for Christ.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Hippolytus sets forth the doctrine of Basilides as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>There was a time when nothing existed, neither matter nor form, nor accident; neither the simple nor the compound, neither the unknowable nor the invisible, neither man or <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> nor god nor any of these things, which are called by names or perceived by the mind or the senses. The Not-Being God (<em>ouk on theos</em>) whom <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> calls Thought of thought (<em>noesis tes noeseos</em>), without consciousness, without perception, without purpose, without aim, without passion, without desire, had the will to create the world. I say "had the will" only by way of speaking, because in reality he had neither will, nor <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> nor perceptions; and by the word 'world' I do not mean this actual world, which is the outcome of extension and division, but rather the Seed of the world. The seed of the world contained in itself, as a mustard seed, all things which are eventually evolved, as the roots, the branches, the leaves arise out of the seedcorn of the plant.</p></blockquote>





<p>Strange to say this World-seed or All-seed (Panspermia) is still described as Not-Being. It is a phrase of Basilides: "God is Not-Being, even He, who made the world out of what was not; Not-Being made Not-Being."</p>

<p>Basilides distinctly rejected both emanation and the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of matter. "What need is there", he said, "of emanation or why accept <em>Hyle</em> [Matter]; as if <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> had created the world as the spider spins its thread or as mortal man fashions metal or wood. <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> spoke and it was; this Moses expresses thus: 'Let there be light and there was light'." This sentence has a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> ring, but we must not forget that to Basilides <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> was Absolute Negation. He cannot find words enough to bring out the utter non-existence of God; <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not even "unspeakable" (<em>arreton</em>), He simply is Not. Hence the popular designation of Oukontiani for people who always spoke of Oukon, Not-Being. The difficulty lies in placing the actual transition from Not-Being into Being. This was probably supposed to consist in the Sperma or Seed, which in one respect was Not-Being, and in the other, the All-seed of the manifold world. The Panspermia contained in itself a threefold Filiation, <em>Hyiotes</em>: one composed of refined elements, <em>Leptomeres</em>, a second of grosser elements, <em>Pachymeres</em>, and a third needing purification, <em>Apokatharseos deomenon</em>.</p>

<p>These three Filiations ultimately reach the Not-Being God, but each reaches him in a different way. The first Filiation rose at once and flew with the swiftness of thought to the Not-Being God. The second, remaining as yet in the Panspermia, wished to imitate the first Filiation and rise upwards; but, being too gross and heavy, it failed. Whereupon the second Filiation takes to itself wings, which are the Holy Ghost, and with this aid almost reaches the Not-Being God. But when it has come near, the Holy Ghost, of different substance from the Second Filiation, can go no further, but conducts the Second Filiation near to the First Filiation and leaves. Yet he does not return empty but, as a vessel full of ointment, he retains the sweet odour of Filiation; and he becomes the "Boundary Spirit" (<em>Methorion Pneuma</em>), between the Supermundane and the Mundane where the third Filiation is still contained in the Panspermia. Now there arose out of the Panspermia the Great Archon, or Ruler; he sped upwards until he reached the <a href="06079b.htm">firmament</a>, and thinking there was nothing above and beyond, and not knowing of the Third Filiation, still contained in the Panspermia, he fancied himself Lord and Master of all things. He created to himself a Son out of the heap of Panspermia; this was the Christ and being himself amazed at the beauty of his Son, who was greater than his Father, he made him sit at his right hand; and with him he created the ethereal heavens, which reach unto the Moon. The sphere where the Great Archon rules, i.e. the higher heavens, the lower boundary of which is the plane where the moon revolves, is called the Ogdoad.</p>

<p>The same process is repeated and we have a second Archon and his Son and the sphere where they rule is the Hebdomad, beneath the Ogdoad. Lastly, the third Filiation must be raised to the Not-Being God. This took place though the Gospel. From Adam to Moses the Archon of the Ogdoad had reigned (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs14">Romans 5:14</a>); in Moses and the Prophets the Archon of the Hebdomad had reigned, or <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Now in the third period the Gospel must reign. This Gospel was first made known from the First Filiation through the Holy Ghost to the Son of the Archon of the Ogdoad; the Son told his Father, who was astounded and trembled and acknowledged his <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> in thinking himself the <a href="06608a.htm">Supreme Deity</a>. The Son of the Archon of the Ogdoad tells the Son of the Archon of the Hebdomad, and he again tells his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>. Thus both spheres, including the 365 heavens and their chief Archon, Abrasax, <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. This <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not conveyed through the Hebdomad to <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the Son of Mary, who through his life and death redeemed the third Filiation, that is: what is material must return to the Chaos, what is psychic to the Hebdomad, what is spiritual to the Not-Being God. When the third Filiation is thus redeemed, the Supreme God pours out a blissful Ignorance over all that is and that shall so remain forever. This is called "The Restoration of all things".</p>

<p>From <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> we get a few glimpses into the <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> side of the system. Nominally, <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> was made the beginning of the spiritual life; it was not, however, a free submission of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but a mere natural gift of understanding (<a href="06592a.htm">Gnosis</a>) bestowed upon the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> before its union with the body and which some possessed and others did not. But if <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> is only a natural quality of some minds, what need of a Saviour, asks Clement, and Basilides would reply that <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> is a latent force which only manifests its energy through the coming of the Saviour, as a ray of light will set naphtha on fire. Sin was not the results of the abuse of <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a> but merely the outcome of an inborn <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> principle. All suffering is punishment for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>; even when a child suffers, this is the punishment of its own <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, i.e. the latent <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> principle within; that this indwelling principle has had no opportunity to manifest itself, is immaterial. The persecutions <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> underwent had therefore as sole object the punishment of their <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. All <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> was thus vitiated by the <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a>; when hard pressed Basilides would call even Christ a <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a> man, for <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone was righteous. Viewed in another way <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> was a sort of excrescence on the rational <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, the result of an original disturbance and confusion. "Their whole system", says Clement, "is a confusion of the Panspermia (All-seed) with the Phylokrinesis (Difference-in-kind) and the return of things thus confused to their own places." St. Iren&aelig;us and <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> reproach Basilides with the immorality of his system, and <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> calls Basilides a master and teacher of debaucheries. It is likely, however, that Basilides was personally free from immorality and that this accusation was <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> neither of the master nor of some of his followers. That Basilidianism, together with the other forms of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, eventually led to gross immorality, there can be no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>. <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> and <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> have preserved for us a passage of the writings of Basilides' son and successor, which counsels the free satisfaction of sensual desires in order that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> may find peace in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And it is remarkable that <a href="08580c.htm">Justin the Martyr</a> in his first Apology (xxvi), that is, as early as 150-155, suggests to the Roman emperors that possibly the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> are guilty of those immoralities of which <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> are falsely accused. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that in this passage he mentions only Simon, Menander, and <a href="09645c.htm">Marcion</a> by name; but the passage is general in tone, and elsewhere Valentinus, Basilides, and Saturninus follow in the list.</p>

<h2>Writings</h2>

<p>Nearly all the writings of Basilides have perished, but the names of three of his works and some fragments have come down to us.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>(a) <em>A Gospel.</em> Origin in his Homily on Luke, I, states that Basilides had dared to write a Gospel according to Basilides. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> adopt this state of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>; and <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, in the Prologue of his Commentary on <a href="10057a.htm">St. Matthew</a>, again speaks of an "Evangelium Basilidis". In all likelihood this "Gospel" was compiled out of our <a href="03274a.htm">canonical</a> <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, the text being curtailed and altered to suit his <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> tenets, a diatessaron on <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> lines.</p>

<p>(b) <em>A Gospel Commentary</em> in twenty-four books. (<a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> calls it "Exegetica"; the Acta Archelai et Manetis, "Tractatus".) Fragments of this Commentary have come down to us (in Stromata, IV, 12-81, sqq.; Acta Arch., lv; probably also in <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Commentary on Romans V, i).</p>

<p>(c) <em>Hymns</em>. <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> in a note on <a href="../bible/job021.htm#vrs1">Job 21:1 sqq.</a>, speaks of "Odes" of Basilides; and the so-called <a href="10642a.htm">Muratorian Fragment</a>, containing a list of canonical and non-canonical books (170 or thereabouts) ends with the words: "etiam novu psalmorum librum marcioni conscripserunt una cum Basilide assianum catafrycum constitutorem". This sentence, notwithstanding its obscurity, supports <a href="11306b.htm">Origen's</a> statement. For a collection of Basilidian fragments see Hilgenfeld, "Ketzergeschichte des Urchrist" (Leipzig, 1884), 207, 213.</p>

<h2>School</h2>

<p>Basilides never formed a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of disciples, who modified or added to the doctrines of their leader. Isidore, his son, is the only one who elaborated his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> system, especially on the anthropological side. He wrote a work on the "Psyche Prosphyes" or Appendage-Soul; another work, called "Ethics" by Clement and "Paraenetics" by Epiphanius; and at least two books of "Commentaries on the Prophet Parchor." Basilidianism survived until the end of the fourth century as Epiphanius <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> of Basilidians living in the Nile Delta. It was however almost exclusively limited to <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, though according to Sulpicius Severus it seems to have found an entrance into <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> through a certain Mark from <a href="10176a.htm">Memphis</a>. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> states that the Priscillianists were infected with it. Of the customs of the Basilidians, we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> no more than that Basilides enjoined on his followers, like Pythagoras, a silence of five years; that they kept the anniversary of the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as a <a href="06021b.htm">feast day</a> and spent the eve of it in reading; that their master told them not to scruple eating things offered to idols; that they wore amulets with the word <a href="01058b.htm">Abrasax</a> and symbolic figures engraved on them, and, amongst other things, believed them to possess healing properties.</p>

<p>Although Basilides is mentioned by all the Fathers as one of the chiefs of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, the system of Valentinus seems to have been much more popular and wider spread, as was also <a href="09645c.htm">Marcionism</a>. Hence, though anti-Gnostic literature is abundant, we know of only one patristic work, which had for its express purpose the refutation of Basilides, and this work is no longer extant. <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.7.6-8</a>) says: "There has come down to us a most powerful refutation of Basilides by Agrippa Castor, one of the most renowned writers of that day, which shows the terrible imposture of the man." With the exception of a few phrases given by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of this Agrippa and his work. (See <a href="06592a.htm">GNOSTICISM</a>.)</p>
