<p>A <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> and <a href="14613a.htm">ascetic</a> writer of Southern Gaul, and the first to introduce the rules of <a href="10467a.htm">Eastern monasticism</a> into the West, b. probably in Provence about 360; d. about 435, probably near <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. <a href="06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> refers to him as a Scythian by birth (<em>natione Scytha</em>), but this is regarded as an <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> statement based on the fact that Cassian passed several years of his life in the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> of Scete (<em>heremus Scitii</em>) in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The son of wealthy <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, he received a good <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and while yet a youth visited the holy places in Palestine, accompanied by a friend, Germanus, some years his senior. In Bethlehem Cassian and Germanus assumed the <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the monastic life, but, as in the case of many of their contemporaries, the desire of acquiring the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> from its most eminent teachers soon drew them from their cells in Bethlehem to the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="04749a.htm">deserts</a>. Before leaving their first monastic home the friends promised to return as soon as possible, but this last clause they interpreted rather broadly, as they did not see Bethlehem again for seven years. During their absence they visited the solitaries most famous for <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and so attracted were they by the great virtues of their hosts that after obtaining an extension of their leave of absence at <a href="02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, they returned to <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where they remained several years longer. It was during this period of his life that Cassian collected the materials for his two principal works, the "Institutes" and "Conferences". From <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> the companions came to Constantinople, where Cassian became a favourite disciple of <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. The famous <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Eastern capitol elevated Cassian to the <a href="04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, and placed in his charge the treasures of his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. After the second expulsion of St. Chrysostom, Cassian was sent as an envoy to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Constantinople, for the purpose of interesting <a href="08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> in behalf of their <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It was probably in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> that Cassian was elevated to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, for it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that on his arrival in the <a href="13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> he was still a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>. From this time Germanus is no more heard of, and of Cassian himself, for the next decade or more, nothing is <a href="08673a.htm">known</a>. About 415 he was at <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> where he founded two <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, one for men, over the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Victor, a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> of the last <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> under <a href="10074c.htm">Maximian</a> (286-305), and the other for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. The remainder of his days were passed at, or very near, <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. His personal influence and his writings contributed greatly to the diffusion of monasticism in the West. Although never formally <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a>, <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> regarded him as a <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, and it is related that <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a> (1362-1370), who had been an <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of St. Victor, had the words <em>Saint Cassian</em> engraved on the silver casket that contained his head. At <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> his <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated, with an octave, 23 July, and his name is found among the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Greek Calendar.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The two principal works of Cassian deal with the cenobitic life and the principal or deadly <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>. They are entitled: <a href="../fathers/3507.htm">"De institutis coenobiorum et de octo principalium vitiorum remediis libri XII"</a> and <a href="../fathers/3508.htm">"Collationes XXIV"</a>. The former of these was written between 420 and 429. The relation between the two works is described by Cassian himself (Instit., II, 9) as follows: "These books [the Institutes] . . . are mainly taken up with what belongs to the outer man and the customs of the coenobia [i.e. Institutes of monastic life in common]; the others [the "Collationes" or Conferences] deal rather with the training of the inner man and the perfection of the heart." The first four books of the "Institutes" treat of the rules governing the monastic life, illustrated by examples from the author's personal observation in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Palestine; the eight remaining books are devoted to the eight principal obstacles to perfection encountered by <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>: <a href="06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, impurity, <a href="04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a>, dejection, <em>accidia</em> (ennui), vainglory, and <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a>. The "Conferences" contain a record of the conversations of Cassian and Germanus with the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> solitaries, the subject being the interior life. It was composed in three parts. The first instalment (Books I-X) was dedicated to Bishop Leontius of <a href="06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a> and a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> (afterwards <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>) named Helladius; the second (Books XI-XVII), to Honoratus of Arles and Eucherius of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>; the third (Books XVIII-XXIV), to the "holy brothers" Jovinian, Minervius, Leontius, and Theodore. These two works, especially the latter, were held in the highest esteem by his contemporaries and by several later founders of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. St. Benedict made use of Cassian in writing his Rule, and ordered selections from the "Conferences", which he called a mirror of monasticism (<em>speculum monasticum</em>), to be read daily in his <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> also recommended the "Conferences" to his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, with reservations, however, relative to their author's <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> on <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>. On the other hand, the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> attributed to <a href="06406a.htm">Pope Gelasius</a>, "De recipiendis et non recipiendis libris" (early sixth century), censures this work as "apocryphal", i.e. containing <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> doctrines. An abridgment of the "Conference" was made by Eucherius of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> which we still possess (P.L., L, 867 sqq.). A third work of Cassian, written at the request of the Roman Archdeacon Leo, afterwards <a href="09154b.htm">Pope Leo the Great</a>, about 430-431, was a defence of the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> against the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of Nestorius: "De Incarnatione Domini contra Nestorium" (P.L., L, 9-272). It appears to have been written hurriedly, and is, consequently, not of equal value with the other works of its author. A large part consists of <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a>, drawn from the Scriptures, of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> Divinity, and in support of the title of Mary to be regarded as the <a href="15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>; the author denounces <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> as the source of the new <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which he regards as incompatible with the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity.</p>

<p>Yet Cassian did not himself escape the suspicion of <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> teaching; he is in fact regarded as the originator of what, since the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, has been known as Semipelagianism. Views of this character attributed to him are found in his third and fifth, but especially in his thirteenth, "Conference". Preoccupied as he was with moral questions he exaggerated the r&ocirc;le of <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a> by claiming that the initial steps to <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> were in the power of each individual, unaided by grace. The teaching of Cassian on this point was a reaction against what he regarded as the exaggerations of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in his treatise "De correptione et gratia" as to the irresistible power of grace and <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Cassian saw in the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> an element of fatalism, and while endeavouring to find a <em>via media</em> between the opinions of the great <a href="02084a.htm">bishop of Hippo</a> and <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, he put forth views which were only less <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> than those of the heresiarch himself. He did not deny the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Fall; he even admitted the existence and the necessity of an interior grace, which supports the will in resisting <a href="14504a.htm">temptations</a> and attaining <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. But he maintained that after the Fall there still remained in every <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> "some seeds of goodness . . . implanted by the kindness of the Creator", which, however, must be "quickened by the assistance of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>". Without this assistance "they will not be able to attain an increase of perfection" (Coll., XIII, 12). Therefore, "we must take care not to refer all the merits of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> to the Lord in such a way as to ascribe nothing but what is perverse to <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>". We must not hold that "God made man such that he can never will or be capable of what is good, or else he has not granted him a <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>, if he has suffered him only to will or be capable of what is <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>" (<em>ibid.</em>). The three opposing views have been summed up briefly as follows: <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> regarded man in his natural state as dead, <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> as quite sound, Cassian as sick. The <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> of Cassian was to regard a purely natural act, proceeding from the exercise of <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>, as the first step to <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In the controversy which, shortly before his death, arose over his teaching, Cassian took no part. His earliest opponent, Prosper of Aquitaine, without naming him, alludes to him with great respect as a man of more than ordinary virtues. Semipelagianism was finally condemned by the Council of Orange in 529.</p>
