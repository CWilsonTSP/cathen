<p>A politico-religious <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> which arose in Tyrol in the first half of the nineteenth century. Its founder was a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, Kaspar Benedict Hagleitner of Aschau, who was the only one of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergymen</a> of Brixenthal to refuse to take the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance prescribed by <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> edict of 30 May 1809, for the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="02137c.htm">secular authorities</a> of the province of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, of which Brixenthal was then a part. His notion was that <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who took this <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> were by that act <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> jointly with <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. It was not long before <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> supporters rallied to him from among Austrian sympathizers and patriots in the Brixenthal villages of Westendorf, Brixen im Thal, Hopfgarten, Itter, and from Unter-Innthal, principally in the villages of W&ouml;rgi and Kirchbichl. There were two <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> also with Hagleitner at the head of this movement, Thomas Mair, a tanner, and Hagleitner's brother-in-law, and Sebastian Manzl, the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> magistrate of Westendorf. The latter was surnamed Manhart after his estate, the "Untermanhartsgut", and it was from him that the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> derived its name. Hagleitner himself lost his cure, and in 1811 went to <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he was appointed <a href="04570a.htm">curate</a> in Wiener-Neustadt. He kept in touch however with his partisans in Brixenthal, and on Tyrol being restored to Austrian rule, he was given once more a cure in W&ouml;rgl in November, 1814. But new intrigues again resulted in his removal the following summer. He thenceforth lived a private life in and around Innsbruck until the summer of 1818, when he was ordered by the Government to repair to <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. He was named <em>Kaplan</em> shortly after in Kalksburg near <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and died there as <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest in 1836.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> reached its full development at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1815, when for the first time Manzl and his household refused to receive the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> from the vicar of his home <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Westendorf. Thenceforth Hagleitner was looked upon by the Manharter as the only <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of that region who "had the power" to confess and to administer <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. As a rule they no longer attended public <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship, but held independent reunions of their own. They refused even to receive the Last Sacraments. Thus the Manharter first of all cut themselves off from their <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, because they considered them to have been <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. They went further and proclaimed that the majority of French and German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, as supporters of <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> in the established Church, had severed themselves from the <a href="12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>, and therefore from the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> itself. Consequently, they were now devoid of <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> powers; all of their <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions were null and void; they could neither <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> nor absolve validly. The Manharter thus believed themselves to be the only genuine <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the land, and they professed to be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> adherents of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. As strictly conservative champions of traditional custom, they protested likewise against a series of innovations which had been introduced into the Austrian Church, against the abolition of <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, the abrogation of feast-days, the abolition of the Saturday fast, and the mitigation of that prescribed for the forty days of <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>. They likewise opposed text-books recently brought into the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, which were not <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> in tone, and finally they combated the vaccination of children, as an offence against <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and for this additional reason reproached the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> with countenancing and supporting this state regulation. A spell of apocalyptic extravagance took hold of the Manharter about this period, when they united with the so-called "Michael Confraternity", or the Order of the Knights of Michael. This was a fanatical <a href="14071b.htm">secret society</a> founded in Carinthia by the visionary, Agnes Wirsinger, and by a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, Johann Holzer of Gm&uuml;nd. Its adherents awaited the impending destruction of the wicked by the <a href="06330a.htm">Archangel Gabriel</a>, at which time they, the undefiled, were to be spared and to receive the earth in heritage. The heads of the Manharter began their relations with this <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> in the autumn of 1815, and in 1817 Hagleitner secured their formal admittance into it. One phase of this <a href="14074a.htm">society's</a> apocalyptic expectations led its members to regard <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> as <a href="01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> already come upon the earth.</p>

<p>In vain did the new administrator of the <a href="13411b.htm">Archdiocese of Salzburg</a>, Count Leopold von Firmian, exert himself on his pastoral visitations during the summer of 1819 to convince the Manharter of their <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>. The latter questioned the genuineness of his episcopal character and refused to hear anyone but the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The efforts of <a href="06371b.htm">Bernhard Galura</a>, spiritual counsellor to the Government, remained equally fruitless. Even punishments inflicted by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> for the holding of secret reunions and for continued disobedience failed to accomplish any result. The Manharter persisted in their request that they be permitted to send a deputation to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain a decision from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in person, but this the Government refused to allow. The majority of the members of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> were at last brought back into the fold of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> under the distinguished <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, Augustin Gruber. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that his endeavours to correct them in the course of a pastoral tour made through Brixenthal in 1824, and his appeals to them in a pastoral letter of 25 May, 1825, bore no direct fruit; but he obtained their promise to <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in and to obey him, provided the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> himself should declare that he was their lawful <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Archbishop Gruber then secured leave from the emperor for Manzl, Mair, and Simon Laiminger, to make the journey to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with an interpreter. They started in September, 1825, were received affectionately in the <a href="13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, and, by order of the Holy Father, were given a long and exhaustive course of instruction by the <a href="03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Mauro Capellari (afterwards <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>). Finally, on 18 December, they were received in private audience by <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, who confirmed everything to them and received their submission. The three deputies returned home in January, 1826, appeared before the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and declared to him their allegiance. Two canons, sent into Brixenthal as representatives of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, received the profession of allegiance of the remaining Manharter. however, while this brought back into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> the majority of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, which disappeared entirely from Brixenthal, a certain minority in Innthal, led by a fanatical <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>, Maria Sillober of Kirchbichl, refused to submit and continued to persist in their sectarianism. These fanatics extended their opposition even to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> himself, declaring that <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, having set himself in contradiction to <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, was not a lawful <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and that the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was for the time vacant. Thus the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> endured still a few dozen years with a restricted following until at last it disappeared completely with the death of its last adherents.</p>
