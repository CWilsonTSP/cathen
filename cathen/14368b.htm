<p>(<em>syllabos</em>, "collection")</p>

<p>The name given to two series of propositions containing <a href="10415a.htm">modern religious errors</a> condemned respectively by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (1864) and <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (1907).</p>

<h2 id="section1">The syllabus of Pius IX</h2>

<h3 id="A">History</h3>

<p>The first impulse towards the drawing up of the Syllabus of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> came from the <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> in 1849. Probably on the motion of the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, Pecci (later on <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>), a petition was laid before <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to bring together under the form of a Constitution the chief <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the time and to condemn them. The preparation began in 1852. At first <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> entrusted it to Cardinal Fornari, but in 1854 the Commission which had prepared the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> on the Immaculate Conception took matters in hand. It is not known how far the preparation had advanced when <a href="06470b.htm">Gerbet</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11700b.htm">Perpignan</a>, issued, in July, 1860, a "Pastoral Instruction on various <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the present" to his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. With <a href="06470b.htm">Gerbet's</a> "Instruction" begins the second phase of the introductory history of the Syllabus. The "Instruction" had grouped the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> in eighty-five theses, and it pleased the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> so much, that he set it down as the groundwork upon which a fresh commission, under the presidency of Cardinal Caterini, was to labour. The result of their work was a specification, or cataloguing, of sixty-one <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> with the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> qualifications. In 1862 the whole was laid for examination before three hundred <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who, on the occasion of the <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of the <a href="09744a.htm">Japanese Martyrs</a>, had assembled in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They appear to have approved the list of theses in its essentials. Unfortunately, a weekly paper of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>, "Il Mediatore", hostile to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, published the wording and qualifications of the theses, and thereby gave rise to a far-reaching agitation against the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> allowed the storm to subside; he withheld the <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of these theses, but kept to his plan in what was essential.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The third phase of the introductory history of the Syllabus begins with the appointment of a new commission by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>; its most prominent member was the <a href="02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> (afterwards <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Bilio. The commission took the wording of the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> to be condemned from the official declarations of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and appended to each of the eighty theses a reference indicating its content, so as to determine the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> meaning and the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> value of the subjects treated. With that the preparation for the Syllabus, having occupied twelve years, was brought to an end. Of the twenty-eight points which Cardinal Fornari had drawn up in 1852, twenty-two retained their place in the Syllabus; of the sixty-one theses which had been laid before the episcopate for examination in 1862, thirty were selected. The <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, according to the original plan, was to have taken place simultaneously with the proclamation of the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception; in the event it was ten years later (8 December 1864) that <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> published the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Quanta Cura", and on the same day, by commission of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, the secretary of State, <a href="01583d.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a>, sent, together with an official communication, to all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> the list of theses condemned by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The title of the document was: "A Syllabus containing the most important errors of our time, which have been condemned by our Holy Father Pius IX in Allocutions, at Consistories, in Encyclicals, and other Apostolic Letters".</p>

<p>The reception of the Syllabus among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was assured through the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> and obedience which the children of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> bear towards the vicar of Christ on earth. They were, besides, prepared for its contents by the various announcements of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> during the eighteen years of his pontificate; and, as a matter of fact, no sooner had it made its appearance than it was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> received in national and provincial councils by the episcopate of the whole world. Among the enemies of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, no <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> utterance had stirred up such a commotion for many years: they saw in the Syllabus a formal rejection of modern culture, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> declaration of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> on the modern State. In <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and also in those parts of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> then subject to Victor Emmanuel, its publication was forbidden. Bismarck and other statesmen of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> declared themselves against it. And to the present day, it is a stumbling-block to all who favour the licence of <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>.</p>

<h3 id="B">Binding power</h3>

<p>The binding power of the Syllabus of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> is differently explained by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>. All are of the opinion that many of the propositions are condemned if not in the Syllabus, then certainly in other final decisions of the <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> teaching authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, for instance in the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Quanta Cura". There is no agreement, however, on the question whether each thesis condemned in the Syllabus is <a href="07790a.htm">infallibly</a> <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>, merely because it is condemned in the Syllabus. Many <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> are of the opinion that to the Syllabus as such an <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> teaching authority is to be ascribed, whether due to an ex-cathedra decision by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or to the subsequent acceptance by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Others question this. So long as <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> has not decided the question, everyone is free to follow the opinion he chooses. Even should the condemnation of many propositions not possess that unchangeableness peculiar to <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> decisions, nevertheless the binding force of the condemnation in regard to all the propositions is beyond <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>. For the Syllabus, as appears from the official communication of <a href="01583d.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a>, is a decision given by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> speaking as universal teacher and judge to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the world over. All <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, therefore, are bound to accept the Syllabus. Exteriorly they may neither in word nor in writing oppose its contents; they must also assent to it interiorly.</p>

<h3 id="C">Contents</h3>

<p>The general contents of the Syllabus are summed up in the headings of the ten paragraphs, under which, the eighty theses are grouped. They are: <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, <a href="10713a.htm">Naturalism</a>, Absolute <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> (1-7); Moderate <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> (8-14); <a href="07759a.htm">Indifferentism</a> and <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> Tolerance in Religious matters (15-18); Socialism, Communism, <a href="14071b.htm">Secret Societies</a>, Bible Societies, Liberal Clerical Associations (reference is made to three Encyclicals and two Allocutions of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, in which these tendencies are condemned), Errors regarding the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and its <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> (19-38); Errors on the State and its Relation to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (39-55); Errors on Natural and Christian Ethics (56-64); Errors on Christian Marriage (65-74); Errors on the Temporal Power of the Pope (75-76); Errors in Connection with Modern <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> (77-80). The content of any one thesis of the Syllabus is to be determined according to the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of scientific interpretation. First of all, one has to refer to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> documents connected with each thesis. For, in accordance with the peculiar character of the Syllabus, the meaning of the thesis is determined by the meaning of the document it is drawn from. Thus the often-cited eightieth thesis "The pope may and must reconcile himself with, and adapt himself to, Progress, Liberalism, and Modern Civilization", is to be explained with the help of the Allocution "Jamdudum cernimus" of 18 March, 1861. In this allocution the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> expressly distinguishes between <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> civilization, and declares that history witnesses to the fact that the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has always been the protector and patron of all genuine civilization; and he affirms that, if a system designed to de-Christianize the world be called a system of progress and civilization, he can never hold out the hand of peace to such a system. According to the words of this allocution, then, it is evident that the eightieth thesis of the Syllabus applies to <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> progress and <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> and not to honest pioneer-work seeking to open out new fields to human activity.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Moreover, should a thesis, according to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> references, be taken from a condemned book, the meaning of the thesis is to be determined according to that which it has in the condemned book. For the thesis has been condemned in this particular meaning and not in any other which might possibly be read into its wording. For instance the fifteenth thesis, "Everyone is free to adopt and profess that religion which he, guided by the light of reason, holds to be true", admits in itself of a right interpretation. For man can and must be led to the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> religion through the light of reason. However, on consulting the Apostolic Letter "Multiplices inter", <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 June, 1851, from which this thesis is taken, it will be found that not every possible meaning is rejected, but only that particular meaning which, in 1848, Vigil, a <a href="11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, attached to it in his "Defensa". Influenced by <a href="07759a.htm">Indifferentism</a> and <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, Vigil maintained that man is to trust to his own <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> only and not to a Divine reason, i.e. to the truthful and omniscient <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> Who in <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation vouches for the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of a religion. In the sense in which Vigil's book understands the fifteenth thesis, and in this sense alone does the Syllabus understand and condemn the proposition.</p>

<p>The view held by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in opposition to each thesis is contained in the contradictory proposition of each of the condemned theses. This opposition is formulated, in accordance with the rules of dialectics, by prefixing to each proposition the words: "It is not <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that . . ." The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> which corresponds, for instance, to the fourteenth thesis is as follows: "It is not <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, that 'philosophy must be treated independently of <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation.'" In itself no opposition is so sharply determined as by the contradictory: it is simply the negation of the foregoing statement. However, the practical use of this negation is not always easy, especially if a compound or dependent sentence is in question, or a theoretical <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> is concealed under the form of an historical fact. If, as for instance in thesis 42, the proposition, that in a conflict between civil and ecclesiastical laws the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State should prevail, be condemned, then it does not follow from this thesis, that, in every conceivable case of conflicting <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> the greater right is with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. If, as in thesis 45, it be denied that the entire control of the public <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> belongs exclusively to the State, then it is not maintained that their control does in no way concern the State, but only the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. If the modern claim of general separation between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> is rejected, as in thesis 55, it does not follow that separation is not permissible in any case. If it be <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> to say that matrimony by its very nature is subject to the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a> (thesis 74), it is not necessarily correct to assert that it is in no way subject to the State. While thesis 77 condemns the statement that in our time it is no longer expedient to consider the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion as the only State religion to the exclusion of all other cults, it follows merely that today also the exclusion of non-Catholic cults may prove expedient, if certain conditions be realized.</p>

<p>The importance of the Syllabus lies in its opposition to the high tide of that <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement of the nineteenth century which strove to sweep away the foundations of all human and Divine order. The Syllabus is not only the defence of the inalienable <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> against the abuse of the words freedom and culture on the part of unbridled <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, but it is also a protest, earnest and energetic, against the attempt to eliminate the influence of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on the life of nations and of <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>, on the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. In its nature, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, the Syllabus is negative and condemnatory; but it received its complement in the decisions of the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> and in the Encyclicals of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. It is precisely its fearless character that perhaps accounts for its influence on the life of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> towards the end of the nineteenth century; for it threw a sharp, clear light upon reef and rock in the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> currents of the time.</p>

<h2 id="section2">The syllabus of Pius X</h2>

<h3 id="A">History</h3>

<p>The Syllabus of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> is the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili sane exitu", issued on 3 July, 1907, condemning in sixty-five propositions the chief tenets of <a href="10415a.htm">Modernism</a>. This <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a>, later on called the Syllabus of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on account of its similarity with the Syllabus of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, is a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decision of the Holy Office, i.e. of that Roman Congregation which watches over the purity of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> concerning <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>. On 4 July, 1907, <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> ratified it and ordered its publication; and on 18 November, 1907, in a Motu Proprio he prohibited the defence of the condemned propositions under the penalty of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, reserved ordinarily to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> is supplemented by the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" of 8 September, 1907 and by the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> against Modernism prescribed on 1 September, 1910. Thus, the Syllabus of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> is the first of a series of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> pronouncements dealing with the condemnation of <a href="10415a.htm">Modernism</a>, whilst the Syllabus of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> sums up the condemnations previously passed by the same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>.</p>

<h3 id="B">Contents</h3>

<p>By far the greater number of the theses of this Syllabus are taken from the writings of Loisy, the leader of the <a href="10415a.htm">Modernists</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; only a few are from the works of other writers (e.g., thesis 6, Fogazzaro; 26, Le Roy). As a rule the quotation is not literal, for it would have been possible only in a few cases clearly to express the <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> in a short proposition. According to their contents the theses may be divided into six groups. They condemn the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="10415a.htm">Modernists</a> on <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> decisions (1-8), and on <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a> (9-19); the <a href="10415a.htm">Modernist</a> Philosophy of Religion (20-26) and <a href="10415a.htm">Modernist</a> <a href="14597a.htm">Christology</a> (27-38); the theory of the <a href="10415a.htm">Modernists</a> on the origin of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (39-51) and the evolution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> with regard to its constitution and <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (52-65). In detail the Syllabus of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> condemns the following assertions: <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> decisions are subject to the judgment of scientific scrutiny and do not demand interior assent (1-8); "excessive simplicity or <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is shown by those who believe that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is really the Author of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>" (9); <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> neither inspired (in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense of the word) the sacred writers nor guarded them from all <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>; the Gospels in particular are not books worthy of historic <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>, as their authors have consciously, though piously, falsified facts (10-19); Revelation can be nothing else than the consciousness acquired by man of his relation to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and does not close with the Apostles (20-21); "The Dogmas, which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> proposes as revealed are not <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> fallen from <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, but an interpretation of religious facts, acquired by the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> through laborious process of thought" (this twenty-second thesis, with the somewhat crude expression, "truths fallen from Heaven", is taken from Loisy's "L'Evangile et l'&Eacute;glise"); one and the same fact can be historically <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> and dogmatically <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>; <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> is based upon a number of probabilities; dogmatic definitions have only a passing practical value as norms in life (23-26); the Divinity of Christ is a <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> which the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> consciousness <a href="04674a.htm">deduced</a> from its <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="10212c.htm">Messiah</a>; the real, historical Christ is inferior to the Christ idealized by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>; <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> <a href="05525a.htm">erred</a>; His <a href="12789a.htm">resurrection</a> is no historical event; His vicarious death is a Pauline invention (27-38); the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were not instituted by Christ, but are additions made by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and their successors, who, under the pressure of events, interpreted the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of Christ (39-51); <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Christ did not think of founding a Church; the latter is a purely human <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> subject to all the changes of time; of the Primacy, Peter himself <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing; the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is an enemy of scientific progress (5-57) "Truth is as changeable as man, because it is evolved with him, in him, and by him" (58); there are no immutable <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, they have developed and must develop with the progress of the centuries (59-63); "Scientific progress demands a reform of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> dogmatic conception of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, creation revelation, the Person of the Word Incarnate, and <a href="12677d.htm">redemption</a>" (64); "The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of today is irreconcilable with genuine scientific <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, unless it be transformed into a <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> without <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, i.e. a broad and liberal <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>" (65).</p>

<h3 id="C">Binding power</h3>

<p>Many theses of the Syllabus of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, as all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> affirm, are <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, i.e. <a href="07790a.htm">infallibly</a> <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>; for their contradictory is <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, in many cases even fundamental <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> or an <a href="01755d.htm">article of faith</a> in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. With regard to the question, whether the Syllabus is in itself an <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> dogmatic decision, <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold opposite opinions. Some maintain that the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> is <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> on account of its confirmation (4 July, 1907) or sanction (18 November, 1907) by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; others defend the opinion that the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> remains nevertheless the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decision of a Roman Congregation, and is, viewed precisely as such, not absolutely immune from <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>. In this <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> dispute, therefore, liberty of opinion, which has always been safeguarded by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in undecided questions, still remains to us. Yet all <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> agree that no <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is allowed to maintain any of the condemned theses. For in the decrees of a Roman Congregation we not only have the verdict of a scientific commission, which gives its decisions only after close investigation, but also the pronouncement of a legitimate religious authority competent to bind the whole Church in questions within its competence (cf. what has been said above regarding the Syllabus of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>; under I. B.).</p>

<h3 id="D">Importance</h3>

<p>The Syllabus of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> may be taken as an introduction to the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi", which gives a more systematic exposition of the same subject. It may be, therefore, that later generations will not find it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to distinguish between the importance of the Syllabus and that of the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>. Nevertheless, the Syllabus was published at the most opportune moment. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of those countries in which <a href="10415a.htm">Modernism</a> had worked its ill effects felt relieved. By this <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> the tenets of religious evolutionism were laid before them in short theses and condemned. Up to that time the significance and the bearing of isolated <a href="10415a.htm">Modernist</a> views, appearing now here, now there, had not always been fully grasped. Now, however, everyone of good will had to recognize that the <a href="10415a.htm">Modernists</a>, under the plea of assimilation to modern <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of development, had tried to destroy the foundations of all natural and <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Moreover, to the whole <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> sounded a note of warning from the supreme <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and drew attention to the excellent principles of <a href="13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> and to the growing importance of a thorough schooling in <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> criticism and in the history of <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, which the <a href="10415a.htm">Modernists</a> had abused in the most unpardonable manner.</p>
