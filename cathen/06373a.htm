<p>DIOCESE OF GALWAY AND KILMACDUAGH (GALVIENSIS ET DUACENSIS).</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; an amalgamation of two distinct ancient sees; excepting the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Shrule (County Mayo) entirely in County Galway. Kilmacduagh, covering 137,520 acres, includes the whole Barony of Kiltartan, and part of Dunkellin and Loughrea. Galway diocese includes the barony of Galway and part of Moycullen and Clare. Its extent is less than Kilmacduagh, the united <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> covering about 250,000 acres. Kilmacduagh coincides with the ancient territory of Hy Fiachrach Aidhne. On Ptolemy's map the district was called the country of the Gangani; later it was occupied by the Firbolg; and in the sixth century by the descendants of Fiachrach, brother of Niall of the Nine Hostages and uncle of Dathi. The time of its conversion to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is uncertain. Probably it was <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> before the end of the sixth century, and it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that St. Colman was its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A near relative of King Guaire of Connaught, and a native of Kiltartan, he was born after the middle of the sixth century and <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at Arran, after which he lived for years a <a href="07280a.htm">hermit's</a> life in the Burren mountains. Drawn from his retreat by the persuasions of his friends, he founded a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Kilmacduagh (610), becoming its <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and subsequently <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the whole Hy Fiachrach territory. He died in 632, and was buried at Kilmacduagh. In the five centuries following, the <a href="01531b.htm">annalists</a> make mention of only three <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="06373a.htm">Kilmacduagh</a>. At the Synod of Kells, the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was made a suffragan of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>. Among its subsequent <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> we find men with the distinctively <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> names of O'Ruan, O'Shaughnessy, O'Murray, O'Felan, O'Brien, and O'Moloney. In the reign of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Christopher Bodkin, a time-server who earned the goodwill of Henry and of Elizabeth, and who through royal favour was promoted to the <a href="15079d.htm">See of Tuam</a>. Persecution had to be faced by his successors. One of these, Hugh De Burgo, was a prominent figure in the Confederation of Kilkenny (1642-50), and a prominent opponent of the Nuncio <a href="13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a>; when the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> ended in the triumph of Cromwell, exile was his fate, <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> or death the fate of the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and confiscation that of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> landholders. After 1653 the <a href="06373a.htm">See of Kilmacduagh</a> was ruled by vicars, but after 1720 the episcopal succession was regularly maintained. In 1750 Kilmacduagh was united with the smaller Diocese of Kilfenora, the latter situated entirely in County Clare, and corresponding in extent with the Barony of Corcomroe. This union has continued. At first the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06373a.htm">Kilmacduagh</a> was Apostolic Administrator of Kilfenora, his successor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kilfenora and Apostolic Administrator of <a href="06373a.htm">Kilmacduagh</a>, and so on alternately.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Contemporary with the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="06373a.htm">Kilmacduagh</a> was that of Annaghdown, on Lough Corrib, founded in the second half of the sixth century by <a href="02758c.htm">St. Brendan</a>. In process of time, Annaghdown became an <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> extending over the territory ruled by the O'Flahertys. In this district was the town of Galway. Placed where the waters of the Corrib mingle with the sea, it was at first but a fishing village. In the ninth century it was destroyed by the Danes; subsequently it was rebuilt and protected by a strong castle; in the twelfth century again destroyed by the King of Munster; and towards the end of that century wrested from the O'Flahertys by the powerful Anglo-Norman <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of De Burgo. Other Anglo-Norman <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> also settled there, these in process of time being called the Tribes of Galway. Loyal to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and despising the old <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>, whom they drove out, the settlers made progress, and Galway in the first half of the seventeenth century, with its guilds of merchants, its mayor, sheriff, and free burgesses, was in trade, commerce, and wealth little inferior to Dublin itself. The Diocese of Annaghdown was joined to Tuam in 1324, and Galway town became in consequence part of the latter diocese. But the Galway men, regarding the surrounding people as little better than savages, were reluctant to be associated with them, and in 1484 obtained from the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a> exemption from his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The arrangement, sanctioned by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, was to have the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicholas, at Galway, a collegiate church, governed by a warden and eight vicars; these having <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the whole town, as well as over a few <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the neighbourhood. And warden and vicars "were to be presented and solely elected by the inhabitants of the town". It was a peculiar arrangement. The warden exercised episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, appointed to <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, visited the religious institutions, but did not, of course, confer orders. The eight vicars resembled somewhat the canons of a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. In 1485 Galway obtained a new royal charter subjecting the town to a mayor, bailiffs, and corporation. In 1551 the warden and vicars were dispossessed of their church and lands, which were given to a lay warden and vicars, all <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Just a century later the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were driven from the town by the Cromwellians. Gradually they came back, and having been tolerated during the reign of Charles II and favoured under his successor, James II, had again to face <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> during the penal times. In 1731 the town contained about 5000 inhabitants. In 1747 the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> governor complained of the insolence of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and of the number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> coming there from abroad; in 1762 out of its 14,000 inhabitants all were <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> except 350.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there were frequent disputes between the warden and the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a> as to the latter's <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> in Galway. There were troubles also attending the election of the warden and vicars. Driven from the corporation, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had no legally existing free burgesses, and had been compelled to meet by stealth, and constitute a mayor and corporation, so as to have the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> electoral body. But the Galway Tribes insisted on keeping the wardenship in their own hands. When the repeal of the <a href="11611c.htm">penal laws</a> allowed a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> corporation to come into existence, in 1793, the inhabitants insisted on exercising their right to vote, and conflicts with the Tribes arose. These disputes were finally ended in 1831 by the extinction of the wardenship and the erection of Galway into an <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. In 1866 the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06373a.htm">Kilmacduagh</a> being unable to discharge his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Galway was appointed Apostolic Administrator of <a href="06373a.htm">Kilmacduagh</a> and Kilfenora, "durante beneplacito Sanct&aelig; Sedis". In 1883 the union of the three <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was made permanent by <a href="03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>. Since that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is "Bishop of Galway and Kilmacduagh and Apostolic Administrator of Kilfenora". Among those connected with the diocese several have acquired fame. St. Ceallagh, who died about 550, is still <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> in Kilchrist, St. Sourney in Ballindereen, St. Foila in Clarenbridge, St. Colga in Kilcolgan. In the ninth century lived Flan MacLonan, chief poet of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries lived John Lynch, author of "Cambrensis Eversus"; O'Flaherty, author of the "Ogygia"; Dr. Kirwan, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08640a.htm">Killala</a>; MacFirbis, the <a href="01531b.htm">annalist</a>; Dr. Fahy, whose history has become a standard work; Dr. O'Dea, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04064b.htm">Clonfert</a>, and others.</p>
