<p>Formerly the seat of an archdiocese situated in the northwestern part of the present <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. After <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> conquest of the Saxons, <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was preached in the region about the lower Elbe and the lower Weser by <a href="15628a.htm">St. Willehad</a>; in 787 Willehad was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that part of <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and Friesland about the mouth of the Weser assigned him for his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He chose as his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> the city of Bremen, which is mentioned for the first time in documents of 782, and built there a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, praised for its beauty by <a href="01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a>; it was dedicated in 789. The Diocese of Bremen, however, was erected only under St. Willehad's successor, St. Willerich (804 or 805-838). After the death of the third <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Leuderich (d. 845), by an act of synod of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (848), Bremen was united with the Archdiocese of <a href="07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, which, since its foundation, in 831, had been under <a href="01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a>, who was appointed first <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the new archdiocese (848-865). Hamburg had been destroyed by the <a href="11115b.htm">Vikings</a> in 845, and in 1072, after a second destruction of the city, the <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> was definitely transferred to Bremen, though the title was not formally transferred until 1223. Until the secularization of 1803 Hamburg had its own <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. Before it was united with Hamburg, the Diocese of Bremen had belonged to the Province of Cologne. Despite the protests of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a> against the separation of Bremen, <a href="11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a>, in 864, confirmed the new foundation, which fell heir to the task of evangelizing the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> North.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Rembert, (865-888), the successor of <a href="01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a>, summoned the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> from Corvei and became a member of the order; his companion and successor, St. Adalgar (888-909), was likewise a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>. Both performed great services in the conversion of the North to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. When the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a> renewed his claims to Bremen, <a href="06139b.htm">Pope Formosus</a>, in 892, gave the decision that the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bremen was to be independent of the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Cologne, but should take part in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of Cologne. Under St. Hoger (909-916), a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> of Corvei, and Reginward (917-918), the Hungarians laid waste the diocese and even burned the city of Bremen. The ninth <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Unni, died at Birka (936), while on a missionary journey to Scandinavia. Through the efforts of Archbishop Adaldag (937-988) Bremen received the privileges of a market town, and in 967 the same <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> obtained the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a count over the city, as well as various crown-lands from <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, thus laying the foundation for the temporal possessions of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Bremen. At the instance of Adaldag three <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were erected in <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> territory and in <a href="13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>, and made suffragans of Bremen. There was a considerable accession of territory to the archdiocese under Archbishop Unwan (1013-29). The foundation, however, of the later highly developed temporal power of Bremen was laid by Adalbert, the guardian and influential counsellor of <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>; during his long episcopate (1043-72) he brought nearly all the countships (Grafschaften) within the limits of the archdiocese under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Bremen. His dream of raising the archdiocese to the dignity of a northern <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, however, was never realized. During his episcopate the Obotrites were <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and three <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, <a href="11237b.htm">Oldenburg</a>, <a href="10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>, and Ratzeburg, were erected as suffragans of Bremen. The Northern churches, however, were separated from Bremen, and later placed under the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09433a.htm">Lund</a>, who was raised to the rank of a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> in 1103. Like Adalbert, his immediate successors took the side of the emperors against the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. At the Council of the Lateran the nominal <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the churches of Scandinavia was restored to Adalbert II (1123-48), but in reality they remained independent of Bremen. During the episcopate of Adalbert Vizelin succeeded in his task of evangelizing the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of Holstein and Mecklenburg. Hartwich I (1148-68), Count of Stade, brought the countship of Stade under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Bremen. His struggle with Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, entailed great suffering to the archdiocese; in 1155 the city of Bremen was captured and plundered, and the countship of Stade seized and held by Henry. After the fall of Henry, Archbishop Siegfried (1178-84) was the first to regain possession of the countship. Hartwich II (1184-1207) founded several <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and promoted the civilization of his people; his administration of temporal affairs, however, was unfortunate and involved the archdiocese in serious difficulties with <a href="07233a.htm">Emperor Henry VI</a>, resulting in revolt on the part of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> subjects.</p>

<p>Dissensions over the choice of an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the claims of <a href="11415b.htm">Palatine</a> Count Henry, son-in-law of Henry the Lion, to the countship of Stade, left the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Bremen in sore straits at the beginning of the thirteenth century. After lengthy struggles, Archbishop Gerhard II (1219-57) finally received the undisputed possession of the countship, by which the territorial extent of the archdiocese was substantially fixed, covering, at that time, the land between the lower Weser and the lower Elbe, including also a part of the territory to the right of the mouth of the Elbe. Repeated difficulties over the choice of an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the growth of the city of Bremen, the continual disposal of <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> privileges by <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> under stress of financial embarrassment, misrule on the part of some <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and other circumstances as well, contributed towards the decline of the power and splendour of the archdiocese which took place in the course of the fourteenth century. Among the more capable <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this period were: Johann Grant (1307-27), previously <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09433a.htm">Lund</a>, Burchard Grelle (1327-44), who held a synod in 1328 and redeemed several castles of the archdiocese, which had been given as security; Johann II Slamstorff (1406-21); Boldewin von Wenden (1435-41), who was also <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Michael in L&uuml;neburg; Gerhard III (1441-63), and others. Less fortunate was the episcopate of Heinrich von Schwarzburg (1463-96), who also became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of M&uuml;nster in 1466; the city of Bremen took advantage of the almost uninterrupted absence of the last-named <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to shake off the episcopal authority almost entirely. Several estates or castles were given in pledge or fell in ruins, and the dissatisfaction of the people under the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rule increased, preparing the soil for the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The successor of Heinrich von Schwarzburg, Johann III Rohde (1497-1511), cleared the archdiocese of <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>, and introduced many reforms. In spite of the fact that he came of the middle class, he sought to increase his prestige in the diocese by taking as coadjutor Prince Christopher of Brunswick (1500). The latter succeeded in 1511, but being at the same time <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verden, resided chiefly in Verden, and so was unable to devote the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> attention to his Diocese of Bremen. The <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> won its first victory in the city of Bremen; the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> who opposed the new teaching were expelled, <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> suppressed, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter banished from the city in 1533, and allowed to return only under the condition that no Mass be said or choir service held. From the city as a centre the new teaching spread through the surrounding territory and though the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> himself and some <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for a long time offered vigorous opposition, by the help of the Smalkaldic League, which Bremen had joined, the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was introduced throughout the archdiocese, in some cases by force. After the death of Christopher (1558), the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, which was almost entirely <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> by this time, chose as his successor his brother George (1558-66), who was already <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Verden and Minden; during his episcopate, the archdiocese, with the exception of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and some country <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, accepted the teaching of <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. George was succeeded by four <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, the last (1634) being Frederick, Prince of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, later King of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> under the name of Frederick III. During the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, by the edict of restitution of Emperor Ferdinand II (1625), the archdiocese was restored to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship re-established, <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> given back to the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, and a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at Stade placed in charge of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1629-32). When, however, in 1632, the imperial troops were forced to evacuate the territory before the Swedes, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> was once more rooted out. In 1644 the archdiocese was captured by the Swedes, and in 1648 secularized by the Peace of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, and ceded as a duchy to <a href="14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, and the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter at Bremen suppressed. In 1712 the territory became a possession of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and in 1715 was purchased by the electoral Prince George of <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a>. The city of Bremen with the surrounding territory was in 1731 recognized as a free city of the empire, and in 1803 received an increase of territory; in 1815 it entered the German Confederation, in 1866 the North German Confederation, and in 1871 the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The greater part of the present duchy was ceded to <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> with the Kingdom of <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a> (1866). Ecclesiastically, the territory of the former Archdiocese of Bremen is divided among several <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: the city of Bremen and the vicinity, with about 13,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is subject to the Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern Missions, the remaining territory to the Dioceses of <a href="07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, <a href="11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, and M&uuml;nster.</p>
