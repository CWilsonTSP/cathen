<p>An ancient French province, from which five "departments" were formed in 1790: Seine-Inf&eacute;rieure (<a href="13208b.htm">Archdiocese of Rouen</a>), Eure (<a href="05671a.htm">Diocese of Evreux</a>), Calvados (<a href="02358b.htm">Diocese of Bayeux</a>), Orne (<a href="13681d.htm">Diocese of S&eacute;ez</a>), Manche (<a href="04455b.htm">Diocese of Coutances</a>). The Normans, originally <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> or <a href="11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> pirates, who from the ninth to the tenth century made numerous incursions into <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, gave their name to this province. In the Gallo-Roman period Normandy formed the so-called second Lyonnaise province (<em>Secunda Lugdunensis</em>). At Thorigny within the territory of this province was found an inscription very important for the history of the worship of the emperors in <a href="06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and of the provincial assemblies; the latter, thus meeting for this worship, kept up a certain autonomy throughout the conquered territory of Gaul. Under the Merovingians the Kingdom of Neustria annexed Normandy. About 843 Sydroc and his bands of pillagers opened the period of <a href="11115b.htm">Northman</a> invasions. The policy of Charles the Bald in giving money or lands to some of the <a href="11115b.htm">Northmen</a> for defending his land against other bands was unfortunate, as these adventurers readily broke their <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>. In the course of their invasions they slew (858) the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02358b.htm">Bayeux</a> and (859) the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>. The conversion (862) of the <a href="11115b.htm">Northman</a>, Weland, marked a new policy on the part of the Carlovingians; instead of regarding the invaders as intruders it was admitted that they might become <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Unlike the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, then disturbing <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the <a href="11115b.htm">Northmen</a> were admitted to a place and a r&ocirc;le in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The good fortune of the <a href="11115b.htm">Northmen</a> began with Rollo in Normandy itself. It was long believed that Rollo came by sea into the valley of the Seine in 876, but the date is rather 886. He destroyed Bayeux, pillaged Lisieux, besieged <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and reached Lorraine, finally establishing himself at <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, where a truce was concluded. His installation was considered so definitive that in the beginning of the tenth century Witto, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, consulted the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a> as to the means of converting the <a href="11115b.htm">Northmen</a>. Rollo's settlement in Normandy was ratified by the treaty of St. Clair-sur-Epte (911), properly speaking only a verbal agreement between Rollo and Charles the Simple. As Duke of Normandy Rollo remained faithful to the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> dynasty in its struggles with the ancestors of the future Capetians. These cordial relations between the ducal <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Normandy and French royalty provoked under Rollo's successor William Long-sword (931-42) a revolt of the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="11115b.htm">Northmen</a> settled in Cotentin and Bessin. One of their lords (<em>jarls</em>), Riulf by name was the leader of the movement. The rebels reproached the duke with being no longer a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> Scandinavian and "treating the French as his kinsmen". Triumphant for a time, they were finally muted and the aristocratic spirit of the <em>jarls</em> had to bow before the monarchical principles which William Long-sword infused into his government.</p>

<p>Another attempt at a revival of <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> was made under <a href="13041b.htm">Richard I</a> <em>Sans Peur</em> (the Fearless, 942-96). He was only two years old at his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> death. A year later (943) the Scandinavian Setric, landing in Normandy with a band of pirates, induced a number of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="11115b.htm">Northmen</a> to <a href="01624b.htm">apostatize</a>; among them, one Turmod who sought to make a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> of the young duke. Hugh the Great, Duke of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and Louis IV, King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, defeated these invaders and after their victory both sought to set up their own power in Normandy to the detriment of the young Richard whom Louis IV held in semi-captivity at Laon. The landing in Normandy of the King of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="07141b.htm">Harold Bluetooth</a>, and the defeat of Louis IV, held <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for a time (945), constrained the latter to sign the treaty of Gerberoy, by which the young Duke Richard was reestablished in his possessions and became, according to the chronicler Dudon de Saint-Quentin, a sort of King of Normandy. The attacks later directed against Richard by the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> King Lothaire and Thibaut Tricheur, Count of <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, brought a fresh descent on <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> of the soldiers of <a href="07141b.htm">Harold Bluetooth</a>. Ascending the Seine these Danes so devastated the country of <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a> that when they withdrew, according to the chronicler Guillaume of Jumi&egrave;ges, there was not heard even the bark of a dog. When Eudes of <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, brother-in-law of Richard II the Good, again threatened Normandy (996-1020) it was once more the Scandinavian chieftains, Olaf of <a href="11117b.htm">Norway</a> and Locman, who came to the duke's aid. So attached were these Scandinavians to <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> that their leader Olaf, having been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, was slain by them. Although they had become <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, all traces of Scandinavian <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> did not disappear under the first dukes of Normandy. Rollo walked barefoot before the <a href="12762a.htm">reliquary</a> of St. Oueu, but he caused many relies to be sold in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and on his death-bed, according to Adh&eacute;mar de Chabannes, simultaneously caused <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a> to be sacrificed to the Scandinavian gods and gave much gold to the churches. <a href="13041b.htm">Richard I</a> was a great builder of churches, among them <a href="11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a> and the primitive <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, St. Michel du Mont, and the Trinity at F&eacute;camp. Richard II, <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> for monastic reform, brought from <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> Guillaume de St. B&eacute;nigne; the Abbey of F&eacute;camp, reformed by him, became a model <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and a much frequented <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>All these dukes protected the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> power of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, which in many States at that time limited the central power, was but little developed in Normandy, and it was to their kinsmen that the dukes of Normandy most often gave the <a href="13208b.htm">Archdiocese of Rouen</a> and other <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>. Ecclesiastical life in Normandy was vigorous and well-developed; previous to the eleventh century the rural <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were almost as numerous as they are today. Thus Normandy for nearly a century and a half was at once a sort of promontory of the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a> in face of Scandinavia and at the same time a coign of Scandinavia thrust into the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. Henceforth those Danes and Scandinavians who under the name of Normans formed a part of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, never called <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> Danes or Scandinavians to their aid unless threatened in the possession of Normandy; under their domination the land became a stronghold of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="06129a.htm">Fontenelle</a> pursued its religious and literary activity from the Merovingian period. The "Chronicon Fontanellense", continued to 1040, is an important source for the history of the period. The ducal <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Normandy early determined to have an historiographer whom they sought in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, one Dudon, dean of the chapter of St. Quentin, who between 1015-30 wrote in Latin half verse, half prose, a history of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> according to the traditions and accounts transmitted to him by Raoul, Count of Ivry grandson of Rollo and brother of Richard I Alinea. Duke Robert the Devil (1027-35) was already powerful enough to interfere efficaciously in the struggles of Henry I of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> against his own brother and the Counts of Champagne and <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. In gratitude the king bestowed on Robert the Devil, Pontoise, Chaumont en Vexin, and the whole of French Vexin. It was under Robert the Devil that the ducal <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Normandy first cast covetous glances towards <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. He sent an embassy to Canute the Great, King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, in order that the sons of Ethelred, Alfred and Edward, might recover their patrimony. The petition having been denied he made ready a naval expedition against <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, destroyed by a tempest. He died while on a <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>It was reserved for his son William the Bastard, later called William the Conqueror, to make <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> a Norman colony by the expedition which resulted in the victory of Hastings or Senlac (1066). It seemed, then, that in the second half of the eleventh century a sort of Norman imperialism was to arise in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, but the testament of William the Conqueror which left Normandy to Robert Courte-Heuse and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to William Rufus, marked the separation of the two countries. Each of the brothers sought to despoil the other; the long strife which Robert waged, first against William Rufus, afterwards against his third brother Henry I Beauclerc, terminated in 1106 with the battle of Tinchebray, after which he was taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and brought to Cardiff. Thenceforth Normandy was the possession of William I, King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and while forty years previous <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> seemed about to become a Norman country, it was Normandy which became an English country; history no longer speaks of the ducal <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Normandy but of the royal family of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Later Henry I, denounced to the Council of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> by Louis VI of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, explained to <a href="03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> in tragic terms the condition in which he had found Normandy. "The duchy", said he, "was the prey of brigands. Priests and other servants of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> were no longer <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a>, and <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> had almost been restored, in Normandy. The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which our ancestors had founded for the repose of their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> were destroyed, and the religious <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to disperse, being unable to sustain themselves. The churches were given up to pillage, most of them reduced to ashes, while the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were in hiding. Their parishioners were slaying one another." There, may have been some <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> in this description of Henry I; however, it is well to bear in mind that the Norman dukes of the eleventh century, while they had prepared and realized these astounding political changes, had also developed in Normandy, with the help of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, a brilliant literary and artistic movement.</p>

<p>The Abbey of Bec was for some time, under the direction of <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> and <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, the foremost <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of northern <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Two Norman <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> produced historical works of great importance; the "Historia Normannorum" written between 1070-87 by Guillaume Calculus at the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="08566a.htm">Jumi&egrave;ges</a>; the "Historia Ecclesiastica" of <a href="11278a.htm">Ordericus Vitalis</a>, which begins with the birth of Christ and ends in 1141, written at the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Evroult. The <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> of Normandy emulated the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>; in a sort of academy founded in the second half of the eleventh century by two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lisieux, Hugues of Eu and Gilbert Maminot, not only <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> but also scientific and literary questions were discussed. The Norman court was a kind of Academy and an active centre of literary production. The <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of Duchess Matilda, Gin de Ponthieu, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, composed in 1067 a Latin poem on the battle of Hastings; the <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of William the Conqueror, <a href="15637b.htm">William of Poitiers</a>, wrote the "Gesta" of his master and an extant account of the <a href="04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> is due to another Norman, Raoul de Caen, an eyewitness. At the same time the Norman dukes of the eleventh century restored the buildings, destroyed by the invasions of their barbarian ancestors, and a whole Romance <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of architecture developed in Normandy, extending to <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, Picardy, Brittany, and even to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Caen was the centre of this <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>; and monuments like the Abbaye aux Hommes and the Abbaye aux Dames, built at <a href="03132a.htm">Caen</a> by William and Matilda, mark an epoch in the history of Norman art.</p>

<p>In the course of the twelfth century the political destinies of Normandy were very uncertain. Henry I of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, master of Normandy from 1106-35, preferred to live at <a href="03132a.htm">Caen</a> rather than in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. His rule in Normandy was at first disturbed by the partisans of Guillaume Cliton, son of Robert Courte-Heuse, and later by the plot concocted against him by his own daughter Matilda, <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of <a href="07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a>, who had taken as her second husband Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou. When Henry I died in 1135 his body was brought to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; his death without male heirs left Normandy a prey to <a href="01452a.htm">anarchy</a>. For this region was immediately disputed between Henry Plantagenet, grandson of Henry I through his mother Matilda, and Thibaut of Champagne, grandson of William the Conqueror through his mother Ad&egrave;le. After nine years of strife Thibaut withdrew in favour of his brother Stephen who in 1135 had been <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. But the victories of Geoffrey Plantagenet in Normandy assured (1144) the rule of Henry Plantagenet over that land, which being thenceforth subject to Angevin rule, seemed destined to have no further connexion with <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Suddenly Henry Plantagenet, who in 1152 had married Eleanor (Ali&eacute;nor) of Aquitaine, <a href="05054c.htm">divorced</a> from Louis VII of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, determined to assert his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> over <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> itself. The naval expedition which he conducted in 1153 led Stephen to recognize him as his heir, and as Stephen died at the end of that same year Henry Plantagenet reigned over all the Anglo-Norman possessions, his territorial power being greater than that of the kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. A long series of <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> followed between the Capetians and Plantagenets, interrupted by truces. Louis VII wisely favoured everything which paralyzed the power of Plantagenet, and supported all his enemies. Thomas &agrave; Becket and the other exiles who had protested against the despotism which Henry exercised against the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, found refuge and help at the court of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; and the sons of Henry in their successive revolts against their father in Normandy, were supported first by Louis VII and then by <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>.</p>

<p>The prestige of the Capetian kings grew in Normandy when Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion succeeded Henry II in 1189. <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> profited by the enmity between Richard and his brother John Lackland to gradually establish French domination in Normandy. A <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between Richard and <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> resulted in the treaty of Issoudun (1195) by which <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> acquired for the French crown Norman Vexin and the castellanies of Nonancourt, Ivry, Pacy, Vernon, and Gaillon. A second <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between John Lackland, King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1199 and <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>, was terminated by the treaty of Goulet (1200), by which John Lackland recovered Norman Vexin, but recognized the French king's possession of the territory of <a href="05671a.htm">Evreux</a> and declared himself the "liege man" of <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>. Also when in 1202 John Lackland, having <a href="01032b.htm">abducted</a> Isabella of <a href="01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a>, refused to appear before <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>, the court of peers declared John a felon, under which sentence he no longer had the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to hold any fief of the crown. <a href="12001a.htm">Philip II Augustus</a> sanctioned the judgment of the court of peers by invading Normandy which in 1204 became a French possession. The twelfth century in Normandy was marked by the production of important works, chief of which was the "Romande Rou" of Robert or rather Richard Wace (1100-75), a canon of <a href="02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>. In this, which consists of nearly 17,000 lines and was continued by Beno&icirc;t de Sainte-More, Wace relates the history of the dukes of Normandy down to the battle of Tinchebray. Mention must also be made of the great French poem which the Norman Ambroise wrote somewhat prior to 1196 on the <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion. As early as the twelfth century Normandy was an important commercial centre. Guillaume de Neubrig wrote that <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> was one of the most celebrated cities of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and that the Seine brought thither the commercial products of many countries. The "Etablissementsde Rouen" in which was drawn up the "custom" adopted by Rouen, were copied not only by the other Norman towns but by the cities with which Rouen maintained constant commercial intercourse, e.g. Angoul&ecirc;me, <a href="02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>, Cognac, St. Jean d'Ang&eacute;ly, Niort, <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, <a href="09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, Saintes, and <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>. The <em>ghilde</em> of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, a powerful commercial association, possessed in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> from the time of Edward the Confessor the port of Dunegate, now Dungeness, near <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, and its merchandise entered <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> free.</p>

<p>Once in the power of the Capetians, Normandy became an important strategical point in the struggle against the English, masters of Poitou and Guyenne in the south of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Norman sailors were enrolled by Philip VI of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> for a naval campaign against <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1340 which resulted in the defeat of Ecluse. Under John II the Good, the States of Normandy, angered by the ravages committed by <a href="05321a.htm">Edward III of England</a> on his landing in the province voted (1348-50) subsidies for the conquest of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The Valois dynasty was in great danger when Charles the Bad, King of Navarre, who possessed important lands in Normandy, succeeded in 1356 in detaching from John II of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> a number of Norman barons. John II appraising the danger came suddenly to <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, put several barons to death, and took Charles the Bad <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Shortly afterwards Normandy was one of the provinces of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> most faithful to the Dauphin Charles, the future Charles V, and the hope the English entertained in 1359 of seeing Normandy ceded to them by the Preliminaries of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> was not ratified by the treaty of Br&eacute;tigny (1360); Normandy remained French. The victories of Charles V consolidated the prestige of the Valois in this province. In 1386 Normandy furnished 1387 vessels for an expedition against <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> never executed. In 1418 the campaign of Henry V in Normandy was for a long time paralyzed by the resistance of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, which finally capitulated in 1419, and in 1420 all Normandy became again almost English.</p>

<p>The Duke of Clarence, brother of Henry V of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, was made lieutenant-general in the province. Henry VI and the Duke of Bedford founded a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="03132a.htm">Caen</a> which had faculties of canon and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>, to which Charles VII in 1450 added those of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, medicine, and arts. This last attempt at English domination in Normandy was marked by the execution at <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> of <a href="08409c.htm">Blessed Joan of Arc</a>. English rule, however, was undermined by incessant conspiracies, especially on the part of the people of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, and by revolts in 1435-36. The revolt of Val de Vire is famous and was the origin of an entire ballad literature, called "Vauxde Vire", in which the poet Oliver Basselin excelled. These songs, which later became bacchic or amorous in character, and which subsequently developed into the popular drama known as "Vaudeville", were in the beginning chiefly of an historical nature recounting the invasion of Normandy by the English. Profiting by the public opinion of which the "Vauxde Vire" gave evidence, the Constable de Richemont opposed the English on Norman territory. His long and arduous efforts in 1449-50 made Normandy once more a French province. Thenceforth the possession of Normandy by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> was considered so essential to the security of the kingdom that Charles the Bold, for a time victorious over Louis XI, in order to weaken the latter, exacted in 1465 that Normandy should be held by Duke Charles de Berry, the king's brother and leader of those in revolt against him; two years later Louis XI took Normandy from his brother and caused the States General of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a> to proclaim in 1468 that Normandy could for no reason whatever be dismembered from the domain of the crown. The ducal ring was broken in the presence of the great judicial court called the Echiquier (Exchequer) and the title of Duke of Normandy was never to be borne again except by Louis XVII, the son of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>The Norman <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of architecture from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century produced superb Gothic edifices chiefly characterized by the height of their spires and bell-towers. Throughout the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Normandy, greatly influenced by <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> and the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> was distinguished for its veneration of the Blessed Virgin. It was under her protection that William the Conqueror placed his expedition to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. One of the most ancient mural <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> is in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Hospice St. Julien at Petit-Quevilly, formerly the manor <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of one of the early dukes of Normandy, portraying the Annunciation, the Birth of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the Blessed Virgin suckling the Infant <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> during the flight into <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. As early as the twelfth century Robert or rather Richard Wace wrote the history of Mary and that of the establishment of the feast of the Immaculate Conception. The Norman students at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> placed themselves under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception which thus became the "feast of the Normans"; this appellation does not seem to date beyond the thirteenth century. During the modern period the Normans have been distinguished for their commercial expeditions by sea and their voyages of discovery. As early as 1366 the Normans had established markets on the coast of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> and it was from Caux that Jean de B&eacute;thencourt set out in 1402 for the conquest of the Canaries. He opened up to <a href="06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a> the route to the Cape of Good Hope and to <a href="04140a.htm">Christopher Columbus</a> that to America. Two of his <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, Pierre Bontier and Jean le Verrier, gave an account of his expedition in a <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> known as "Le Canarien", edited in 1874. Jean Ango, born at Dieppe about the end of the fifteenth century, acquired as a ship-owner a fortune exceeding that of many princes of his time. The <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> having in time of peace, seized (1530) a ship which belonged to him, he sent a flotilla to blockade <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and ravage the <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> coast. The ambassador sent by the King of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a> to negotiate the matter, was referred to the citizen of Dieppe. Ango was powerful enough to assist the armaments of <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a> against <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. He died in 1551.</p>

<p>Jean Parmentier (1494-1543), another navigator and a native of Dieppe, was, it is held, the first <a href="06166a.htm">Frenchman</a> to take ships to <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>; to him is also ascribed the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of having discovered Sumatra in 1529. Poet as well as sailor, he wrote in verse (1536) a "Description Nouvelle des Merveilles de ce monde". The foundation by <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a> in 1517 of the "French City" which afterwards became Havre de Grace, shows the importance which French royalty attached to the Norman coast. Normandy's maritime commerce was much developed by Henry II and <a href="03443a.htm">Catherine de Medicis</a>. They granted to the port of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> a sort of monopoly for the importation of spices and drugs arriving by way of the Atlantic, and when they came to Rouen in 1550 the merchants of that town contrived to give to the nearby wood the appearance of the country of <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a> "with three hundred naked men, equipped like savages of America, whence comes the wood of <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>". Among these three hundred men were fifty real savages, and there also figured in this exhibition "several monkeys and squirrel monkeys which the merchants of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> had brought from <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>." The description of the festivities, which bore witness to active commercial intercourse between Normandy and America, was published together with numerous figures. After the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> religious <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> interrupted the maritime activity of the Normans for a time. Rouen took sides with the League, Caen with <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>, but with the restoration of peace the maritime expeditions recommenced. Normans founded Quebec in 1608, opened markets in <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a> in 1612, visited the Sonda Islands in 1617, and colonized Guadeloupe in 1635. The French population of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> is to a large extent of Norman origin. During the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> Normandy was one of the centres of the federalist movement known as the Girondin. Caen and Evreux were important centres for the Gironde; Buzot, who led the movement, was a Norman, and it was from Caen that Charlotte Corday set out to slay the "montagnard" Marat. The royalist movement of "la Chouannerie" had also one of its centres in Normandy.</p>
