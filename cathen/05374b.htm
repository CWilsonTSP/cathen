<p>(<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>electio</em>, from <em>eligere</em>, to choose from)</p>

<p>This subject will be treated under the following heads:</p>

<blockquote><p>I. Juridical Concept; <br>II. Electors; <br>III. Persons Eligible; <br>IV. The Act of Electing: Forms and Methods; <br>V. After Election; <br>VI. Elections Now in Use.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="section1">Juridical concept</h2>

<p>In its broadest sense election means a choice among many <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, things, or sides to be taken. In the stricter juridical sense it means the choice of one <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> among many for a definite charge or function. If we confine ourselves to ecclesiastical law, canonical election, in a broad sense, would be any designation of a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> to an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> charge or function; thus understood it includes various modes: <a href="12319c.htm">postulation</a>, presentation, <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a>, recommendation, request or petition, and, finally, free collation. In a narrower sense, election is the canonical appointment, by legitimate electors, of a fit <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> to an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office. Its effect is to confer on the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> thus elected an actual right to the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> or charge, independently of the confirmation or collation ulteriorly <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Hence it is easily distinguished from the aforesaid modes that only in a broad sense can be termed election.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(a) Postulation differs canonically from election, not as regards the electors, but as regards the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected, the latter being juridically ineligible on account of an impediment from which the superior is asked to dispense him. For instance, if in an episcopal election the canons designate the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of another see, or a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> under thirty years of age, or one of <a href="07650a.htm">illegitimate birth</a>, etc., no actual right would be conferred on such a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>, and the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior would be in no wise bound to recognize such action; hence the electors are then said to <em>postulate</em> their candidate, this <a href="12319c.htm">postulation</a> being a matter of favour (<em>gratia</em>), not of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>.</li><li>(b) Presentation, on the contrary, differs from election not in respect to the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected but to the electors; it is the exercise of the right of patronage, and the patron may be a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>, whereas the electors to <a href="04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> must be <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>. In both cases the right of the candidate is the same (<em>jus ad rem</em>); but while an election calls for canonical confirmation, presentation by a patron leads to <a href="08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> by a competent <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>. Moreover, when the right of patronage belongs to a moral body, e.g. a chapter or an entire congregation, presentation may have to follow along the lines of election. Though frequently called <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a>, the designation of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a> in virtue of <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a> is in reality presentation, and results in <a href="08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>.</li><li>(c) Correctly speaking, <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> is the canonical act by which the electors propose several fit <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> to the free choice of the superior. The r&ocirc;le of electors in <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> is the same as in election properly so called; as election, however, can fall only on one <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>, so <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> cannot confer on several a real right to a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> &mdash; rather, their right is real inasmuch as it excludes third parties, though none of them possesses the <em>jus ad rem</em> (c. Quod sicut, xxviii, De elect., lib. I, tit. vi).</li><li>(d) Recommendation is the name applied to the designation of one or several fit <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> made to the superior by certain members of the episcopate or <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, chiefly in view of sees to be filled (see <a href="02581b.htm">BISHOP</a>). It differs from election and <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> in that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or members of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> do not act as electors; hence the <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> designated do not acquire any real right, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> remaining perfectly free to make a choice outside of the list proposed.</li><li>(e) Still further removed from election is simple request, or petition, by which the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> or people of a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> beg the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to grant them the <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> they desire. The authors of this petition, not being properly qualified, as in the case of recommendation, to make known their appreciation of the candidate, it is needless to say the latter acquires no right whatsoever from the fact of this request.</li><li>(f) Finally, free collation is the choice of the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> by the superior who confers <a href="08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>; it is the method most in use for appointment to inferior <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and the practical rule for the filling of <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, apart from some well-known exceptions. Evidently, where free collation obtains, election, properly so called, is excluded.</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section2">Electors</h2>

<p>Electors are those who are called by ecclesiastical law or statute to constitute an electoral college, i.e. to designate the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of their choice, and who have the qualifications required for the exercise of their right to vote. The law appoints competent electors for each kind of election: <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> for the election of a pope; the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter for the election of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or a <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>; and the various chapters of their order, etc. for the election of regular <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>. In general, election belongs, strictly speaking, to the college, i.e. the body, of which the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected will become the superior or <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>; if this college have a legal existence, like a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, it can exercise its right as long as it exists, even if reduced to a single member, though, of course, such a one could not elect himself. Electors called upon to give a <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> must be <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Hence <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> are excluded from all participation in a canonical election; it would be invalid, not only if made by them exclusively (c. iii, h. t.), but even if they only co-operate with <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, every custom to the contrary notwithstanding. Ecclesiastics alone, and those only who compose the college or community to be provided with a head, can be electors. This is well exemplified in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, all of whose canons, and they alone, are episcopal electors. Other <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> have no <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to associate with the chapter in the election of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, unless; &mdash;</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(a) they are in full possession of this right and it is <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by long prescription;</li><li>(b) hold a pontifical privilege, or</li><li>(c) can show a right resultant from the foundation of the chapter or the church in question.  </li></ul></div>

<p>To exercise their right, the electors, whoever they may be, must be full members of the body to which they belong, and must, moreover, be in a condition to perform a juridical, <a href="01115a.htm">human act</a>. Hence <a href="09076a.htm">natural law</a> excludes the demented and those who have not reached the age of puberty; ecclesiastical law debars; &mdash;</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(1) canons who have not attained full membership in the chapter, i.e. who are not yet <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> (Council of Trent, Sess. XXII, c. iv, De ref.), and</li><li>(2) religious who have not made their profession.</li></ul></div>

<p>Moreover, in punishment of certain offences, some electors may have forfeited their right to elect, either for once or permanently, e.g. those <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by name, those suspended, or those placed under <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>. The Constitution of <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, "Ad evitanda scandala", permits the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> known as <em>tolerati</em> (tolerated) to take part in an election, but exception may be taken to them, and their exclusion must follow; if, after such exception, they cast a vote, it must be considered null. Apart from censures incurred, privation of an active share in elections occurs frequently in the ecclesiastical law affecting regulars; in <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> and for the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, it exists in only three cases: Electors lose the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to elect, for that time, first, when they have elected or postulated an unworthy <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> (c. vii, h. t.); second, when the election has been held in consequence of an abusive intervention of the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a> (c. xliii, h. t.); finally, when it has not been made within the required time. In all these cases the election devolves upon the superior (c. xli, h. t.).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section3">Persons eligible</h2>

<p>Those <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> are eligible who meet the requirements of common ecclesiastical law, or special <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>, for the charge or function in question; hence, for each election it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to ascertain what is required of the candidate. In general, for all kinds of elections, the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> qualifications are mature age, moral integrity, and adequate <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (c. vii, h. t.); for each charge or function dependent on an election these conditions are defined with more precision and fullness. Thus, neither a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> nor an ecclesiastic who is not yet a <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> can be elected <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and no regular can be elected superior, etc., unless he has made his final profession. Some of the aforesaid requirements are easily verified, e.g. the proper age, adequate <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the latter being presumable when the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> formally exacts an academic degree (Council of Trent, Sess. XXII, c. ii, De ref.); others, especially an upright life, must usually depend on negative evidence, i.e. on the absence of <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> to the contrary, such <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> being positive offences, particularly when they have seriously impaired the reputation of the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> in question or called for canonical punishment. It is principally candidates of censurable morality who are termed unworthy; the sacred canons constantly repeat that the unworthy must be set aside. Such unworthy <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> are:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(1) all outside the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, viz, infidels, <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and schismatics;</li><li>(2) all who have been guilty of great crimes (<em>crimina majora</em>), viz, the sacrilegious, forgers, <a href="11696a.htm">perjurers</a>, sodomites, and <a href="14001a.htm">simoniacs</a>;</li><li>(3) all whom law or fact, for whatever reason, has branded as <a href="08001a.htm">infamous</a> (<em>in fami&acirc; juris aut facti</em>);</li><li>(4) all under censure (<a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, suspension, <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>), unless said censure be occult;</li><li>(5) all whom an irregularity, particularly a penal one (<em>ex crimine</em>), debars from receiving or exercising <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>.</li></ul></div>

<p>Those also are excluded who, at the time of election, hold several incompatible <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> or dignities without <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> (c. liv, h. t.); or who, at a preceding election, have already been rejected as unworthy (c. xii, h. t.), and all who have consented to be elected through the abusive intervention of lay authority (c. xliii, h. t.). There are other cases in which regulars cease to be eligible. The legislation here described was meant for the episcopal elections of the thirteenth century and aims at abuses now impossible.</p>

<h2 id="section4">The act of election: forms and methods</h2>

<p>In this matter, even more than in the preceding paragraphs, we must consider special <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>. Strictly speaking, the common ecclesiastical law, which dates from the thirteenth-century <a href="04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, considers only episcopal elections (lib. I, tit. vi, De electione et electi potestate; and in VI&#186;). Since an election is held to appoint to a church or an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> charge or office that is vacant, it is obvious that the first condition requisite for an election is precisely the vacancy of said church, charge, or office, in consequence of death, transfer, resignation, or deposition; any election made with a view to filling an office not yet vacant is a canonical offence. When an election becomes <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the first step is to convoke the electoral assembly in some specified place, and for a certain day within the legal time-limit. The place is ordinarily the vacant church or, if it be question of an election in a chapter, wherever the deliberations of the chapter are usually held. The time-limit set by common ecclesiastical law is three months, after the lapse of which the election devolves upon the immediate superior (c. xli, h. t.). In an electoral college, the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of convoking the members belongs to the superior or president; in a chapter this would be the highest dignitary. He must issue an effectual summons, for which no special form is prescribed, to all the electors without exception, whether present in the locality or absent, unless, however, they be too far away. The distance considered as constituting a legitimate excuse for absence (see c. xviii, h. t.) should be more narrowly interpreted today than in the thirteenth century. It is unnecessary to convoke electors publicly known to be incompetent to exercise their electoral right, e.g. canons <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by name or not yet <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>. So binding is this convocation that if even one elector be not summoned he can, in all <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, enter a complaint against the election, though the latter is not <em>ipso facto</em> null by reason of such absence. Such an election will stand provided the unsummoned elector abides by the choice of his colleagues or abandons his complaint. As no one is bound to use a right, <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> does not <a href="11189a.htm">oblige</a> an elector to attend the assembly and take part in the voting; the absent are not taken into consideration. As a general rule the absent cannot be represented or vote by proxy unless, according to the chapter "Quia propter" (xlii, h. t., Lateran Council, 1215), they are at a great distance and can prove a legitimate hindrance. Moreover, they can choose as proxy only a member of the assembly, but they can commission him to vote either for a particular <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> or for whomsoever he himself may deem most worthy.</p>

<p>On the appointed day the president opens the electoral assembly. Though the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> requires no preliminary solemnities, such are frequently imposed by special statute, e.g. the Mass of the Holy Ghost, which should be attended by all the assembled electors and those not prevented from assisting; also the recital of certain <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Moreover, the electors are often <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> previously to promise under <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> that they will conscientiously vote for the most worthy. However, apart from such <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>, their <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> is none the less absolute and serious. These preliminaries over, the electoral assembly proceeds, if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to verify the credentials of certain electors, e.g. those who act as delegates, as happens in the general chapters of religious congregations. Then follows the discussion of the merits (<em>tituli</em>) of the candidates. The latter need not have previously made known their candidacy, though they may do so. The electors, nevertheless, have all freedom to propose and sustain the candidates of their choice. Frank and fair discussion of the merits of candidates, far from being forbidden, is perfectly conformable to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, because it tends to enlighten the electors; indeed, some maintain that an election made without such a discussion would be null or could be annulled (Matth&aelig;ucci, in <a href="06048a.htm">Ferraris</a>, "Bibliotheca", s.v. "Electio", art. iv, n. 5). It is more accurate to say that the election would be vitiated if the presiding officer were to oppose this discussion for the purpose of influencing votes. However, though the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> strictly prohibits cabals and secret negotiations in the interest of certain candidates, the line between illicit man&oelig;uvring and permissible negotiating is in practice not always easily recognizable. [See the Constitution "Ecclesi&aelig;" of <a href="08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> (22 Sept., 1695), on the elections of regulars (in <a href="06048a.htm">Ferraris</a>, art. iii, no. 26), also the regulations that govern a <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>.]</p>

<p>The discussion concluded, voting begins. Actually there is only one customary method, i.e. secret voting (<em>scrutinium secretum</em>) by written ballots. The common ecclesiastical law (c. Quia propter, xlii, h. t., Lateran Council, 1215) admits only three modes of election: the normal or regular method by ballot, and two exceptional modes, namely, compromise and quasi-inspiration. Recourse to lots is especially prohibited; nevertheless, the Sacred Congregation of the Council (Romana, Electionis, 2 May, 1857) ratified an election where the chapter, equally divided between two candidates in other respects fit, had drawn lots; just about as was done for the Apostolic election of St. Matthias. As to the two exceptional methods:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(1) Election by quasi-inspiration takes place when the electors greet the name of a candidate with enthusiasm and acclamation, in which event the ballot is omitted as useless since its result is known in advance, and the candidate in question is proclaimed elected. However, modern custom in this matter differs from ancient habits, and it is wiser, even in the case of such apparent unanimity, to proceed by ballot.</li><li>(2) Compromise occurs when all the electors confide the election to one or several specified <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, either members of the electoral college or strangers, and ratify in advance the choice made by such arbitrator or arbitrators.</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Formerly this exceptional method was often resorted to, either to terminate long and fruitless sessions, or when there was a lack of exact information concerning the candidates; it is minutely regulated by the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="04670b.htm">Decretals</a>. The compromise must be agreed to by all the electors without exception, and can be confided to <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> only. It may be absolute, i.e. leaving the arbitrators quite free, or conditional, i.e. accompanied by certain reservations concerning the manner of election, the <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> to be elected, the time-limit within which the election should be held, and so on.</p>

<p>The normal or regular method by ballot, according to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="04670b.htm">Decretals</a> was necessarily neither secret nor written. The law "Quia propter" (see above) merely calls for the choice of three trustworthy scrutineers from among the electors. These were charged with collecting secretly (in a whisper) and in succession the votes of all; the result was then drawn up in writing and made public. The candidate who had obtained the votes of the more numerous or sounder party (<em>major vel sanior pars</em>) of the chapter was declared elected. However, this appreciation, not only of the number but also of the value of the votes, led to endless discussions, it being <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to compare not only the number of votes obtained, but also the merits of the electors and their <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, i.e. the honesty of their intentions. It was presumed, of course, that the majority was also the sounder party, but <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> to the contrary was admitted (c. lvii, h.t.). The use of the secret and written ballot has long since remedied these difficulties. If the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not modify on this point the existing law, at least it exacted the secret ballot for the elections of regulars (Sess. XXV, c. vi, De regul.). According to this method the scrutineers silently collect the ballots of the electors present; when occasion requires it, certain members are <a href="04696b.htm">delegated</a> to collect the votes of sick electors beneath the same roof (e.g. at a <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> or at one of the regular chapters) or even in the city (for <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters), if the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> so prescribe. This accomplished, the scrutineers count the number of ballots collected, and if, as should be, they tally with the number of electors, the same officers proceed to declare the result. Each ballot is in turn opened, and one of the scrutineers proclaims the name inscribed thereon, then passes it to the second scrutineer for registration, while the third, or secretary, adds up the total number of votes obtained by each candidate. As a general rule, election is assured to the candidate who obtains the majority of votes, i.e. an absolute, not merely a relative, majority; however, certain <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> require, e.g. in a <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>, a majority of two-thirds. When the electors are odd in number, a gain of one vote ensures the majority; if the number be even, it requires two votes. In calculating the majority, neither absent electors nor blank ballots are taken into account; whoever casts a blank vote is held to have forfeited his electoral right for that ballot. If no candidate obtains an absolute majority, balloting is recommenced, and so on until a definitive vote is reached. However, not to prolong useless balloting, special <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> can prescribe, and in fact have provided, various solutions, e.g. that after three rounds of fruitless balloting the election shall devolve upon the superior; or again, that in the third round the electors can vote only between the two most favoured candidates; or, finally, that in the fourth round a relative majority shall suffice (Rules of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars for congregations of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> under simple <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, art. ccxxxiii sq.). Other special regulations provide for the case of two candidates receiving the same number of votes (the voters being of even number), in which event the election is decided in favour of the senior (by age, <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, or <a href="12451b.htm">religious profession</a>); sometimes the deciding vote is assigned to the presiding officer. For all these details it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> and observe the special legislation that covers them.</p>

<p>When the final vote is obtained, whatever its character, it should be made public, i.e. officially communicated to the electoral assembly by the presiding officer. The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of election is then drawn up; in other words, the document which verifies the voting and the election. The r&ocirc;le of the electoral college thus fulfilled, the election is closed.</p>

<p>The principal <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of an elector is to vote according to his <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, without allowing himself to be actuated by human or selfish motives, i.e., he must vote for him whom he deems the most worthy and best qualified among the <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> fit for the office in question. External law can scarcely go farther, but <a href="14601a.htm">moralists</a> rightly declare guilty of mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> the elector who, against his <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, casts his vote for one who is unworthy. In order, however, to fulfil his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, the elector has a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to be entirely free and uninfluenced by the dread of any <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> annoyance (<em>vexatio</em>) which might affect his vote, whether such annoyance be in its source civil or <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> (cc. xiv and xliii, h. t.).</p>

<h2 id="section5">After election</h2>

<p>We are confronted here by two hypotheses: either an election is or is not disputed. An election may be disputed by whoever is interested in it, in which case the question of its validity is referred to the superior, in accordance with the same rule as for judicial appeals. Now, an election may be defective in three ways, i.e. as to the electors, the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected, or the mode of election. The defect concerns the electors if, through culpable neglect, one or more of those who have a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to participate in the election are not summoned; or if <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>, <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicates</a> <em>vitandi</em>, or unauthorized <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> are admitted as electors. The defect lies with the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected if it can be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that he was not fit (<em>idoneus</em>), in which case he may be postulated, or that he was positively unworthy, in which event the election is invalid. Finally, the defect concerns the form or mode of election when the legal prescriptions relative to balloting or compromise have not been observed. The challenged election, with <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> of its imperfection, is judged canonically by the proper <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior. If the alleged defect is not proven, the election is sustained; if it be proven, the judge declares it, whereupon the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> provides the following sanctions: An election made by <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>, or with their assistance, is invalid (c. lvi, h. t.); the one at which an <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> has been admitted to vote, as also that to which an elector has not been invited, must be closely investigated, but is not to be annulled unless the absence of the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>, or the presence of the unsummoned elector might have given a different turn to the vote. The election of a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who is not unworthy, but simply the victim of an impediment, may be treated indulgently; that of an unworthy <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> is to be annulled, while the electors who, knowing him to be such, nevertheless elected him, are deprived for that time of the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to vote and are suspended for three years from the <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> they hold in the vacant church in question. Finally, the election wherein the prescribed form has not been observed must be annulled. In all of these cases the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to elect (<a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>) devolves upon the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (<a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, c. xviii, h. t., in VI&#186;); the only case in which it devolves upon the immediate superior is when the election has not been made within the prescribed time-limit.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, the election meets with no opposition the first <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of the presiding officer of the electoral college is to notify the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected that choice is made of his <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>. If he be present, e.g. in the elections of regulars, the notification takes place immediately; if he be absent, the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of election must be forwarded to him within eight days, barring legitimate hindrance. On his side, the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected is allowed a month within which to make known his acceptance or refusal, the month <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the time of receiving the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of election or the permission of the superior when such is <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. If the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected refuses the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> conferred upon him, the electoral college is summoned to proceed with a new election, under the same conditions as the first time and within a month. If he accepts, it is his right as well as his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to demand from the superior the confirmation of his election within the peremptory limit of three months (c. vi, h. t., in VI&#186;); but if, without legitimate hindrance, he allows this time to pass unused, the election has lapsed. From the moment of his acceptance, the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected acquires a real, though still incomplete, right to the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> or charge, the <em>jus ad rem</em> to be completed and transformed into full right (<em>jus in re</em>) by the confirmation of the election; it is his privilege to exact this confirmation from the superior, just as it is the latter's <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to give it, except in the event of unworthiness, of which fact the superior remains judge. However, until the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected has received this confirmation, he cannot take advantage of his still incomplete right to interfere in any way whatever in the administration of his <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>, the punishment being the invalidity of all administrative acts thus accomplished and privation of the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> itself. The <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation on this point is very severe, but it concerns <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> only. In the time of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216) those elected to an ordinary <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> had to seek the confirmation of their election from the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> only. Bishops outside of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> who had to obtain from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the confirmation of their election (<a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, or <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>) were authorized (c. xliv, h. t.), in cases of necessity, to enter at once on the administration of their churches, provided their election had aroused no opposition; meanwhile the confirmation proceedings went their ordinary course at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<p>At the <a href="09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a>, in 1274 (c. Avaniti&aelig;, v, h. t., in VI&#186;), elected <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> were forbidden, under penalty of deprivation of their dignity, to meddle in the administration of their <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> by assuming the title of administrator, <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a>, or the like. A little later, <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (Extrav., Injunct&aelig;, i, h. t.) established the rule still in force for entering on possession of major <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> and <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, according to which the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected must not be received unless he present to the provisional administrators the Apostolical Letters of his election, promotion, and confirmation. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> having established the <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> as provisional administrator of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> during the vacancy of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, it became <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to prohibit elected <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> from entering on the administration of their future <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the capacity of vicars capitular. This was done by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in the Constitution "Romanus Pontifex" (28 August, 1873), which recalls and renews the measure taken by <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. In this Constitution the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> declares that the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> "Avariti&aelig;" of the aforesaid Council of Lyons applies not only to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> elected by chapters, but also to candidates named and presented by heads of states in virtue of <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a>. He rules that chapters can neither appoint temporarily vicars capitular nor revoke their appointment. He also forbids them to designate as such <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> nominated by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>, or otherwise elected to a vacant church. Offences against this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> are severely punished, by <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> specially reserved to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and by privation of the revenues of their <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> for those dignitaries and canons who turn over the administration of their church to a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected or nominated. The same penalties are pronounced against said elected or nominated <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, and against all who give them aid, counsel, or countenance. Moreover, the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> elected or nominated forfeits all acquired right to the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>, while all acts performed during his illegitimate administration are declared invalid.</p>

<p>We may now return to the confirmation of the election according to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="04670b.htm">Decretals</a>. It belonged to the immediate superior. It was his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to extinguish all opposition by summoning the elected <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> to defend himself. Even if there were no opposition the superior was bound to summon, by a general edict posted on the door of the vacant church, all who might possibly dispute the election to appear within a fixed period; all this under penalty of the nullity of subsequent confirmation (c. xlvii, h. t., in VI&#186;). The superior had to examine carefully both the election and the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of the one elected, in order to satisfy himself that everything was conformable to law; if his investigation <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> favourable he gave the requisite confirmation whereby the elected <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> became definitively <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> of his church and received full <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. While the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> did not bind the superior to any strict time-limit for the granting of confirmation, it authorized the elected <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> to complain if the delay were excessive. All this <a href="09053a.htm">legislation</a>, especially elaborated for episcopal elections, is now no longer applicable to them; however, it is still in force for inferior <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, e.g. <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a>, when they are conferred by way of election.</p>

<h2 id="section6">Elections now in use</h2>

<p>Election, considered as the choice made by a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of its future <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, is verified first of all in the designation of a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="04192a.htm">CONCLAVE</a>). The election of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> by chapters is still, theoretically, the common rule, but the general reservation formulated in the second rule of the Apostolic Chancery has suppressed in practice the application of this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>; episcopal elections, in the strict sense of the word, occur now in only a small number of sees (see <a href="02581b.htm">BISHOP</a>). Finally, the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of regulars are normally appointed by election; the same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of abbesses. (See the Council of Trent, Sess. XXV, c. vi, De regul.) The common ecclesiastical law provides for no other elections. There are, however, other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> elections that do not concern real <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Religious communities of men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> under simple <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> proceed by election in the choice of superiors, superiors general, assistants general, and usually the members of the <a href="04423f.htm">general councils</a>. In <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a> it is by election that, on occasion of the vacancy of a see, the chapter appoints the <a href="15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> (Council of Trent, Sess. XXIV, c. xvi, De ref.). It is also according to the canonical form of election that colleges, especially chapters, proceed in appointing <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, e.g., to dignities and <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a>, when such appointment belongs to the chapter; to inferior <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> to which the chapter has a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to nominate or present; again in the appointment of delegates on <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> commissions (Council of Trent, Sess. XXIII, c. xviii, De ref.), or in bestowing on some of its members various capitulary offices, or making other such designations. The same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> groups, e.g. the chapters of collegiate churches, etc., also of confraternities and other associations recognized by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. In the latter cases, however, there is no election in the strictly canonical sense of the term.</p>
