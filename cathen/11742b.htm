<p>Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, one of the greatest pioneers of modern <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, born at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 12 January, 1746; died at Brugg, 17 February, 1827. Descended from a <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and destined to become a preacher, Pestalozzi abandoned this project for the study of law. He was greatly influenced by Rousseau's "Social Contract" and "Emile", and tried to carry into practice some of that author's <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. He first took up farming at Neuhof (New Farm), but failed through lack of practical talent. He then gathered at Neuhof (1774) waifs and castaways, who were to work in his spinning-mill and to receive in turn some industrial and moral training. Unbusiness-like methods led to financial difficulties and the closing of the establishment in 1780. Evil days then followed for Pestalozzi and his heroic wife who had sacrificed all her <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> for his schemes; sometimes they lacked bread and fuel, and illness added to their suffering. Sympathizing with the poor peasantry, Pestalozzi developed a plan for elevating their condition through <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. In 1781 appeared his "Lienhard und Gertrud", a simple story which shows how a village was regenerated through the efforts of a good <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>, an able magistrate, a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> teacher, and chiefly through the influence of Gertrude, a perfect wife and mother, who becomes the Good <a href="13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> of the village. This book, eagerly read wherever German was understood, made its author famous. In 1798 Pestalozzi determined to become a schoolmaster himself. The village of Stanz had been burnt by the French soldiers, and many children wandered about destitute, exposed to physical and moral ruin. Pestalozzi was made the head of an institution at Stanz in which the <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a> were to be trained. When, in the following year, the French army needed the building for a <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a>, the <a href="11322b.htm">orphans'</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> came to a sudden end.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Pestalozzi then opened a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in the Castle of Burgdorf, and there laboured <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> from 1799 to 1804, though hampered by jealousies and misunderstandings. With this institution he connected a normal <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, the first in the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cantons of <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> already possessed one, in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Urban, Canton of <a href="09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>; At Burgdorf Pestolazzi wrote "Wie Gertrud ihre Kinder lehrt" (How Gertrude Teaches her Children), which, better than any other of his books, explains his <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> aims and methods. When sent to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> as one of the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> delegates, he tried to interest the First Consul in his <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> work, but <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> declared that he would not be bothered about questions of A B C. In 1804 Pestalozzi, driven out of the Castle of Burgdorf, transferred his <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> to Munchenbuchsee, and thence to Yverdun. Eager students of pedagogy flocked to Yverdun from <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and other countries, among the rest Fr&ouml;bel, Herbart, von Raumer, and Ritter. But Pestalozzi's lack of organizing talent and dissensions among his teaching staff led to the decline and finally to the closing of the establishment (1825).</p>

<p>Pestalozzi's career is almost a puzzle. All his undertakings <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> failures, and yet he is the most influential of modern educators. There was nothing attractive in his external appearance. He had read very few books, possessed neither <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> penetration nor mastery of method, and entirely lacked talent for organization. A keen observer at Yverdun declared that he would not have been able to conduct successfully a small village <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. That; in spite of all these drawbacks, he exerted a profound influence on modern <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> was due chiefly to his self-sacrificing <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for children, and his enthusiasm for <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> work. This enthusiasm became an inspiration, almost an infection for all those who came in contact with "Father Pestalozzi", as they affectionately called him. He created a new <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> spirit, interest in <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and a new <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> atmosphere, namely, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for the children. He himself said that he intended to "psychologize instruction", and he may be called the originator of the modern <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> tendency in <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. The foundation of instruction he finds in <em>Anschauung</em>, which has been inadequately rendered in English by "sense-impression" or "observation", and is perhaps better expressed by "intuition". The object lesson is the core of the whole system, and exercises are based more on the study of objects than of words. Pestalozzi's system has been severely criticized by some and extravagantly praised by others; his work is overestimated by those who call him the "father of the elementary school", although it must be admitted that he did much to improve it. Some of his principles involved contradictions, not a few of his methods were one-sided and even unsound; but his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, stripped of their eccentricities by his disciples, became prominent features in modern <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. Herbart and Fr&ouml;bel supplemented his work&mdash;the former by developing the <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, the latter by originating the kindergarten system. The <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> systems of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and other <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> states embodied many of Pestalozzi's <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>; in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> a modified Pestalozzianism was carried into practice by Dr. Mayo. Pestalozzian <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> were transplanted to America by one of Pestalozzi's assistants, the Alsatian Joseph Neef (wrongly called a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, e.g. in Schmid's "Gesch. der Erz.", V, ii, 580), who opened a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in Philadelphia in 1808, and later taught at New Harmony, <a href="07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. Horace Mann was influenced by Pestalozzian principles; so was the "Oswego Movement", which emphasized the use of objects as the foundation of instruction and greatly determined the character of American normal-school training. "For the most part, so far as principle is concerned, American <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> are yet upon the Pestalozzian basis, though the special methods of applying these principles have been much improved" (Monroe, "Hist. of Ed.", 669).</p>

<p>One of the weakest points in Pestalozzi's system was his attitude towards religion. Through the influence of the writings of Rousseau he had lost the strict religious views of his <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, and, while he still believed in a personal <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, his was a <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> and merely natural religion. Although he always spoke most reverently of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> and of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he never attained to a clear recognition of the Divinity of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but remained outside dogmatic <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. His disciples are divided into two <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>&mdash;one <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a>, led by Diesterweg, the other <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, which follows Pestalozzian methods of instruction without adopting his religious views. To the latter <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> belong some prominent <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> educators, as Bishop Sailer of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and Bernard Overberg, the reformer of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. In dealing with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and in speaking of things <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Pestalozzi invariably showed tact and consideration; he never forgot that he had received kind treatment from <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at Stanz at a time when he was distrusted by some and ridiculed as a visionary by others. "You will hardly believe", he wrote to a friend, "that it was the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin Friars</a> and the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Convent that showed the greatest sympathy with my work."</p>
