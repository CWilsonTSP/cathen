<p><img alt="Image" align="right" src="../images/14301a01.gif" data-pagespeed-url-hash="1531732183" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);">A <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestment composed of a strip of material from two to four inches wide and about eighty inches long. It has either a uniform width throughout, or is somewhat narrower towards the middle, widening at the ends in the shape of a trapezium or spade. A small cross is generally sewed or <a href="05400a.htm">embroidered</a> on the stole at both ends and in the middle; the cross, however, is prescribed only for the middle, where the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="08663a.htm">kisses</a> the stole before putting it on. There are no express <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> concerning the material of the stole, but silk, or at least a half-silk fabric, is most appropriate. Stoles for festivals are generally ornamented with <a href="05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, especially what are called vesper stoles".</p>

<h2>Present use</h2>

<p>The stole is worn only by <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> it is the specific mark of office, being the badge of the diaconal and <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> orders. The wrongful use of the stole by <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, therefore, would imply the usurpation of a higher order, and would constitute an irregularity. <a href="04647c.htm">Deacons</a> wear the stole like a sash, the vestment resting on the left shoulder and thence passing across the breast and back to the right side. The stole of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> extends from the back of the neck across the shoulders to the breast, where the two halves either cross each other or fall down straight according as the stole is worn over the <a href="01251b.htm">alb</a> or the <a href="14343d.htm">surplice</a>. The stole is worn by a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the same manner as a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, except that it is never crossed on the breast, as a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> wears the <a href="11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a>. As a mark of order the stole is used in a special <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, at the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. At the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> places it on the left shoulder of the candidate, saying: "Receive from the hand of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> the white garment and fulfil thy <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, for <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is mighty enough to give thee His grace in rich measure." At the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> draws the part of the stole that rests at the back of the candidate's neck forward over the breast and lays the two ends crosswise, saying: "Receive the yoke of the Lord, for His yoke is sweet and His burden is light." The Sacred Congregation of Rites has given a large number of decisions concerning the use of the stole. As a general rule it may be stated: the stole is only used, and must be used, at a function peculiar to the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a function that presupposes the order (e.g., at the celebration of Mass, when the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is touched, when the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are administered), but not for example, in processions or at <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. The wearing of the stole by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Solemn <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> is an exception; its use by a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> while preaching depends on local custom. The stole is not a specific mark of <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The use of the stole is also customary in the Oriental rites, in which, as in the West, it is one of the chief <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> vestments (Greek, 6pdpiov, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon's</a> stole, and irrpaXXtop, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> stole; <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, urar; Syrian and Chaldaic, uroro; Coptic, batrashil). According to present Oriental custom the stole is a strip of silk about seven or eight inches wide, having at the upper end a hole through which the head is inserted; it is either undivided (Syrian, Coptic, and <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> custom) or opens down the front from the opening for the head (Greek custom). Among the Chaldeans (<a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>) the stole of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> resembles that used in the West, and is, like this, crossed over the breast. The <a href="04647c.htm">deacon's</a> stole generally hangs down straight from the left shoulder both in front and at the back, but in certain rites is first wound like a sash around the breast and back. Among the Syrians and Chaldeans the <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> also uses the stole, but he first twists it like a scarf around the neck, the ends being then let hang from the left shoulder in front and behind.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>We possess few references to the stole anterior to the ninth century. In the East, however, it is mentioned very early, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon's</a> stole being frequently referred to even in the fourth and fifth centuries. The <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> stole is not mentioned in the East until the eighth century. The stole is first mentioned in the West in the sixth and seventh centuries (Synod of <a href="02728a.htm">Braga</a>, 563; Fourth Council of Toledo, 633; Gallican explanation of the Mass), but then as a thing which had long been in use. The earliest evidences of the use of the stole at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> date from the second half of the eighth century and the beginning of the ninth. But in the ninth century, <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> and <a href="01106a.htm">acolytes</a> still wore both the planeta and the stole, although, to distinguish them from the <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, there were definite limitations to their use of the latter vestment. After the ninth century the stole is very frequently mentioned, and even then the manner of its use was essentially the same as today. In the ninth and tenth centuries in the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were commanded to wear the stole constantly as a badge of their calling, especially when on a journey. In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Gaul in the pre-Carlovingian period, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> wore the stole over the tunic like the Greeks; in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> this practice was continued until at least the thirteenth century; at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> the stole is still worn over the <a href="04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>. The custom for the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to wear the stole crossed in front of the breast at Mass was known as early as the <a href="02729a.htm">Synod of Braga</a> (675), but did not become general until the late <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Very little is known concerning the nature of the stole in the pre-Carlovingian period. Originally it was probably a cloth folded into the form of a band, and gradually developed into a simple band. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries the stole was very long, and at the same time extremely narrow. It was customary, even in the ninth century, to ornament the ends with fringe, tassels, or little bells. Towards the thirteenth century the ends came to be trapezium-shaped; in the fourteenth century this shape disappeared, and until the sixteenth century the stole was a strip of material of uniform width, and only ornamented with fringe at the ends. During the course of the sixteenth century it began again to be customary to broaden the ends of the stole; the eighteenth century produced the ugly stoles, in which the ends seemed to spread out into huge spades; these were also called "pocket stoles". It was not until the sixteenth century that it became customary to place a cross in the centre and at the ends of the stole; in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> this practice was unusual.</p>

<h2>Origin</h2>

<p>Various hypotheses have been suggested concerning the origin of the stole. The theory formerly universally held, but quite wrong, that it originated in the ornamental trimming of a garment called "stole", which in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> disappeared leaving behind only this trimming, has been abandoned. The theory that traced the stole to the Jewish <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> mantle has also been given up. At the present time the stole is either traced back to a <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> napkin, which <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> are said to have carried, or to a neckcloth formerly peculiar to <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> or it is regarded as a <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> badge (introduced at the latest in the fourth century) which first came into use in the East, and then in the West. It was also brought, as it would seem, to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where it was not at first adopted as a badge of the higher orders of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but as a distinctive mark of the Roman <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in general. The giving of the stole to the candidate at <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was intended to convey a double symbolism; first, that the elevation to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> occurred de benedictione S. Petri, and secondly that by <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> the candidate entered the service of St. Peter, that is of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. It was also customary before the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> to lay the oraria upon the Confessio of St. Peter. This <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> badge was called orarium on account of its similarity to the secular orarium both in shape and material, and in the way it was worn. (For further details as to the various hypotheses concerning the origin of the name, cf. J. Braun, "Die liturgische Gewandung", 608-20.) The name "stole", as the designation of the orarium, is of <a href="06395b.htm">Gallic</a> origin, not Roman. As early as the ninth century the expression "stole" prevailed in the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire; it made its entrance into <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> about the tenth century, and here also came rapidly into general use. From the thirteenth century the name orarium appears only in isolated instances.</p>
