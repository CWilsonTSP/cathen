<p>The <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> is the cup in which the wine and water of the Eucharistic Sacrifice is contained. It should be either of gold, or of silver with the cup gilt on the inside or it may have a cup only of silver, gilt on the inside; in which case the base and stem may be of any metal, provided it be solid, clean, and becoming (Miss. Rom., Ritus celebr., tit. i, n. 1). According to the Roman <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> (De Defectibus, tit. x, n. 1) it may be also made of <em>stannum</em> (an alloy of tin and lead), with the cup gilt on the inside, but authors permit this only by way of exception in case of extreme poverty. Chalices made of glass, wood, copper, or brass are not permitted, and cannot be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Cong. Sac. Rit., 16 September, 1865). The base may be round, hexagonal, or octagonal, and should be so wide that there is no fear of the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> tilting over. Near the middle of the stem, between the base and the cup, there should be a knob, in order that the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a>, especially after the Consecration, when the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> has his thumb and index finger joined together may be easily handled. This knob may be adorned with precious stones but care should be taken that they do not protrude so far as to hinder the easy handling of the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a>. The base and cup may be embellished with pictures or emblems, even in relief, but those on the cup should he about an inch below the lip of the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a>. The cup should be narrow at the bottom, and become gradually wider as it approaches the mouth. The rounded or turned-down lip is very unserviceable. The height is not determined, but it should be at least eight inches.</p>

<h2>Patens</h2>

<p>The <a href="11541b.htm">paten</a> is a vessel of the altar on which the altar-bread is offered in the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. It should be made of the same material as the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and if it is made of anything else than gold it should be gilt on the concave side. Its edge ought to be thin and sharp, so that the particles on the corporal may be easily collected. It should not be embellished, at least on the concave side, in any manner; however, one small cross may be set near its edge to indicate the place on which it is to be <a href="08663a.htm">kissed</a> by the celebrant. Any sharp indentation on the upper side prevents its being easily cleaned. Those having a plain surface throughout, with the gradual slight depression towards the centre, are the most serviceable. By a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Cong. Sac. Rit., 6 December, 1866, <a href="12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> allowed <a href="03561a.htm">chalices</a> and <a href="11541b.htm">patens</a> to be used which were made of aluminium mixed with other metals in certain proportions given in the "Instructio", provided the whole surface was silvered, and the cup gilt on the inside, but this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> is expunged from the latest edition of the Decrees. Both the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> and the <a href="11541b.htm">paten</a>, before they can be used at the <a href="10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, must be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the ordinary, or by a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> designated by him. Only in exceptional cases can a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, who has received special faculties for doing so from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> them. By virtue of Facultates Extraordinariae C, fac. vi, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> may delegate a simple <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. The mere fact of celebrating the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> with an unconsecrated <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> and <a href="11541b.htm">paten</a> can never supply the place of this rite, specially <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Loss of consecration</h2>

<p>The <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> loses its <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> when it becomes unfit for the purpose for which it is destined. Hence it becomes devoid of <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>: (1) when the slightest break or slit appears in the cup near the bottom. This is not the case if the break be near the upper part, so that without fear of spilling its contents <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> can take place in it. (2) When a very noticeable break appears in any part, so that it would be unbecoming to use it. (3) When the cup is separated from the stem in such a manner that the parts could not be joined except by an artificer, unless the cup was originally joined to the stem, and the stem to the base, by means of a screwing device. If, however, to the bottom of the cup a rod is firmly attached which passes through the stem to the base, under which is a nut used to hold the different parts together, then, if this rod should break, <em>tutius videtur</em> to reconsecrate it. (4) When it is regilt (Cong. Sac. Rit., 14 June, 1845). A <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> does not lose its <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> by the mere wearing away of the gilding, because the whole <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> is <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; but it becomes unfit for the purpose of consecrating in it, for the <a href="13216a.htm">rubric</a> prescribes that it be gilded on the inside. After being regilt, the celebrating of Mass with the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> cannot supply its <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> (St. Lig., bk. VI, n. 380). The custom of <a href="04748c.htm">desecrating</a> a <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a>, or other sacred vessel, by striking it with the hand or some instrument, or in any other manner, before giving it to a workman for regilding, is positively forbidden (Cong. Sac. Rit., 23 April, 1822). By making slight repairs upon the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> or <a href="11541b.htm">paten</a> the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> is not lost. The Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office in 1874 decided that a <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> loses its <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> if it is employed by <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> for any profane use, e.g. for a drinking cup at table. The <a href="11541b.htm">paten</a> loses its <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>: (1) When it is broken to such an extent that it becomes unfit for the purpose for which it is intended, e.g. if the break be so large that particles could fall through it. (2) When it becomes battered to such an extent that it would be unbecoming to use it. (3) When it is regilt. A <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> which becomes unserviceable is not to be sold, but should, if possible, be used for some sacred purpose.</p>

<h2>Ciborium</h2>

<p>The <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a> is an altar-vessel in which the <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> particles for the Communion of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> are kept. It need not necessarily be made of gold or silver, since the <a href="13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> (tit. cap. i, n. 5) merely prescribes that it be made <em>ex solida decentique materia.</em> It may even be made of copper provided it be gilt (Cong. Sac. Rit., 31 August, 1867). If made of any material other than gold, the inside of the cup must be gilt (Cong. Episc. et Reg., 26 July, 1588). It must not be made of <a href="08257b.htm">ivory</a> (ibid.) or glass (Cong. Sac. Rit., 30 January, 1880). Its base should be wide. its stem should have a knob, and it may be embellished and adorned like the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> (<em>vide supra</em>). There should be a slight round elevation in the centre, at the bottom, in order to facilitate the taking out of the particles when only a few remain therein. The cover, which should fit tightly, may be of pyramidal or a ball shape, and should be surmounted by a cross. The <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a> ought to be at least seven inches high. It is not <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, but only blessed by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> having the requisite faculties according to the form of the "Benedictio tabernaculi" (Rit. Rom., tit. iii, xxiii). As long as the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is reserved in it, the <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a> must be covered with a veil of precious material of white colour (Rit. Rom., tit. iv, 1, n. 5), which may be <a href="05400a.htm">embroidered</a> in gold and silver and have fringes about the edges. When it does not actually contain the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, this veil must be removed. Hence, after its purification at Mass, or when filled with new particles to be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, it is placed on the <a href="01362a.htm">altar</a>, the veil cannot be put on it. Even from the Consecration to the Communion it remains covered. Just before placing it in the tabernacle after Communion the veil is placed on it. It is advisable to have two ciboria as the newly <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> particles must never be mixed with those which were <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> before. In places in which <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> is carried solemnly to the sick, a smaller <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a> of the same style is used for this purpose. The little <a href="12588a.htm">pyx</a> used for carrying <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> to the sick is made of the same material as that of which the <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a> is made. It must be gilt on the inside, the lower part should have a slight elevation in the centre, and it is blessed by the form "Benedictio tabernaculi" (Rit. Rom., tit. viii, xxiii). The <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a> and <a href="12588a.htm">pyx</a> lose their blessing in the same manner as the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> loses its <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Ostensorium</h2>

<p>The <a href="11344a.htm">ostensorium</a> (<em>ostensory, <a href="11344a.htm">monstrance</a></em>) is a glass-framed shrine in which the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is publicly exposed. It may be of gold, silver, brass, or copper gilt (Cong. Sac. Rit., 31 August, 1867). The most appropriate form is that of the sun emitting its rays to all sides (Instructio Clement., 5). The base should be wide, and at a short distance above it there should be a knob for greater ease in handling. The <a href="11344a.htm">ostensorium</a> must be surmounted by a cross. (Cong. Sac. Rit., 11 September, 1847). It should not be embellished with small <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, as these and the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> are forbidden to be placed on the altar during solemn Benediction. At the sides of the receptacle in which the lunula is placed it is appropriate to have two <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> representing adoring <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>. In the middle of the Ostensorium here should be a receptacle of such a size that a large Host may be easily put into it; care must be taken that the Host does not touch the sides of this receptacle. On the front and back of this receptacle there should be a crystal, the one on the back opening like a door, when closed, the latter must fit tightly. The circumference of this receptacle must either be of gold or, if of other material, it should be gilt and so smooth and polished that any particle that may fall from the Host will be easily detected and removed. The lunula must be inserted and recovered without difficulty, hence the  need for keeping it in an upright position should be construed with this end in view. The <a href="11344a.htm">ostensorium</a> need not necessarily be <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a>, but it is better that it should be. The form "Benedictio tabernaculi" (Rit. Rom., tit. viii, xxiii) or the form "Benedictio ostensorii" (Rit. Rom., in Appendice) may be used. When carried to and from the altar it ought to be covered with a white veil.</p>

<p>The lunula (lunette) is made of the same material as the <a href="11344a.htm">ostensorium</a>. If it be made of any material other than gold, it must be gilded (Cong. Sac. Rit., 31 August, 1867). In form it may be either of two crescents or of two crystals encased in metal. If two crescents be used, the arrangement should be such that they can be separated and cleaned. Two stationary crescents, between which the Sacred Host is pressed, are, for obvious reasons, not serviceable. If two crystals are used it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that they be so arranged that the Sacred Host does not in any way touch the glass (Cong. Sac. Rit., 14 January, 1898). The <a href="11344a.htm">ostensorium</a>, provided it contains the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, may be placed in the tabernacle, but then it should be covered with a white silk veil. (Recent authors say that since the <a href="11344a.htm">ostensorium</a> is intended merely <em>ad monstrandam</em> and not <em>ad asservanduam SS. Eucharistiam</em> it should not be placed in the tabernacle.) When the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is taken out of the <a href="11344a.htm">ostensorium</a> after Benediction it may or may not be removed from the lunula. If it is removed it should, before being placed in the tabernacle, be enclosed in a receptacle, called the repository (<em>custodia, repositorium, capsula</em>), which is made like the <a href="12588a.htm">pyx</a>, used in carrying <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> to the sick, but larger, and may have a base with a very short stem. If the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> be allowed to remain in the crescent-shaped lunula both It and the lunula may be placed in the same kind of receptacle, or in one specially made for this purpose, having a device at the bottom for keeping the Sacred Host in an upright position. The latter may have a base and short stem, and a door, which fits tightly, on the back part, through which the lunula is inserted. This receptacle is made throughout of silver or of other material, gilt on the inside, smooth and polished, and surmounted by a cross. No corporal is placed in it. If the lunula be made of two crystals, encased in metal, it may, when containing the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, be placed in the tabernacle without enclosing it in a custodia. If the host be placed before the Consecration in the lunula made of two crystals, the latter must be opened before the words of Consecration are pronounced. The lunula and custodia are blessed with the form "Benedictio Tabernaculi" (Rit. Rom., tit. viii, xxiii) by a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or by a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> having the faculty. They lose their blessing when they are regilt, or when they become unfit for the use for which they are intended. All the sacred vessels, when not actually containing the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, should be placed in an iron safe, or other secure place, in the <a href="13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, so as to be safeguarded against <a href="14564b.htm">robbery</a> or profanation of any kind. Each ought to be placed in its own case or covered with a separate veil, for protection against dust and dampness.</p>
