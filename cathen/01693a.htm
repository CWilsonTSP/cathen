<p>(<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>archidiaconos</em>; Greek <em>archidaikonos</em>).</p>

<p>The incumbent of an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office dating back to antiquity and up to the fifteenth century of great importance in <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration, particularly in the West. The term does not appear before the fourth century, and is then first met with in the history of the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, written about 370 by Optatus of Mileve (I, xvi, ed. Corp. Script. Eccl. Lat., XXVI, 18). However, as he here bestows the title on Caecilian, a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Carthage early in the fourth century, it would appear that since that period there was an occasional use of the name. Towards the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth century, the term begins to appear more frequently both among Latin and Greek authors. We also occasionally find other names used to indicate the office, e.g. <em>ho tou chorou diakonon hegoumenos</em> (<a href="14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, <a href="../fathers/27021.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.26</a>). The term soon acquired fixity, all the more rapidly as the archdiaconal office became more prominent and its <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> were more sharply defined.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The beginnings of the archdiaconate are found in the first three centuries of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> era. The immediate predecessor of the archdeacon is the <em>diaconus episcopi</em> of primitive <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> times, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> whom the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> selected from the diaconal college (see <a href="04647c.htm">D<font size=-2>EACON</font></a>) for his personal service. He was made an assistant in the work of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration, was charged with the care of the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and was supervisor of the other <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> in their administration of <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>. He thus became the special <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a>, or <em>oeconomus</em> of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, and was also entrusted with the surveillance of the subordinate <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In this early period the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <em>diaconus episcopi</em> were not juridically defined, but were performed under the direction of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and for the time specified by him. Beginning with the fourth century this specialized activity of the <em>diaconus episcopi</em> takes on gradually the character of a juridical <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office. In the round of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration certain <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> appear attached by the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> to the office of the archdeacon. Thus, in the period from the fourth to the eighth century the archdeacon is the official supervisor of the subordinate <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, has disciplinary authority over them in all cases of wrong doing, and exercises a certain surveillance over their discharge of the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> assigned them. It was also within the archdeacon's province to examine candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; he had also the right of making visitation among the rural <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It was even his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, in exceptional cases of episcopal neglect, to safeguard the interests of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; to his hands were entrusted the preservation of the Faith in its primitive purity, the custody of <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, and the prevention of damage to the <a href="12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>. The archdeacon was, moreover, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> chief confidant, his assistant, and when it was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, his representative in the exercise of the manifold <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the episcopal office. This was especially the case in the administration of <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, the care of the sick, the visitation of <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, and the training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>.</p>

<p>In the East there was no further development of the archdiaconate, but in the West a new stage was inaugurated with the eighth century. By virtue of his office the archdeacon became, next to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the regular organ of supervision and discipline in the diocese. In this respect he was assigned a proper and independent <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> (<em>jurisdictio propria</em>) and even as late as the twelfth century there was a constant effort to increase the scope of this authority. The great amount of business to be transacted necessitated in large <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the appointment of several archdeacons. The first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to introduce this innovation was Heddo of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, who in 774 divided his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> into seven archdiaconates (<em>archidiaconatus rurales</em>). His example was quickly followed throughout <a href="09022a.htm">Western Christendom</a>, except in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> where the majority of the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were so small as to need no such division of authority. Henceforth the archdiaconus magnus of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (usually the <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a> or <em>praepositus</em> of the chapter), whose <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> chiefly concerned the city <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, is offset by the <em>archidiaconi rurales</em> placed over the deans (<em>archipresbyteri rurales</em>). These archdeacons were generally <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, either canons of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or provosts of the principal (collegiate) churches in small towns. The authority of the archdeacons culminated in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. At that time they exercised within the province of their archdiaconates a quasi-episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. They made visitations, during which they were empowered to levy certain assessments on the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>; they conducted courts of first instance, and had the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to punish <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> guilty of lapses; they could also hold synodal courts. But the archdeacon was not only as judge; he was also prominent in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. He saw that the archpriests performed their <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, gave canonical investiture to the holders of <a href="12371a.htm">prebends</a>, and authorized incorporation of the same; he supervised the administration of church revenues, and kept in repair the places of worship. He could also draw up the legal documents called for in the exercise of the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office and the performance of the juridical acts that it entailed. It came about frequently that the archdeacons were not appointed by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> but were chosen by the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter; sometimes they received their office from the king. After the twelfth century, on account of the vast extent of their <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, they were aided by various officials and vicars appointed by themselves. This great authority <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> in time very burdensome to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and brought with it too great a limitation of the episcopal authority. In the thirteenth century numerous <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> began to restrict the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the archdeacons. They were forbidden to employ their own special <em>officiales</em> and were prohibited from exercising their authority when the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was present in their territory. They were also deprived of the right of freely visiting the <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of their archdiaconate, of deciding important points of matrimonial causes, and of passing sentence on <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> guilty of grave crimes. Moreover, by the creation of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> office of <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, there was opened a court of higher resort than that of the archdeacon, and to it reverted the greater part of the business once transacted in the court of the archdeacon. When finally the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1553) provided that all matrimonial and criminal causes should be henceforth brought before the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Sess. XIV, xx, De reform.); that the archdeacon should no longer have the power to <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> (Sess. XXV, iii, De ref.); that proceedings against <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> unfaithful to their <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> should no longer be carried on before the archdeacon (Sess. XXV, xiv, De ref.) and that archdeacons should make visitations only when authorized by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and then render to him an account of them (Sess. XXIV, iii, De ref.), the archdiaconate was completely bereft of its independent character. From this time the <em>archidiaconatus rurales</em> gradually disappeared from the places where they still existed. The archdiaconate of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, where the office was still retained, soon became practically an empty title; the chief <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the incumbent were to assist the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his pontifical <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> and to vouch for the moral worthiness of candidates for <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Among <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> preserved, along with the primitive <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, the office of archdeacon with its own special <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In German <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with less congruity, the title of archdeacon was conferred on the first <em>Unterpfarrer</em>, or assistant <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>.</p>
