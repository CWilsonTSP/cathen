<p>The Hospital of the Holy Ghost at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was the cradle of an order, which, beginning in the thirteenth century, spread throughout all the countries of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and whose incalculable services have been recognized by every historian of medicine. Speaking of the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> itself, La Porte du Theil calls it "a useful establishment the most beautiful, the largest, and the best-ordered perhaps that exists at present, I say not in this queen of cities, I say in any civilized <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>". The famous Virchow of <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, an unbeliever, says, in speaking of the order: "It is just to recognize that it was reserved for the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, above all for <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, not merely to tap this source of charity and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> mercy in its plenitude, but to diffuse its beneficent flood in a methodical manner to every sphere of social life." Not that the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of gathering together the sick in order that they might be assured of the care of a community of infirmarians was new in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nevertheless, a mistake must not be made on this point. The <em>hospitium</em>, the <em>domus hospitalis</em>, the <em>xenodochium</em>, which are mentioned before the thirteenth century, were in general only a refuge for alien (<em>hospites</em>, <em>xenoi</em>) travellers, poor wanderers, and <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> so numerous in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The sick were treated at their homes in accordance with the words of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: "Infirmus (eram) et visitastis me" (I was sick, and you visited me. &mdash; <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs36">Matthew 25:36</a>). The first <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> in the modern sense of the word found their origin in the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> under the name of <em>infirmitoria</em>. During the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> period, in the absence of a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine, medical <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> found a refuge in the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The care of the sick formed part of the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of charity imposed upon the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. Hence there were two sorts of infirmaries, the <em>infirmitorium fratrum</em> within the <em>clausura</em>, and the <em>infirmitorium pauperum</em> or <em>seculi</em> without.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From the time of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusades</a> the <em>hospitia</em> of the Holy Land, those of the <a href="07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of St. John and the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, were of a mixed character; founded for the reception of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the Holy Places, they also served as <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> for the sick. They became at the same time, as is well known, military in character, and to this circumstance may be credited the repeated attempts to give a military character to the <a href="07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of the Holy Ghost, although they have never earned arms nor had occasion to use them. Two circumstances led to the creation of the <a href="07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of the Holy Ghost by <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>: the example given in Provence by Guy de Montpellier, who established in his native town a lay community for the care of the sick under the patronage of the Holy Ghost (it is not known what <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to choose this patronage; perhaps the Holy Ghost was chosen as the <em>Spiritus amoris</em>); the second cause was a foundation of Anglo-Saxon origin already existing on the banks of the Tiber. This was a simple <em>hospitium</em> founded in 715 by King Ina for his countrymen and known by the name of Hospitale S. Mari&aelig; in Sassia, around which was formed a quarter called the <em>Schola Saxonum</em>. In the course of centuries the buildings had fallen to ruin, but the endowments were still available and were appropriated by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to the new institute. A first <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> building was erected in the same quarter, and Guy de Montpellier was called to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to organize the service of the sick.</p>

<p>In the beginning the institution was in the hands of <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>, <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> confining himself to attaching to it four <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> for spiritual <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, responsible only to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or his delegate. In return he endowed the institution with the most extensive privileges, hitherto reserved to the great monastic orders; exemption from all spiritual and temporal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> save his own, the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to build churches, to nominate <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, and to have their own cemeteries. The signal was given; everywhere there arose filial <a href="04340c.htm">houses</a> modelled after the mother-house, while houses already in existence hastened to seek affiliation in order to enjoy these great privileges; the filial <a href="04340c.htm">houses</a> swarmed in turn, and thus formed a network of colonies dependent immediately or mediately on the Holy Ghost at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and enjoying the same privileges on condition of adopting the same rule, of submitting to periodical visitation, and of paying a light contribution to their <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. At the end of the thirteenth century the order numbered in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> more than 180 houses, and a century later nearly 400. In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> the list drawn up by Virchow counts about 130 houses at the end of the fourteenth century. Another historian reaches a figure of 900 houses at the same period for the whole of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, but he does not call it complete. The central authority, residing at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was vested in a master-general, later called <em>commander</em>, a general chapter held each year at Pentecost, and the visitors delegated by the chapter.</p>

<p>An outburst of generosity responded to this display of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> mercy; donations of every sort, in lands and revenues, poured in, which enriched the order and gave rise to a temporal administration modelled on that of the <a href="10304d.htm">military orders</a>. Thus their possessions were grouped into commanderies, which were soon invaded by <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> (many of them married), and thus arose the self-styled "Militia of the Holy Ghost". These lay <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a> assumed the revenues of these commanderies on condition of furnishing to the order an annual contribution analogous to the <em>responsions</em> of the <a href="10304d.htm">military orders</a>. This was an abuse to which <a href="12126c.htm">Pius II</a> put an end by appropriating these <a href="12371a.htm">prebends</a> of the Holy Ghost to a new order founded by him in 1459 under the name of Our Lady of Bethlehem. In 1476 <a href="14032b.htm">Pope Sixtus IV</a> decreed further that the commanderies should be given only to religious. As to the magisterial commandery at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it was nearly always reserved for a <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the Roman Court. Under Guy de Montpellier and his early successors the two houses of <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> remained under the obedience of a common master general. When, later, two separate masters came to be appointed, it was decreed that the arch-hospital of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> should collect the revenues of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and that the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> should have <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the houses of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the other countries of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Subsequent to this division of the order, confirmed in 1619 by <a href="11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>, Oliver of Terrada, invested with the dignity of general of the order in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, abused it to renew the Militia of the Holy Ghost. He proceeded to distribute brevets of knighthood to men of all classes, to <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>, often married, which gave rise to protests on the part of the religious of the order. <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> first abolished this knighthood by an edict of 1672, which gave the goods of the Order of the Holy Ghost to the Order of Notre Dame de Mont-Carmel, founded to procure pensions for gentlemen who had served in his armies. The Knights of the Holy Ghost opposed the execution of this edict, the withdrawal of which they secured, in 1692, by means of a compromise according to which they pledged themselves to recruit and equip a regiment for the service of the king. However, the religious of the Order of the Holy Ghost opposed this edict in their turn, and in 1700, after lengthy proceedings, they finally secured victory in an edict which declared that the Order of the Holy Ghost was purely regular and in no way military. The buildings of the Arcispedale di Santo Spirito of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which dated from the days of <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> (1471-84) are being reconstructed; they included a central hail, capable of containing 1000 beds, and decorated with frescoes, and special wards for contagious and for dangerous insane cases. A <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> was reserved for the physicians, surgeons, and infirmarians, who numbered more than a hundred. The church and the commander's palace date from the time of <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a> (1534-49). The annual revenue was estimated at 500,000 livres. Under the government of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, the Arcispedale was a catholic institution, that is to say a universal institution open to all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, irrespective of country, fortune, or condition. Today (1909) it is merely a municipal institution, reserved for the inhabitants of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<p>A distinction must be drawn between this order and the Royal Order of the Holy Spirit founded in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by King Henry III, in 1578, to supersede the Order of St. Michael of Louis XI, which had fallen into discredit, and to commemorate his accession to the throne on Pentecost Sunday. This was a purely secular order of the court.</p>
