<p>Founder of the <a href="12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a>, commonly known as the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>; born at Calaroga, in <a href="03410b.htm">Old Castile</a>, c. 1170; died 6 August, 1221. His <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, Felix Guzman and Joanna of Aza, undoubtedly belonged to the nobility of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, though probably neither was connected with the reigning house of <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a>, as some of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> biographers assert. Of Felix Guzman, personally, little is known, except that he was in every sense the worthy head of a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. To nobility of blood Joanna of Aza added a nobility of <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> which so enshrined her in the popular veneration that in 1828 she was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>. The example of such <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> was not without its effect upon their children. Not only Saint Dominic but also his brothers, Antonio and Manes, were distinguished for their extraordinary <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Antonio, the eldest, became a <a href="13675a.htm">secular priest</a> and, having distributed his patrimony to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, entered a <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> where he spent his life ministering to the sick. Manes, following in the footsteps of Dominic, became a Friar Preacher, and was <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The birth and infancy of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> were attended by many marvels forecasting his heroic <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and great achievements in the cause of religion. From his seventh to his fourteenth year he pursued his elementary studies under the tutelage of his maternal uncle, the <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> of Gumiel d'Izan, not far distant from Calaroga. In 1184 Saint Dominic entered the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="11417c.htm">Palencia</a>. Here he remained for ten years prosecuting his studies with such ardour and success that throughout the ephemeral existence of that institution he was held up to the admiration of its scholars as all that a student should be. Amid the frivolities and dissipations of a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> city, the life of the future saint was characterized by seriousness of purpose and an austerity of manner which singled him out as one from whom great things might be expected in the future. But more than once he <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that under this austere exterior he carried a heart as tender as a <a href="15687b.htm">woman's</a>. On one occasion he sold his books, annotated with his own hand, to relieve the starving poor of <a href="11417c.htm">Palencia</a>. His biographer and contemporary, Bartholomew of Trent, states that twice he tried to sell himself into slavery to obtain money for the liberation of those who were held in captivity by the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a>. These facts are worthy of mention in view of the cynical and saturnine character which some non-Catholic writers have endeavoured to foist upon one of the most charitable of men. Concerning the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> his biographers are silent; nor is there anything from which that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> can be inferred with any degree of <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>. According to the deposition of Brother Stephen, Prior Provincial of <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, given in the process of <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a>, Dominic was still a student at <a href="11417c.htm">Palencia</a> when Don Martin de Bazan, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11339a.htm">Osma</a>, called him to membership in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter for the purpose of assisting in its reform. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> realized the importance to his plan of reform of having constantly before his canons the example of one of Dominic's eminent <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Nor was he disappointed in the result. In recognition of the part he had taken in converting its members into canons regular, Dominic was appointed sub-prior of the reformed chapter. On the accession of Don Diego d'Azevedo to the Bishopric of <a href="11339a.htm">Osma</a> in 1201, Dominic became superior of the chapter with the title of prior. As a canon of <a href="11339a.htm">Osma</a>, he spent nine years of his life hidden in <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and rapt in contemplation, scarcely passing beyond the confines of the <a href="03584a.htm">chapter house</a>.</p>

<p>In 1203 Alfonso IX, King of Castile, deputed the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11339a.htm">Osma</a> to demand from the Lord of the Marches, presumably a <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> prince, the hand of his daughter on behalf of the king's son, Prince Ferdinand. For his companion on this embassy Don Diego chose Saint Dominic. Passing through <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in the pursuit of their mission, they beheld with amazement and sorrow the work of spiritual ruin wrought by the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigensian heresy</a>. It was in the contemplation of this scene that Dominic first conceived the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of founding an order for the purpose of combating <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and spreading the light of the Gospel by preaching to the ends of the then known world. Their mission having ended successfully, Diego and Dominic were dispatched on a second embassy, accompanied by a splendid retinue, to escort the <a href="02537c.htm">betrothed</a> princess to Castile. This mission, however, was brought to a sudden close by the death of the young <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> in question. The two <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were now free to go where they would, and they set out for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, arriving there towards the end of 1204. The purpose of this was to enable Diego to resign his <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> that he might devote himself to the conversion of unbelievers in distant lands. <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, however, refused to approve this project, and instead sent the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his companion to Languedoc to join forces with the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, to whom he had entrusted the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. The scene that confronted them on their arrival in Languedoc was by no means an encouraging one. The <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, on account of their worldly manner of living, had made little or no headway against the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. They had entered upon their work with considerable pomp, attended by a brilliant retinue, and well provided with the comforts of life. To this display of worldliness the leaders of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> opposed a rigid asceticism which commanded the respect and admiration of their followers. Diego and Dominic quickly saw that the failure of the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> apostolate was due to the <a href="10487b.htm">monks'</a> indulgent habits, and finally prevailed upon them to adopt a more austere manner of life. The result was at once apparent in a greatly increased number of converts. Theological disputations played a prominent part in the propaganda of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Dominic and his companion, therefore, lost no time in engaging their opponents in this kind of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> exposition. Whenever the opportunity offered, they accepted the gage of battle. The thorough training that the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> had received at <a href="11417c.htm">Palencia</a> now <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> of inestimable value to him in his encounters with the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Unable to refute his arguments or counteract the influence of his preaching, they visited their <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> upon him by means of repeated insults and threats of physical <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a>. With Prouille for his head-quarters, he laboured by turns in Fanjeaux, <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, <a href="13732a.htm">Servian</a>, B&eacute;ziers, and <a href="03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a>. Early in his apostolate around Prouille the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> realized the necessity of an institution that would protect the <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> of that country from the influence of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Many of them had already embraced <a href="01267e.htm">Albigensianism</a> and were its most active propagandists. These <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> erected <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, to which the children of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nobility were often sent&mdash;for want of something better&mdash;to receive an <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and, in effect, if not on purpose, to be tainted with the spirit of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. It was needful, too, that <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> converted from <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> should be safeguarded against the <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> influence of their own homes. To supply these deficiencies, Saint Dominic, with the permission of Foulques, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, established a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at Prouille in 1206. To this community, and afterwards to that of Saint Sixtus, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he gave the rule and constitutions which have ever since guided the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Second <a href="12354c.htm">Order of Saint Dominic</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The year 1208 opens a new epoch in the eventful life of the founder. On 15 January of that year <a href="12079d.htm">Pierre de Castelnau</a>, one of the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a>, was assassinated. This abominable crime precipitated the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> under Simon de Montfort, which led to the temporary subjugation of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Saint Dominic participated in the stirring scenes that followed, but always on the side of mercy, wielding the arms of the spirit while others wrought death and desolation with the sword. Some historians assert that during the sack of B&eacute;ziers, Dominic appeared in the streets of that city, cross in hand, interceding for the lives of the <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> and children, the aged and the infirm. This testimony, however, is based upon documents which <a href="15001b.htm">Touron</a> regards as certainly <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. The testimony of the most reliable historians tends to prove that the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> was neither in the city nor in its vicinity when B&eacute;ziers was sacked by the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. We find him generally during this period following the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> army, reviving religion and reconciling <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> in the cities that had capitulated to, or had been taken by, the victorious de Montfort. It was probably 1 September, 1209, that Saint Dominic first came in contact with Simon de Montfort and formed with him that intimate friendship which was to last till the death of the <a href="06147a.htm">brave</a> <a href="04543c.htm">crusader</a> under the walls of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (25 June, 1218). We find him by the side of de Montfort at the siege of Lavaur in 1211, and again in 1212, at the capture of La Penne d'Ajen. In the latter part of 1212 he was at <a href="11435b.htm">Pamiers</a> labouring, at the invitation of de Montfort, for the restoration of religion and morality. Lastly, just before the battle of Muret, 12 September, 1213, the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> is again found in the council that preceded the battle. During the progress of the conflict, he <a href="06423a.htm">knelt</a> before the altar in the church of Saint-Jacques, <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> for the triumph of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> arms. So remarkable was the victory of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> at Muret that Simon de Montfort regarded it as altogether <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, and piously attributed it to the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Saint Dominic. In gratitude to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for this decisive victory, the <a href="04543c.htm">crusader</a> erected a <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the church of Saint-Jacques, which he dedicated, it is said, to <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> of the <a href="13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. It would appear, therefore, that the devotion of the <a href="13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, which tradition says was revealed to Saint Dominic, had come into general use about this time. To this period, too, has been ascribed the foundation of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> by Saint Dominic, and his appointment as the first <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisitor</a>. As both these much controverted questions will receive special treatment elsewhere in this work, it will suffice for our present purpose to note that the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was in operation in 1198, or seven years before the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> took part in the apostolate in Languedoc, and while he was still an obscure canon regular at <a href="11339a.htm">Osma</a>. If he was for a certain time identified with the operations of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, it was only in the capacity of a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> passing judgment upon the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the accused. Whatever influence he may have had with the judges of that much maligned institution was always employed on the side of mercy and forbearance, as witness the classic case of Ponce Roger.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> increasing reputation for heroic <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, <a href="15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, and profound learning <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be much sought after as a candidate for various <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. Three distinct efforts were made to raise him to the episcopate. In July, 1212, the chapter of B&eacute;ziers chose him for their <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Again, the canons of Saint-Lizier wished him to succeed Garcias de l'Orte as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Comminges. Lastly, in 1215 an effort was made by Garcias de l'Orte himself, who had been transferred from Comminges to <a href="02067c.htm">Auch</a>, to make him <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10721a.htm">Navarre</a>. But Saint Dominic absolutely refused all episcopal honours, saying that he would rather take flight in the night, with nothing but his staff, than accept the episcopate. From Muret Dominic returned to <a href="03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a>, where he resumed his preaching with unqualified success. It was not until 1214 that he returned to <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. In the meantime the influence of his preaching and the eminent <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of his life had drawn around him a little band of devoted disciples eager to follow wherever he might lead. Saint Dominic had never for a moment forgotten his purpose, formed eleven years before, of founding a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order to combat <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and propagate religious <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. The time now seemed opportune for the realization of his plan. With the approval of Bishop Foulques of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, he began the organization of his little band of followers. That Dominic and his companions might possess a fixed source of revenue Foulques made him <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of Fanjeaux and in July, 1215, canonically established the community as a religious congregation of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, whose mission was the propagation of <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and good <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, and the extirpation of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. During this same year Pierre Seilan, a wealthy citizen of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, who had placed himself under the direction of Saint Dominic, put at their disposal his own commodious dwelling. In this way the first <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a> was founded on 25 April, 1215. But they dwelt here only a year when Foulques established them in the church of <a href="13163a.htm">Saints Romanus</a>. Though the little community had <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> amply the need of its mission and the efficiency of its service to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, it was far from satisfying the full purpose of its founder. It was at best but a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> congregation, and Saint Dominic had dreamed of a world-order that would carry its apostolate to the ends of the earth. But, unknown to the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, events were shaping themselves for the realization of his hopes. In November, 1215, an <a href="04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> was to meet at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> "to deliberate on the improvement of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, the extinction of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and the strengthening of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>". This was identically the mission Saint Dominic had determined on for his order. With the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, he was present at the deliberations of this council. From the very first session it seemed that events conspired to bring his plans to a successful issue. The council bitterly arraigned the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for their neglect of preaching. In canon X they were directed to delegate capable men to preach the word of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to the people. Under these circumstances, it would reasonably appear that Dominic's request for confirmation of an order designed to carry out the mandates of the council would be joyfully granted. But while the council was anxious that these reforms should be put into effect as speedily as possible, it was at the same time opposed to the institution of any new <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and had legislated to that effect in no uncertain terms. Moreover, preaching had always been looked upon as primarily a function of the episcopate. To bestow this office on an unknown and untried body of simple <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> seemed too original and too bold in its conception to appeal to the conservative <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> who influenced the deliberations of the council. When, therefore, his petition for the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of his infant institute was refused, it could not have been wholly unexpected by Saint Dominic.</p>

<p>Returning to Languedoc at the close of the council in December, 1215, the founder gathered about him his little band of followers and informed them of the wish of the council that there should be no new rules for <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. Thereupon they adopted the ancient rule of Saint Augustine, which, on account of its generality, would easily lend itself to any form they might wish to give it. This done, Saint Dominic again appeared before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the month of August, 1216, and again solicited the confirmation of his order. This time he was received more favourably, and on 22 December, 1216, the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of confirmation was issued.</p>

<p>Saint Dominic spent the following <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> preaching in various churches in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> court. It was at this time that he received the office and title of <a href="10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a>, or Pope's Theologian, as it is more commonly called. This office has been held uninterruptedly by members of the order from the founder's time to the present day. On 15 August, 1217, he gathered the brethren about him at Prouille to deliberate on the affairs of the order. He had determined upon the heroic plan of dispersing his little band of seventeen unformed followers over all <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The result <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> the wisdom of an act which, to the eye of human <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> at least, seemed little short of <a href="14326b.htm">suicidal</a>. To facilitate the spread of the order, <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, on 11 Feb., 1218, addressed a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> to all <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a>, requesting their favour on behalf of the <a href="12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a>. By another <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 3 Dec., 1218, <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> bestowed upon the order the church of Saint Sixtus in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Here, amid the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Appian Way, was founded the first <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the order in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Shortly after taking possession of Saint Sixtus, at the invitation of Honorius, Saint Dominic began the somewhat difficult task of restoring the pristine observance of religious discipline among the various Roman communities of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. In a comparatively short time the work was accomplished, to the great satisfaction of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. His own career at the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, and the practical use to which he had put it in his encounters with the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, as well as his keen appreciation of the needs of the time, convinced the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> that to ensure the highest efficiency of the work of the apostolate, his followers should be afforded the best <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> advantages obtainable. It was for this reason that on the dispersal of the brethren at Prouille he dispatched Matthew of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and two companions to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. A foundation was made in the vicinity of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, and the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> took possession in October, 1217. Matthew of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> was appointed superior, and Michael de Fabra was placed in charge of the studies with the title of Lecturer. On 6 August of the following year, Jean de Barastre, dean of Saint-Quentin and professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, bestowed on the community the hospice of Saint-Jaques, which he had built for his own use. Having effected a foundation at the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, Saint Dominic next determined upon a settlement at the <a href="02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a>. Bertrand of Garrigua, who had been summoned from <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and John of Navarre, set out from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with letters from <a href="07452b.htm">Pope Honorius</a>, to make the desired foundation. On their arrival at Bologna, the church of Santa Maria della Mascarella was placed at their disposal. So rapidly did the Roman community of Saint Sixtus grow that the need of more commodious quarters soon became urgent. Honorius, who seemed to delight in supplying every need of the order and furthering its interests to the utmost of his power, met the emergency by bestowing on Saint Dominic the basilica of Santa Sabina.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1218, having appointed Reginald of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> his vicar in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, accompanied by several of his brethren, set out for <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Bologna, Prouille, <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and Fanjeaux were visited on the way. From Prouille two of the brethren were sent to establish a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Segovia was reached just before <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a>. In February of the following year he founded the first <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the order in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Turning southward, he established a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> at <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, similar to the one at Prouille. It is quite probable that on this journey he personally presided over the erection of a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in connexion with his alma mater, the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="11417c.htm">Palencia</a>. At the invitation of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, a house of the order was established in that city. Again bending his steps towards <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he recrossed the Pyrenees and visited the foundations at <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. During his stay in the latter place he caused houses to be erected at <a href="09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, and Orl&eacute;ans, which in a short time became centres of <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> activity. From <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> he directed his course towards <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, arriving in Bologna in July, 1219. Here he devoted several months to the religious formation of the brethren he found awaiting him, and then, as at Prouille, dispersed them over <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Among the foundations made at this time were those at <a href="02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a>, <a href="15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, and <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a>. From Bologna he went to <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. His arrival at the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> court was the signal for the showering of new favours on the order. Notable among these marks of esteem were many complimentary letters addressed by Honorius to all those who had assisted the Fathers in their vinous foundations. In March of this same year Honorius, through his representatives, bestowed upon the order the church of San Eustorgio in <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>. At the same time a foundation at <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> was authorized. On his return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, towards the end of 1219, Dominic sent out letters to all the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> announcing the first general chapter of the order, to be held at Bologna on the feast of the following Pentecost. Shortly before, <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, by a special <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>, had conferred upon the founder the title of Master General, which till then he had held only by tacit consent. At the very first session of the chapter in the following spring the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> startled his brethren by offering his resignation as master general. It is needless to say the resignation was not accepted and the founder remained at the head of the institute till the end of his life.</p>

<p>Soon after the close of the chapter of Bologna, <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> addressed letters to the <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a> of San Vittorio, Sillia, Mansu, Floria, Vallombrosa, and Aquila, ordering that several of their religious be deputed to begin, under the leadership of Saint Dominic, a preaching <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> in <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, where <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> had developed alarming proportions. For some reason or other the plans of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> were never realized. The promised support failing, Dominic, with a little band of his own brethren, threw himself into the field, and, as the event <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>, spent himself in an effort to bring back the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> to their allegiance to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is said that 100,000 unbelievers were converted by the preaching and the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>. According to <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> and others, it was during his preaching in <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> that the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> instituted the Militia of Jesus Christ, or the third order, as it is commonly called, consisting of men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> living in the world, to protect the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>. Towards the end of 1221 Saint Dominic returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the sixth and last time. Here he received many new and valuable concessions for the order. In January, February, and March of 1221 three consecutive <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> were issued commending the order to all the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the Church. The thirtieth of May, 1221, found him again at Bologna presiding over the second general chapter of the order. At the close of the chapter he set out for <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> to visit <a href="06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a>, to whom he was especially indebted for many substantial acts of kindness. He had scarcely returned to Bologna when a fatal illness attacked him. He died after three weeks of sickness, the many trials of which he bore with heroic patience. In a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> dated at <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, 13 July, 1234, <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> made his cult <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> throughout the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>The life of St. Dominic was one of tireless effort in the service of God. While he journeyed from place to place he <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> and preached almost uninterruptedly. His penances were of such a nature as to cause the brethren, who accidentally discovered them, to fear the effect upon his life. While his charity was boundless he never permitted it to interfere with the stern sense of <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> that guided every action of his life. If he abominated <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and laboured untiringly for its extirpation it was because he <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of those among whom he laboured. He never failed to distinguish between <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and the sinner. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if this athlete of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who had conquered himself before attempting the reformation of others, was more than once chosen to show forth the power of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. The failure of the fire at Fanjeaux to consume the dissertation he had employed against the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and which was thrice thrown into the flames; the raising to life of Napoleone Orsini; the appearance of the annals in the refectory of Saint Sixtus in response to his <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, are but a few of the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> happenings by which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> was pleased to attest the eminent <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of His servant. We are not surprised, therefore, that, after signing the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> on 13 July, 1234, <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> declared that he no more <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> the saintliness of Saint Dominic than he did that of Saint Peter and <a href="11567b.htm">Saint Paul</a>.</p>
