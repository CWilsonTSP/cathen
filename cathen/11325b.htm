<p>One of the most ancient and distinguished <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="13164a.htm">Roman</a> nobility, whose members often played an important r&ocirc;le in the history of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, particularly in that of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>.</p>

<p>The Roman or principal line of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, from which branched off a series of collateral lines as time went on, may be traced back into the early <a href="10285c.htm">middle Ages</a>, and a legendary ancestry goes back even as far as early Roman times. The Roman line, as well as its branches, had large possessions in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and were the rulers of numerous and important dominions, fortified towns, and strongholds. In <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the Orsini were the hereditary enemies of the equally distinguished Colonna: in the great <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> conflict between <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and empire, the latter were for the most part on the side of the emperor and the leaders of the <a href="07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> party, while the Orsini were ordinarily champions of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and leaders of the <a href="07056c.htm">Guelph</a> party. The Orsini gave three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; <a href="03478b.htm">Celestine III</a>, <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, and <a href="02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> &#151; as well as many <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and numerous <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Other members of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> distinguished themselves in political history as warriors or statesmen, and others again won renown in the fields of art and <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. The <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> between the Orsini and Colonna form an important part of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> history of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of Central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Forming as they did a part of the conflicts waged by the emperors in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, they influenced in a very prominent manner the general historical development of that time.</p>

<h2>Cardinals of the Orsini family</h2>

<p>Among the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the Orsini <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> who were distinguished in the <a href="07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>, as well as in ecclesiastico-political history, the following are especially worthy of mention:--</p>

<p>(1) MATTEO ROSSO ORSINI, nephew of Cardinal Gaetano Orsini (later <a href="11056a.htm">Pope Nicholas III</a>), created a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> in December, 1262; d. 4 Sept., 1305 (according to some authorities, 1306). As <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> for the provinces of the <a href="14257a.htm">Patrimony of Peter</a> and of the Marches, he fought against Peter de Vico, who, in the name of Manfred, invaded the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> territory with German mercenaries. Soon after the elevation of his uncle, <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne (1277), he was named by this <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> of the <a href="13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>, <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the great Hospital of the Holy Ghost in Vatican territory, and cardinal protector of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. After the death of <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> (1280), the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> assembled in <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> for the election of his successor, but, owing to party dissensions, many months passed before a decision was reached. The party which inclined towards the French, and which had the support of Charles of Anjou, King of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, himself present in <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, wished to elect an exponent of the policy of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and chose as their candidate the French Cardinal Simon. However, the two <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> Orsini, Matteo Rosso and <a href="06564b.htm">Giordano</a>, the latter a brother of the deceased <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, energetically opposed this choice. As neither party could command the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> majority, no election resulted. In February, 1281, the French party resolved to have recourse to a bold stroke. At the instigation of the marshal of the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>, Annibaldi, who was at variance with the Orsini, citizens from <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> suddenly attacked the anti-French <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and took <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a> the two Orsini, carrying them away from the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> and holding them in custody. The candidate of the French party was now elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> (22 February, 1281), whereupon <a href="06564b.htm">Giordano</a> was released, and afterwards Matteo Rosso. The instigator of the attack was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and the city of <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> placed under an <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>. When the news of the capture of the two Cardinals Orsini was received in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, great confusion ensued. Their relatives were driven from the city by the adherents of the Annibaldi, but were later recalled by <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>, with whom the Cardinals Orsini had become reconciled. During the conflict between <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> and <a href="12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, it was Cardinal Matteo who, having remained faithful to the <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> pontiff, brought <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a> back to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> after the attack of <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a> (1303). Cardinal Matteo attended the numerous <a href="04192a.htm">conclaves</a> held between 1254 and 1305, there being no less than thirteen. He died in <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a> in 1305 or 1306. His body was later transferred to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where it lies in the Orsini Chapel in <a href="13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.</p>

<p>(2) NAPOLEONE ORSINI, son of Rinaldo, a brother of <a href="11056a.htm">Pope Nicholas III</a>, b. 1263; d. at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 24 March, 1342. In his youth he embraced the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, was appointed <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> by <a href="07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> (1285-7), was created <a href="03333b.htm#d">Cardinal Deacon</a> of S. Adriano by <a href="11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> in May, 1288, and later, under <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a> was named <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> of <a href="13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. Commissioned by <a href="02662a.htm">Pope Boniface VIII</a>, he brought <a href="11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> back to its submission to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, shortly after which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> named him <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> for Umbria, <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, and the <a href="01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>. In this capacity he left the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> on 27 May, 1300, returning, however, on 28 May, 1301. During this time he had to combat various enemies of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and recovered the city of <a href="07055a.htm">Gubbio</a> for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. He was entrusted with his second <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> legation by <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a>. Leaving <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, which was at that time the residence of the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>, he set out on 8 March, 1306, for the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> with the commission to make peace between the parties which were everywhere at variance, and to bring back the various states of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> to their allegiance to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. This mission occupied more than three years, terminating on 12 June, 1309. Cardinal Napoleone played an important part during the political disturbances of the time. At first an opponent of the Colonna and their ambitions, he later became a promoter of French policy and entered into close relations with the French rulers. At the election of <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a> and <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> he exercised a decisive influence, but subsequently became an enemy of the latter. He upheld the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Spirituals, and espoused the cause of King Louis of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> against the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. A <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> for fifty-four years, he took part in the election of seven <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> (<a href="03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> to <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>), on at least three of whom he placed the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a>. He is also known as an author, having written a biography of <a href="04006a.htm">St. Clare of Montefalco</a>.</p>

<p>(3) GIAN GAETANO ORSINI, prothonotary Apostolic, raised to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> by <a href="08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> in December, 1316; d. 1339 (or, according to some sources, 27 August, 1335). In 1326 he was sent to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for certain lands belonging to the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, and remained there until 1334. He endeavoured, though with little success, to bring back several rebellious states and vassals to their allegiance to the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the obstinate Castruccio of <a href="09405a.htm">Lucca</a> and Bishop Guido Tarlato of <a href="01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, as both supported the Visconti of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> in their conflict against the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and, after the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of King Louis the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1327, placed that city under an <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>. After the departure of the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> emperor, the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> entered <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the army of King Robert of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, whereupon the people once more agreed to recognize the suzerainty of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, however, refused to sanction the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> undertaken by the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> against the Colonna, and ordered him to return to <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. In November, 1328, he opened a campaign against the cities of <a href="03798b.htm">Corneto</a> and <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, which submitted to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the following year. The years between 1334 and his death he passed in <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>.</p>

<p>(4) MATTEO ORSINI, d. probably on 18 August, 1340. He entered the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, completed the full course of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, obtained the Degree of Master, and taught <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He won great distinction by his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the spread of the order, and was appointed <a href="12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the Roman province in 1322. In this capacity he became a member of the embassy deputed by the Romans to invite <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> to transfer his residence to the <a href="13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>. On 20 October, 1326, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> named him <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06570d.htm">Girgenti</a> (Sicily), but shortly after (15 June, 1327) transferred him to the archiepiscopal See of Liponto (Manfredonia, Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>), made him <a href="03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of S. Giovanni e Paolo on 18 December, 1327, and <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Sabina on 18 December, 1338. He continued in various ways to promote the welfare of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, richly endowing the Convent of St. Dominic in Bologna.</p>

<p>(5) GIACOMO ORSINI, created <a href="03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a> by <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> on 30 May, 1371, d. at Vicovaro or at Tagliacozzo, 1379. He was distinguished for his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. Appointed <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> in 1376, he was a strong supporter of <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>. In the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1378, he espoused the cause of <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, but later attached himself to the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>.</p>

<p>(6) PONCELLO ORSINI, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02151a.htm">Aversa</a> (Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>) from 19 June, 1370, d. 2 February, 1395. He was created <a href="03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> with the title of St. Clement at the great consistory convoked by <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> on 28 September, 1378. He became <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, and at first worked <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the interests of <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> after the outbreak of the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Later, however, repelled by the impetuous procedure of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, he secretly left the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> and took up his abode upon his own possessions. At the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1389, he was a candidate for the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, appointed him to important <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices, and he exercised great influence upon the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> until his death.</p>

<p>(7) TOMMASO, of the line of the Counts of Manupello, raised to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> (1381) by <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>; d. 10 July, 1390. He was sent by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to the Patrimony of the Marches, where Prince Rinaldo Orsini of <a href="01661a.htm">Aquila</a> and Tagliacozzo had seized the cities of <a href="15221b.htm">Urbino</a> and <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> in addition to other territory. The <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> declared <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against him and won back for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the cities of <a href="10704a.htm">Narni</a>, Ameli, <a href="10704a.htm">Terni</a>, and later also <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. His conduct towards the Papal Vicar of <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> brought upon himself the disfavour of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> him in the fortress of <a href="01406c.htm">Amelia</a>, but later granted him his liberty. On the occasion of the conspiracy of several of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> against <a href="15216a.htm">Urban</a>, Cardinal Orsini remained loyal to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. His relations were intimate with <a href="15216a.htm">Urban's</a> successor, <a href="02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, during whose pontificate he died.</p>

<p>(8) GIORDANO ORSINI, a very distinguished <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> in the <a href="03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> in the first three decades of the fifteenth century, d. at Petricoli, 29 July, 1438. After a thorough and comprehensive training, he became Auditor of the <a href="13205c.htm">Rota</a>, and in February, 1400, was raised by <a href="02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> to the Archiepiscopal See of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>. On 12 June, 1405, <a href="08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a> made him a member of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>, at first with the title of St. Martino of Monti, and later with that of S. Lorenzo in Damaso. In 1412 he was appointed <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="01255b.htm">Albano</a>, and in 1431 <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Sabina. He participated in the election of <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> (1406), but later, with several other <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, renounced allegiance to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, against whom he published a tract. He assisted at the <a href="12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a>, and took part in the election of the Pisan <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> (1409), and of his successor <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> (Balthasar Cossa). The latter sent him as envoy to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, later appointing him <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to the Marches, in which position he was equally distinguished for his ability and <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a>. He assisted <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> at the <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, and took part in the election of <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1417). He was sent by this <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, in company with Cardinal Filastre, to make peace between the two countries. He was also selected for the difficult embassy to <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and the neighboring countries (1426), where he was to combat the Hussite <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. On this occasion he took with him as his secretary the future <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a>. Upon his return, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> entrusted to him another difficult task, namely the visitation and reform of the churches and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1431 <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. A close friendship existed between him and <a href="06564b.htm">Giordano</a>, and the latter supported him loyally and energetically during all the trying conditions of the time. With two other <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="06564b.htm">Giordano</a> was commissioned to proceed against the usurpers of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> possessions in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, after which he was delegated by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to attend the Council of Basle, where he exerted every effort to uphold the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> against the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> element in the council. We are indebted to him for a diary of this council. Later, as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, he journeyed with Cardinal Conti to <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> to meet Emperor Sigismund on his way to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to receive the imperial crown. A man of wide culture, <a href="06564b.htm">Giordano</a> took an active part in the literary life of his time. Numerous and valuable <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were the result of his journeyings as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>, and these he willed to St. Peter's in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (cf. the catalogue of <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in Cancellieri, "De secretariis basilic&aelig; Vatican&aelig;", II, Rome, 1786, pp. 906-14). An Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was founded by him in Bracciano. He died dean of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>, and was buried in St. Peter's in a <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> founded and richly endowed by him.</p>

<p>(9) LATINO ORSINI, likewise of the Roman branch of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and the owner of rich possessions, b. 1411; d. 11 August, 1477. He entered the ranks of the Roman <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> as a youth, became <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and as early as 10 March, 1438, was raised to the Episcopal See of <a href="04350a.htm">Conza</a> in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Transferred from this see to that of <a href="15016d.htm">Trani</a> (Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>) on 8 June, 1439, he remained <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the latter after his elevation to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> by <a href="11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> on 20 December, 1448. On 4 December, 1454, the Archbishopric of <a href="02295a.htm">Bari</a> was conferred upon him, which made it possible for him to take up his residence in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="15016d.htm">See of Trani</a> being given to his brother, John Orsini, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="05785d.htm">Farfa</a>. <a href="11578a.htm">Paul II</a> appointed him <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> for the Marches. <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, for whose election in 1471 Cardinal Latino had worked energetically, named him camerlengo of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>, granted him in 1472 the Archdiocese of <a href="14450d.htm">Taranto</a>, which he governed by proxy, and, in addition, placed him at the head of the government of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. He was also appointed commander-in-chief of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> fleet in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and, acting for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> Ferdinand King of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>. He founded in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Salvatore in Lauro, which he richly endowed and in which he established the canons regular, donating to it also numerous <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In the last years of his life he became deeply religious, though he had been worldly in his youth, leaving a natural son named Paul, whom, with the consent of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, he made heir of his vast possessions.</p>

<p>(10) GIAMBATTISTA ORSINI, nephew of Latino, d. 22 Feb., 1503. He entered the service of the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> at an early age, became cameral cleric, canon of St. Peter's, and was elevated to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> by <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> in 1483. <a href="08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> conferred upon him in 1491 the Archiepiscopal <a href="14450d.htm">See of Taranto</a>, which he governed by proxy, and, as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for Romagna, the Marches, and Bologna, he was entrusted with the administration of these provinces of the Ecclesiastical States. In the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1492, the election of <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> was almost entirely due to him. However, Cardinal Giambattista, together with the head of the House of Orsini, the Duke of Bracciano, having espoused the cause of the Florentines and the French in the <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, was taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in the Vatican at the command of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and thrown into the dungeon of the Castel Sant' Angelo, where he died. The report was current that he had been poisoned by <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>. Other <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Orsini who are worthy of mention because of the active part taken by them either as administrators of the <a href="14257a.htm">papal states</a> or as <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> in other lands are the following:</p>

<p>(11) FLAVIO ORSINI, flourished in the sixteenth century, d. 16 May, 1581. He was created a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1565, having been a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> since 1560, first of the See of Muro and later that of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. In 1572 he was sent by <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to Charles IX of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, principally to support this monarch in his conflict with the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>.</p>

<p>(12) ALESSANDRO ORSINI, belonging to the ducal <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Bracciano, b. 1592; d. 22 August, 1626. He was brought up at the court of the Grand Duke Ferdinand I of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and in 1615 created a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a>. As Legate to <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> under <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, he distinguished himself in 1621 by his great charity on the occasion of the outbreak of a malignant pestilence. Upon his return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he devoted himself to religion and to the practice of an austere asceticism. He even begged permission of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to resign the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> and to enter the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>, but this was refused. Nevertheless, the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> always remained closely united to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. He was a patron of <a href="06342b.htm">Galileo</a>.</p>

<p>(13) VIRGINIO ORSINI, likewise of the ducal <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Bracciano, b. 1615; d. 21 August, 1676. He renounced his birthright in his youth, entered the <a href="10304d.htm">military order</a> of the Knights of Malta, and more than once distinguished himself in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> by his reckless <a href="06147a.htm">bravery</a>. In December, 1641, <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> raised him to the dignity of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and appointed him Protector of the Polish as well as of the Portuguese Orient. He was commissioned to direct the building of the new fortifications with which <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> enclosed the Leonine City and a quarter of Trastevere, and which are still in existence. In 1675 he became <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> of <a href="06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, but died the next year, leaving behind him a reputation of a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a>, gentle, and benevolent prince of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Other distinguished family members</h2>

<p>In addition to the members of the Orsini <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> who were prominent as <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in the history of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, others have gained a place in political history as statesmen, warriors, or patrons of the arts and <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>.</p>

<p>(1) ORSO DI BOBONE, nephew of <a href="03478b.htm">Pope Celestine III</a> (1191-8) and the first Orsini to hold a conspicuous place in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Under the protection of his uncle, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, he was destined to have the principal part in laying the foundation of the dominion, power, and prestige of the Roman Orsini.</p>

<p>His grandchild, (2) MATTEO ROSSO ORSINI, was made senator of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a> in 1241. In this capacity he took a decided stand against the ventures of <a href="06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He was a patron of religious undertakings, a personal friend of <a href="06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, and a member of that saint's <a href="14637b.htm">Third Order</a>. While one of the sons of Matteo Rosso, Gian Gaetano, ascended the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, another, (3) RINALDO, continued the activities of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> in the political field, exerting himself to the utmost to prevent the alliance of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the Hohenstaufen Konradin.</p>

<p>A son of this Rinaldo, (4) MATTEO ORSINI, was twice senator in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His wise and energetic uncle, <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, to show that <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> rule was once more dominant in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, deprived King Charles of Anjou of the senatorial dignity, and in 1278 published the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> that thenceforth no foreign emperor or king could become a senator, a Roman being alone eligible for the dignity, and then only with the consent of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and for one year. The power of the Orsini was in general much strengthened by this capable <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> of their race.</p>

<p>In the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the following were particularly famous as military leaders in the numberless internal <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; (5) PAOLO ORSINI, who in the beginning of the fifteenth century fought as <em>condottiere</em> in the service of several <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, was taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by Ladislas of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, again set at liberty, and fell in battle against Braccio da Montone before <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a> on 5 July, 1416.</p>

<p>(6) VIRGINIO ORSINO, Lord of Bracciano, was leader of the forces of <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> (1471-84) in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and victor at the battle of Campo Morto against the Neapolitans (1482). Later, however, he entered the service of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> to oppose King Charles VIII of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (1483-98); in 1494, however, he took the side of the latter, and was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> on this account. He died on 18 January, 1497, in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>.</p>

<p>(7) NICCOLO ORSINI, Count of Petigliano, was, at this time, in the service of the Anjous, military leader in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>, <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Later, however, he went over with his army to the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> standard, and became general-in-chief of the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Republic in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the League of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. He captured Padua, but was defeated in 1509, and died the following year.</p>

<p>Of the members of the Orsini <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> who flourished during the sixteenth century (8) PAOLO GIORDANO ORSINI is also worthy of mention. Born in 1541, he was created a duke, with the title of Bracciano, by <a href="12129a.htm">Pope Pius IV</a> (1560). Under <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, he was general of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> troops in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> (1566). His first wife, Isabella Medici, being <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>, he took as his second wife Vittoria Accoramboni, <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of the <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> Francesco Peretti, a nephew of <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. Accused of murdering the latter, Paolo Giordano was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He died at Salo in 1585.</p>

<p>(9) FULVIO ORSINI was distinguished as a <a href="07538b.htm">humanist</a>, historian, and <a href="01688a.htm">archeologist</a>, b. on 11 December, 1529; d. in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 May, 1600. He was the natural son probably of Maerbale Orsini of the line of Mugnano. Cast off by his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> at the age of nine, he found a refuge among the choir boys of St. John Lateran, and a protector in Canon <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> Delfini. He applied himself energetically to the study of the ancient languages, published a new edition of Arnobius (Rome, 1583) and of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> (Rome, 1587), and wrote works dealing with the history of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> &#151; "Famili&aelig; Roman&aelig; ex antiquis numismatibus" (Rome, 1577), "Fragmenta historicorum" (Antwerp, 1595), etc. He brought together a large collection of antiquities, and built up a costly <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and books, which later became part of the Vatican <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> (cf. de Nolhac, "La biblioth&egrave;que de Fulvio Orsini", Paris, 1887). A <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> of the Orsini <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> likewise played an important political role in the seventeenth century: MARIE ANNE, <em>n&eacute;e</em> de la Tr&eacute;moille, b. 1642. Her first husband was Talleyrand, Prince de Chalais, after whose death she married Flavio Orsini, Duke of Bracciano, who remained loyal to <a href="08021a.htm">Pope Innocent XI</a> in his difficulties with <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV of France</a>. Marie Anne used her influence with the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> in the interests of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and in 1701, after the death of her husband, went to <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a> as mistress of the robes to Queen Marie-Louise, who, together with her husband Philip V of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, was completely under her influence. She did much to strengthen the throne of these rulers, but, nevertheless, in 1714 when Philip married Elizabeth Farnese, she was dismissed with ingratitude and returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where she died on 5 December, 1722 (see Hill, "The Princess Orsini", London, 1899). The ancient <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the Roman Orsini is extinct. The present princes of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> descend from the <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> line, which may be traced back to Francesco Orsini, Count of <a href="15016d.htm">Trani</a> and <a href="04346a.htm">Conversano</a>. In 1463 they became Dukes of <a href="06733c.htm">Gravina</a>, later (1724) princes of the Empire and Roman princes. The head of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> always enjoys the dignity of assistant at the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. The present head is Filippo Orsini-Gravina-Sarzina, b. 10 December, 1842. Several noble <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> outside of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> trace back their descent to the ancient Italian Orsini, as for example the Juvenels des Ursins in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the Rosenbergs in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>.</p>
