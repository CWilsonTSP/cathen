<p>Countess of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, daughter and heiress of the Marquess Boniface of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and Beatrice, daughter of Frederick of Lorraine, b. 1046; d. 24 July, 1114. In 1053 her father was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>. Duke Gottfried of Lorraine, an opponent of the <a href="07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a>, went to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and married the <a href="15617c.htm">widowed</a> Beatrice. But, in 1055, when Henry III entered <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> he took Beatrice and her daughter Matilda <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a> and had them brought to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Thus the young countess was early dragged into the bustle of these troublous times. That, however, did not prevent her receiving an excellent training; she was finely <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a>, <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> Latin, and was very fond of serious books. She was also deeply religious, and even in her youth followed with interest the great <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions which were then prominent. Before his death in 1056 Henry III gave back to Gottfried of Lorraine his wife and stepdaughter. When Matilda grew to womanhood she was married to her stepbrother Gottfried of Lower Lorraine, from whom, however, she separated in 1071. He was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> in 1076; the marriage was childless, but it cannot be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that it was never consummated, as many historians asserted. From 1071 Matilda entered upon the government and administration of her extensive possessions in Middle and Upper <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. These domains were of the greatest importance in the political and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> disputes of that time, as the road from <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by way of Upper <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> passed through them. On 22 April, 1071, <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and before long the great battle for the independence of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the reform of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life began. In this contest Matilda was the fearless, <a href="06147a.htm">courageous</a>, and unswerving ally of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and his successors.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Immediately on his elevation to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a> entered into close relations with Matilda and her mother. The letters to Matilda (Beatrice d. 1076) give distinct expression to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> high esteem and sympathy for the princess. He called her and her mother "his sisters and daughters of St. Peter" (Regest., II, ix), and wished to undertake a <a href="04543c.htm">Crusade</a> with them to free the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the Holy Land (Reg., I, xi). Matilda and her mother were present at the Roman Lenten <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of 1074 and 1075, at which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> published the important decrees on the reform of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. Both mother and daughter reported to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> favourably on the disposition of the German king, <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>, and on 7 December, 1074, <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a> wrote to him, thanking him for the friendly reception of the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, and for his intention to co- operate in the uprooting of <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="04207a.htm">concubinage</a> from among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. However, the quarrel between <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> soon began. In a letter to Beatrice and Matilda (11 Sept., 1075) the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> complained of the inconstancy and changeableness of the king, who apparently had no desire to be at peace with him. In the next year (1076) Matilda's first husband, Gottfried of Lorraine, was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a> wrote to Bishop Hermann of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, 25 August, 1076, that he did not yet <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> in which state Matilda "the faithful handmaid of St. Peter" would, under <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> guidance, remain.</p>

<p>On account of the action of the Synod of Worms against <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a> (1076), the latter was compelled to lay <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> under <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. As the majority of the princes of the empire now took sides against the king, Henry wished to be reconciled with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and consequently travelled to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the middle of a severe winter, in order to meet the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> there before the latter should leave Italian soil on his journey to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, who had already arrived in <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> when he heard of the king's journey, betook himself at Matilda's advice to her mountain stronghold of <a href="03298a.htm">Canossa</a> for security. The <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> king had asked the Countess Matilda, his mother- in-law Adelaide, and Abbot Hugh of Cluny, to intercede with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> for him. These fulfilled the king's request, and after long opposition <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a> permitted Henry to appear before him personally at <a href="03298a.htm">Canossa</a> and atone for his guilt by public penance. After the king's departure the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> set out for Mantua. For safety Matilda accompanied him with armed men, but hearing a rumour that <a href="07063a.htm">Archbishop Wibert of Ravenna</a>, who was unfriendly to <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, was preparing an ambush for him, she brought the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> back to Canossa. Here she drew up a first deed of gift, in which she bequeathed her domains and estates from Ceperano to Radicofani to the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. But as long as she lived she continued to govern and administer them freely and independently. When, soon after, Henry again renewed the contest with <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, Matilda constantly supported the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> with soldiers and money. On her security the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="03298a.htm">Canossa</a> had its treasure melted down, and sent <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a> seven hundred pounds of silver and nine pounds of gold as a contribution to the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against Henry. The latter withdrew from the Romagna to <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> in 1082, and laid waste Matilda's lands in his march through <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. Nevertheless the countess did not desist from her adherence to <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a>. She was confirmed in this by her confessor, Anselm, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09405a.htm">Lucca</a>.</p>

<p>In similar ways she supported the successors of the great <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the contest for the freedom of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. When in 1087, shortly after his <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>, <a href="15410a.htm">Pope Victor III</a> was driven from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="07063a.htm">Wibert</a>, Matilda advanced to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with an army, occupied the Castle of Sant'Angelo and part of the city, and called Victor back. However, at the threats of the emperor the Romans again deserted Victor, so that he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee once more. At the wish of <a href="15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a> Matilda married in 1089 the young Duke Welf of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, in order that the most faithful defender of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> chair might thus obtain a powerful ally. In 1090 <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> returned to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> to attack Matilda, whom he had already deprived of her estates in <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>. He laid waste many of her possessions, conquered Mantua, her principal stronghold, by treachery in 1091, as well as several castles. Although the vassals of the countess hastened to make their peace with the emperor, Matilda again promised fidelity to the cause of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and continued the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, which now took a turn in her favour. Henry's army was defeated before Canossa. Welf, Duke of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and his son of the same name, Matilda's husband, went over to Henry in 1095, but the countess remained steadfast. When the new German king, Henry V, entered <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the autumn of 1110, Matilda did homage to him for the imperial fiefs. On his return he stopped three days with Matilda in <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, showed her every mark of respect, and made her imperial vice-regent of Liguria. In 1112, she reconfirmed the donation of her <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> that she had made in 1077 (Mon. Germ. Hist.: Legum, IV, i, 653 sqq.). After her death Henry went to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1116, and took her lands &#151; not merely the imperial fiefs, but also the freeholds. The <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, though, put forward its legitimate claim to the inheritance. A lengthy dispute now issued over the possession of the dominions of Matilda, which was settled by a compromise between <a href="08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> and Lothair III in 1133. The emperor and Duke Henry of Saxony took Matilda's freeholds as fiefs from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at a yearly rent of 100 pounds of silver. The duke took the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; after his death Matilda's possessions were to be restored wholly to the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Afterwards there were again disputes about these lands, and in agreements between the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and emperors of the twelfth century this matter is often mentioned. In 1213 the <a href="06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> recognized the right of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> to the possessions of Matilda.</p>
