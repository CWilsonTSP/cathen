<p><a href="10285c.htm">Medieval</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and <a href="14621a.htm">mystical</a> writer; b. 1096, at the manor of Hartingham in Saxony; d. 11 March, 1141. The works of Derling and of Hugonin leave no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> was mistaken in declaring his birthplace to be Ypres in <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. He was the eldest son of Conrad, Count of Blankenburg. His uncle, Reinhard who had studied in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> under <a href="15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a>, had on his return to Saxony been made <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Halberstadt. It was in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Pancras, at Hamerleve near Halberstadt, that Hugh received his <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. In spite of the opposition of his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, he took the habit of the <a href="03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> at Hamerleve; before his <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was completed, the disturbed state of the country led his uncle to advise him to go to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Victor in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he arrived about 1115. <a href="15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a>, its founder, on his election to the See of Ch&#226;lons, in 1112, had been succeeded by Gilduin, under whom it lost none of its reputation for <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. Under his rule and guidance Hugh spent the rest of his life, studying, teaching, and writing. On the tragic death of Thomas (20 Aug., 1133) Hugh was chosen to succeed him as head of the School of St. Victor, and under his direction it attained to brilliant success. He is sometimes spoken of as <em>alter Augustinus,</em> because of his familiarity with the works of the great <a href="02084a.htm">Father of the Church</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>His own works cover the whole range of the arts and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a> taught in his day. Until a few years ago, however, most historians of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> put him down as a narrow-minded mystic out of touch with the world of thought and study, who hampered rather than helped scientific progress, and whose fantastic symbolism misled subsequent generations. A careful examination of his works has led to a truer appreciation of one whom Harnack (History of Dogma, tr. London, 1899, VI, 44) terms "the most influential <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the twelfth century". A great <a href="14621a.htm">mystical</a> writer, he was also a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and a scholastic <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the first order. Primarily, he was a great lecturer, and that fact accounts for the early dispersal of his works as his hearers dispersed, their frequent incorporation in later treatises, and the publication under his name of so many unauthentic treatises. His teaching was one of the foundations of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic theology</a>, and his influence has affected the whole development of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, for he was the first who after synthesizing the dogmatic treasures of the patristic age systematized them and formed them into a coherent and complete body of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. That was the work of a genius. But his great merit as head of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Victor is that, when the <a href="07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> and <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> temerity of <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a> endangered the new method which was being applied to the study of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Hugh and his followers, by their prudent moderation and unimpeachable <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, reassured alarmed believers and acclimatized the new scientific method in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</p>

<p>The work of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> classification made great progress in the time of <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, and in the "Summ&aelig;" were condensed encyclopedic summaries of the whole of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> "Sic et Non" traced the lines upon which the "Summ&aelig;" were built up; but they reproduced the drawbacks of the parent work in that the difficulties stated in the pros and cons were frequently left unsolved. The introduction of more strictly <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> processes culminated in the fusion of patristic erudition and rational speculation in the new constructive <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> method. After the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> had been established by the interpretation of the Scriptures and the Fathers, the assistance of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was sought to show the rational character of the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>. That application of dialectics to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> led <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a> into <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the twelfth century were deeply divided as to its legitimacy. It was defended by the <a href="01036b.htm">Abelardian</a> and Victorian Schools, and from them is descended what is properly known as <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic theology</a>. The <a href="01036b.htm">Abelardian</a> School of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> continued to exist even after its founder's condemnation in 1141, but was influenced by the Victorian School, which in turn felt the influence of the <a href="01036b.htm">Abelardian</a> School, but kept well within the limits of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Thus both contributed to the triumph of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>.</p>

<p>Any attempted synthesis of Hugh's teaching should be preceded by a critical examination of the authenticity of the treatises which have been included in the collected edition of his works, and some of the most authoritative historians of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> have gone astray through non-observance of this elementary precaution. Others again have concentrated their attention on his writings on <a href="14621a.htm">mystical theology</a>, where the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> reigns supreme&#175;to attempt to appreciate an author's <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> teaching upon data furnished by his endeavours to explain what passes in the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> possessed of perfect charity can only lead to confusion. Hugh has left us sufficient material, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, in which rational explanations stand side by side with revealed teaching, to enable us to form a sound opinion of his position as a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, and a mystic.</p>

<p><em>As a Philosopher,</em> he has a clear <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, frequently emphasized, of the subject-matter of a purely rational <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, different from <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>; and the two orders of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are as clearly differentiated in his writings as in those of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. By philosophy he meant the whole range of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> attained by natural reason. The assigning of a definite place to philosophy in the plan of studies was the result of a long and gradual process; but its place above the liberal arts and below <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> is clearly defined by Hugh in the "Eruditionis Didascali&aelig;". Abandoning the old outgrown framework, Hugh sets forth a new division of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: "Philosophia dividitur in theoreticam, practicam, mechanicam et logicam. Haec quatuor omnem continent scientiam."&#175;"Philosophy is divided into theoretical, practical, mechanical, and <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a>. These four [divisions] comprise all <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."&#175;(Erud. Didasc., II, 2). This new division of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> into speculative <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, concerned with the nature and <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of things, ethics, the products of man's activity, thoughts and words, is well and <a href="09324a.htm">logically</a> thought out. The whole of his exposition of what is meant by <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, its object, divisions, and the order in which they ought to be dealt with, is a study unique in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> before the second half of the twelfth century, and had Hugh never written more than the early books of the "Didascali&aelig;", he would still deserve a place among the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. It is interesting to note that, although the question of <a href="15182a.htm">universals</a> in his day filled the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and at St. Victor's <a href="15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a> had many faithful followers, Hugh systematically avoids the whole question, although in places he rejects some of the principal arguments put forward by the Realists. The markedly <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> trend of the whole of his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system has recently been the subject of careful study by Ostler. Hugh's teaching concerning <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has been fully analysed by Kilgenstein, and gives us the key to the whole of his teaching: by the use of reason man can and must arrive at the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>: <em>aseitas,</em> pure-spirituality, absolute simplicity, <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>, immensity, immutability of being and of action&#175;such are the conceptions he discovers in his Maker, and which furnish him with a synthetic and well-reasoned <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Divine essence. At the same time he maintains the moral necessity of revelation, so that the teaching of St. Thomas, as set forth in the early chapters of the "Contra Gentiles", adds nothing to Hugh. It is interesting to note that, following St. Anselm's "Monologium", he takes the human <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> as the first element of observation as to the contingence of nature, and thence rises to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. (See P.L., CLXXVI, 824.)</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><em>As a Theologian.</em>&#175;His valuable work as a sound thinker has already been mentioned; he had a keen appreciation of the merits of much of <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> work and always cites him with respect; at the same time he combated his <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>. Thus, when <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, in treating of creation, had replaced the freedom and <a href="11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by a most exaggerated Optimism, Hugh attacked the <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> in his "De Sacr.", Bk. I, P. II, c. xxii. His <a href="14597a.htm">Christological</a> teaching is marked by a semi-Apollinarist <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> in attributing to the humanity of Christ not only the uncreated <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Word, but <a href="11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> and other <a href="02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>. But he vigorously combats <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> conceptions of the <a href="07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> which led to a revival of <a href="01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a> that troubled the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> until its condemnation 18 Feb., 1177, by <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1164-77). Hugh's sacramental teaching is of great importance in that he begins the final stage in the formulation of the definition of a sacrament; synthesizing the scattered teaching of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, he set aside the Isidorian definition and gave a truer and more comprehensive one, which, when perfected by the author of the "Summa Sententiarum", was adopted in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. His works contain an extensive body of moral <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> based upon a solid patristic basis, in the grouping of which the influence of <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a> is visible; but in his accurate analysis of the nature of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, he combats <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> as to the indifferent character of all acts in themselves apart from the will of the doer. At the same time he held an <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> view as to the reviviscence, after a fall, of previously pardoned mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> (De Sacr., Bk. II, P. XIV, c. viii).</p>

<p><em>As a Mystic.</em>&#175;Historians of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are now coming to see that it betrays a lack of <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> to be unable to figure the subjective coexistence of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> dialectics with <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> of the Victorine or <a href="02498d.htm">Bernardine</a> type&#175;and even their compenetration. Speculative thought was not, and could not be, isolated from <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> lived with such intensity as it was in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, when that speculative thought was active everywhere, in every profession, in every degree of the social scale.&#175;After all, did not the same mind give us the two "Summ&aelig;" and the Office of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>?&#175;Hugh of St. Victor was the leader of the great mystical movement of which the School of St. Victor became the centre, and he formulated, as it were, a code of the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> governing the <a href="14153a.htm">soul's</a> progress to union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. The gist of his teaching is that mere <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not an end in itself, it ought to be but the stepping-stone to the mystical life&#175;through thought, meditation, and contemplation; thought seeks <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in the material world, meditation discovers Him within ourselves, contemplation knows Him supernaturally and <a href="08082b.htm">intuitively</a>. Such are the "three eyes" of the rational <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hugh's mystical teaching was amplified by <a href="13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a>, whose proud disdain for philosophy has been wrongly attributed to Hugh.</p>

<p>Hugh's chief works are:&#175;</p>

<p>(1) "De Sacramentis Christian&aelig; Fidei" (c. 1134), his masterpiece and most extensive work, a dogmatic synthesis similar to, but more perfect than the "Introductio ad Theologiam" of <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a> (c. 1118), which was only concerned with the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and of the Trinity. It is of a more literary character: in it the first place belongs to the argument from authority, but the utilization of the <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> method binds the discussion together. It is at once a summary and a corrected version of his earlier works. The work is divided into two books comprising twelve and eighteen parts respectively each containing numerous chapters. The following analysis of its contents will convey some <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of its range: Book I: 1. The Creation; 2. The end of man's creation; 3. The <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="15047a.htm">Triune God</a>; 4. The will of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and its signs; 5. <a href="01476d.htm">Angels</a>; 6 Man before the Fall; 7. The Fall and its consequences; 8. The restoration of man and the use of <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; 9. The <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in general; 10. Faith; 11. The <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in particular and primarily those of the <a href="09076a.htm">natural law</a>; 12. Sacraments of the written law. Book II: 1. Incarnation of the Word; 2. Grace and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; 3. The orders of the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>; 4. A mystical explanation of the <a href="15388a.htm">sacred vestments</a>; 5. Dedication of churches (in which the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are conferred); 6. Baptism; 7. Confirmation; 8. <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>; 9. The lesser <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> (<a href="13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>); 10. <a href="14001a.htm">Simony</a>; 11. Matrimony; 12. Vows; 13. Virtues and vices; 14. Confession and <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>; 15. Extreme unction; 16. The state of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> after death; 17. <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> second coming and the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>; 18. The state of things to come.&#175;It is the first complete <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> work of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</p>

<p>(2) "Eruditionis Didascali&aelig;, libri septem" comprises what we should now speak of as encyclopedics, methodology, introduction to <a href="../bible.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, and an indication of how we may rise from things visible to a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Trinity.</p>

<p>(3) Scriptural commentaries (important both for his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and mystical doctrines): "Adnotationes Elucidatori&aelig; in Pentateuchon"; "In librum Judicum"; "In libros Regum" (notes on the literal meaning of the texts); "In Salomonis Ecclesiasten Homili&aelig; xix" (practical rather than <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a>); "Adnotationes Elucidatori&aelig; in Threnos Jeremi&aelig; in Joelem prophetam" (working out the literal, allegorical, and moral meanings); "Explanatio in Canticum Beat&aelig; Mari&aelig;" (allegorical and tropological). The "Qu&aelig;stiones et Decisiones in Epistolas S. Pauli", printed among his works in <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, are certainly posterior to Hugh.</p>

<p>(4) "Commentariorum in Hierarchiam C&aelig;lestem S. Dionysii Areopagit&aelig; secundum interpretationem Joannis Scoti libri x."</p>

<p>(5) His chief mystical works are: "De Arc&#226; Noah Morali et Mystic&#226;" "De Vanitate Mundi"; "De Arrh&#226; Anim&aelig;"; "De Contemplatione et eius speciebus" (first published by Haur&eacute;au as an appendix to his book in 1859).</p>

<p>(6) As regards the "Summa Sententiarum", usually ascribed to Hugh of St. Victor, considerable discussion has recently taken place. Haur&eacute;au, Mignon, Gietl, Kilgenstein, <a href="02241a.htm">Baltus</a>, Ostler attribute it to Hugh. <a href="04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, arguing from the anonymity of the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, left the question open. But Portali&eacute;, basing his argument upon important <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> differences, appears to have shown that it is not the work of Hugh, although it belongs to his <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. The general line of his argument is that the "Summa Sententiarum" is certainly posterior to the "De Sacramentis", upon which it frequently draws; doctrines, methods, and formul&aelig; show evident progress in the "Summa". It would seem that it is absolutely impossible that Hugh should have written the "Summa" after the "De Sacramentis", for the "Summa" borrows from the <a href="01036b.htm">Abelardian</a> School <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> Hugh would not have taught, and even <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> and formul&aelig; which he expressly attacked. De Wulf agrees with this, and Pourrat has brought additional evidence, based upon an examination of the sacramental teaching of the two works, in support of the same thesis. None of the writers cited above, as being in favour of Hugh's authorship, have dealt with Portali&eacute;'s evidence.</p>

<p>The best edition of the works of Hugh of St. Victor is that of the Canons of St. Victor, printed at <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> in 1648. It is not a critical edition, however, and genuine, spurious, and <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> works are found side by side. It was republished in 1854, with slight modifications, by the Abb&eacute; <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a> in P.L., CLXXV-CLXXVII, but it is neither complete nor critically satisfactory, and should be used in conjunction with J.-B. Haur&eacute;au;'s ":Hugues de St-Victor et l'edition de ses &oelig;uvres" (Paris, 1859) and the same writer's "Les &OElig;uvres de Hugues de Saint-Victor: Essai Critique" (Paris, 1886), in which he supplements and corrects many of the conclusions of the earlier work. But Haur&eacute;au's <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> bias renders his exposition of Hugh's <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> unreliable, without careful checking.</p>
