<p>Athos is a small tongue of land that projects into the Aegean Sea, being the eastern-most of the three strips in which the great mountainous peninsula of Chalcidice ends. It is almost cut off from the mainland, to which it is bound only by a narrow isthmus dotted with lakes and swamps interspersed with alluvial plains. It has been well called "a Greece in miniature", because of the varied contour of its coasts, deep bays and inlets, bold cliffs and promontories, steep wooded slopes, and valleys winding inland. Several cities existed here in pre-Christian antiquity, and a sanctuary of Zeus (Jupiter) is said to have stood on the mountain. The isthmus was famous for the canal (3,950 feet in length) which Xerxes had dug across it, in order to avoid the perilous turning of the limestone peak immemorially known as Mount Athos, in which the small peninsula ends, and which rises to a height of some 6,000 feet. From the summit of this peak on a clear day are visible the coasts of <a href="12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> and Thrace, even the entire Aegean from Mount Olympus in Thessaly to Mount Ida in <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. It is the mountain that the architect Dinocrates offered to turn into a <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of Alexander the Great with a city in one hand and in the other a perennially flowing spring. <a href="10285c.htm">Medieval</a> Greek tradition designated it as the "high mountain" from which <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a> tempted <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. Its chief modern interest lies in the fact that at least from the beginning of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it has been the home of a little monastic republic that still retains almost the same autonomy granted a thousand years ago by the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors of Constantinople. In 1905 the many fortified <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and hermitages of Athos contained 7,553 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> (including their numerous male dependents), members of the Orthodox <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>: Greeks, 3,207; Russians, 3,615; <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, 340; Rumanians, 288; Georgians, 53; <a href="13732a.htm">Servians</a>, 18; other nationalities 32. The principal <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> bear the following names: Laura, Iviron, Vatopedi, Chilandarion, St. Dionysius, Coutloumousi, Pantocrator, Xiropotamos, Zographu, Docheiarion, Caracalla, Philotheos, Simopetra, St. Paul, Stauroniceta, Xenophon, Gregorios, Esphigmenon, St. Panteleimon, St. Anna (Rossicon), and Karyses.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The origins of monastic life on Mount Athos are obscure. It is probable that individual <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> sought its lonely recesses during the fourth and fifth centuries, and were numerous in the ninth century at the time of the first certain attempts at monastic organization. The nearest <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was that of Hierissus, and in conformity with ancient law and usage its <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> claimed <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of the little peninsula. In 885 Emperor Basil the Macedonian emancipated them from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Colobos near Hierissus, and allotted to them Mount Athos as their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. Soon after, the oldest of the principal <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, Xiropotamos, was built and adopted the <a href="02322a.htm">rule of St. Basil</a>. <a href="10424a.htm">Saracen</a> pirates disturbed the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in the ninth and tenth centuries, but imperial generosity always came to the aid of this domestic "holy land" of the Greeks. About 960 a far-reaching reform was introduced by the Anatolian <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> of <a href="15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, later known as Athonites. With several companions from <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> he founded by the seashore the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> since known as Laura, where he raised the monastic life to a high degree of perfection. Eventually the new settlement was accepted as a model. With the help of the imperial authority of John Tzimisces (969-976) all opposition was set aside and the cenobitic or community life imposed on the <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> scattered in the valleys and forests. <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> was made <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> general or superior (<em>Protos</em>) of the fifty-eight monastic communities then on the mountain. From this period date the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> known as Iviron (Iberians), Vatopedi, and Esphigmenon. At this time, also, there arose a <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a> of internal conflict that has never been removed. Hitherto only one nationality, the Greek, was represented among the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. Henceforth, <a href="14042a.htm">Slavic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and generosity, and later on <a href="14042a.htm">Slavic</a> interests, had to be considered. The newly converted <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a> sought and obtained admission into the recently opened <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; before long their princes in the Balkan Peninsula began to found independent houses for <a href="14042a.htm">Slavic</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. In this way arose during the reign of Alexius I (1081-1118) the strictly <a href="14042a.htm">Slavic</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Chilandarion and Zographu. The Byzantine emperors never ceased to manifest their interest in the little monastic republic and even profited politically by the universal esteem that the religious brotherhood enjoyed throughout the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>.</p>

<p>With the aid of the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, in 1046, Constantine Monomachos regulated the domestic government of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> the administration of their temporal possessions, and their commercial activity. By the imperial document (<em>typicon</em>) which he issued, <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> are forbidden the peninsula, a prohibition so strictly observed since that time that even the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <em>aga,</em> or official, who resides at Karyaes (Cariez) may not take his harem with him. About the year 1100 the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Mount Athos were 180 in number, and sheltered 700 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, with their dependents. At this time there came into general use the term <em>Hagion Oros</em> (Holy Mountain, <em>hagion oros, Monte Santo</em>). Alexius I granted the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> immunity from taxation, freed them from all subjection to the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and placed them under his immediate protection. They still depended, however, on the neighboring <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hierissus for the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> of their <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>. Alexius also chose to be buried on the Holy Mountain among the brethren (1118). A century later, after the capture of Constantinople (1204), the Latin <a href="04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> abused the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, who thereupon appealed to <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>; he took them under his protection and in his letters (xiii, 40; xvi, 168) paid a tribute to their monastic virtues. However, with the restoration of Greek political supremacy the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> returned (1313) to their old allegiance to Constantinople.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the fourteenth century a pseudo-spiritualism akin to that of the ancient Euchites or <a href="10212a.htm">Messalians</a>, culminating in the famous <a href="07301a.htm">Hesychast</a> controversies (see <a href="07301a.htm">HESYCHASM</a>; PALAMAS), greatly disturbed the mutual harmony of Greek <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, especially those of Mount Athos, one of whose <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, Callistus, had become <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (1350-54) and in that office exhibited great severity towards the opponents of <a href="07301a.htm">Hesychasm</a>. Racial and national discord between the Greeks and the <a href="13732a.htm">Servians</a> added fuel to the flames, and for a while the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were again subjected to the immediate supervision of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hierissus. In the meantime the Palaeologi emperors at Constantinople and the <a href="14042a.htm">Slav</a> princes and nobles of the Balkan Peninsula continued to enrich the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Mount Athos, which received the greater part of their landed wealth during this period. Occasionally a Byzantine emperor took refuge among the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in the hope of forgetting the cares and responsibilities of his office. Amid the political disasters of the Greeks, during the fourteenth century, Mount Athos appears as a kind of Holy Land, a retreat for many men eminent in <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, and a place where the spirit of Greek patriotism was cherished when threatened elsewhere <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> ruin (Krumbacher, 1058-59). This period was also marked by the attempts of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Karyaes to secure a pre-eminence over the others, the final exclusion of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hierissus from the peninsula, fresh attacks from freebooters of all kinds, and the foundation of several new <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>: Simopetra, Castamonitu, St. Paul and St. Dionysius. The Fall of Constantinople (1453) brought no modification of the conditions on the Holy Mountain. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, who had stubbornly opposed all attempts at reunion with the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, submitted at once to the domination of the Osmanli, and, with rare exceptions, have never been interfered with by the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> authorities. The hospodars of Wallachia remained as ever their friends and benefactors. Though the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> sympathized with the Greeks in the War of Independence (1822-30), their estates on the Greek mainland were secularized by Capo d'Istria and a similar fate has overtaken their properties in the Danubian principal cities. They still hold numerous farms and properties in certain islands of the Archipelago and on the mainland (<a href="08611a.htm">Kaulen</a> in Kirchenlex., I, 1557-59; Bayet in Grande Encycl., s.v. Athos).</p>

<h2>Constitution and government</h2>

<p>This monastic republic is governed by an assembly of 20 members one representative from each of the 20 principal <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; from among these is elected annually, and in due rotation, a committee of 4 presidents. The great seal of the united <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> is in four pieces and is divided among the members of this committee. One of the members is chosen as chairman, or <em>Protos.</em> Meetings of the assembly are held weekly (Saturday), at Karyaes, and the assembly acts as a supreme parliament and tribunal, with appeal, however, to the patriarch at Constantinople.</p>

<p>The <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Government is represented by an agent at Karyaes, the diminutive capital of the peninsula and the landing-place for visitors. A detachment of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> soldiers is usually stationed there, and no one may land without permission of the monastic authorities. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> have also an agent at Saloniki and another at Constantinople. Almost the only source of contention among them is the rivalry between the Greeks, inheritors of old traditions and customs, and the Russians of the great <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rossicon (St. Anna), representative of the wealth, power, and interests of their church and country, and generously supported from St. Petersburg. In its present form the constitution of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> dates from 1783.</p>

<h2>Monastic life</h2>

<p>Each of the twenty great <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (twenty-one, including Karyaes) possesses its own large church and numerous <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> within and without its enclosure, which is strongly fortified, recalling the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> burgs of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The high walls and strong towers are reminders of the troubled times of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries when corsairs abounded and <a href="13691a.htm">self-defense</a> was imperative. All of the great <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are on the Holy Mountain proper, and are most picturesquely situated from sea to summit, amid dense masses of oak, pine, and chestnut, or on inaccessible crags. To each of these <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> is attached a certain number of minor <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (<em>sketai, asceteria</em>), small monastic settlements (<em>kathismata</em>), and hermitages (<em>kellia, cellae</em>). Every monastic habitation must be affiliated to one or the other of the great <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and is subject to its direction or supervision. All <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are dedicated to the <a href="15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, the larger ones under some specially significant title. The ancient Greek <a href="02322a.htm">Rule of St. Basil</a> is still followed by all.</p>

<p>In the observance of the Rule, however, the greater <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are divided into two classes, some following strictly the cenobitic life, while others permit a larger personal freedom. The latter are called "idiorhythmic"; in them the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> have a right of personal ownership and a certain share in the government of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> (Council of Elders); they take their meals apart, and are subject to less severe regulations. In the former, known as "cenobitic" (<em>koinobion</em>, <em>coenobium,</em> common life), there is a greater monastic rigor. The superior, or <em>hegoumenos</em>, has absolute authority, and all <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> is held in common. The chief occupation of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> is that of solemn public <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, by night and by day, i.e. recitation of the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, corresponding to the solemn choir-service of the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. (See <a href="06774a.htm">GREEK RITE</a>, <a href="02768b.htm">BREVIARY</a>, PSALMODY.) This leaves little time for agricultural, industrial, or <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> labor. Some fish, or practice minor industries in aid of the common support, or administer the monastic estates located elsewhere; others go abroad occasionally to collect a part of the yearly tribute (about two dollars and a half) that each <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> must pay to the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Government. A portion of this is collected from the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> themselves; the rest is secured by the revenue of their farms or other possessions, and by contributions from affiliated <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the Balkan Peninsula, <a href="06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, and <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The generosity of the Greek faithful is also a source of revenue, for Mount Athos is one of the most sacred <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> sites of the entire <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, and the feasts of the principal <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are always celebrated with great pomp. It may be added that the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> practice faithfully the monastic virtue of hospitality. The usual name for the individual <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> here, as elsewhere in the Greek Orient, is <em>Kalogeros</em> (good old man). In their dress the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> do not differ from other communities of Greek <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a>.</p>

<h2>Architecture and the arts</h2>

<p>Most of the buildings of Mount Athos are comparatively modern. Yet, because of the well-known conservative character of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, these edifices represent with much fidelity the <a href="03094a.htm">Byzantine architecture</a>, civil and religious, of the tenth to the fourteenth century. The churches are very richly adorned with columns and pavements of marble, frescoed walls and <a href="04569d.htm">cupolas</a>, decorated screens, etc.; there are not many <a href="10584a.htm">mosaics</a>. Some of the smaller <a href="11271a.htm">oratories</a> are said to be the oldest extant specimens of private architecture in the West, apart from the houses of Pompeii. The ecclesiastical art of the Greek Orient is richly represented here, with all its religious respect, though also with all its immobile conservatism and its stern refusal to interpret individual feeling in any other forms than those made sacred by a long line of almost nameless monastic <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a> like Panselinos and confided by his disciples to the famous "Painters' Book of Mount Athos" (see <a href="04783a.htm">Didron</a>, Manuel d'iconographie chr&eacute;tienne, Paris, 1858). Though there is not in the 935 churches of the peninsula any art-work older than the sixteenth century (Bayet) their frescoes, small <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> on boards, gilt and jeweled metal work, represent with almost unswerving accuracy the principles, spirit, and details of <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> Byzantine art as applied to <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> uses.</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>Each <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> possesses its own <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>, and the combined treasures make up a unique collection of ancient <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (Montfaucon, Palaeographia Graeca, Paris, 1748, 441 sqq.). By far the richest in this respect is the Russian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint Anna (Rossicon). Some of the more valuable classical Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> have been purchased or otherwise secured by travelers (Neumann, "Serapeum", X, 252; Duchesne, "M&eacute;moire sur une mission au Mont Athos", Paris, 1876; Lambros, "Catalogue of the Greek Manuscripts on Mount Athos", Cambridge, 1895, 1900). It was in this way that the text of Ptolemy first reached the West. Similarly, the oldest <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the second-century <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> text known as "The Shepherd of Hermas" came from Mount Athos. The <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> now in possession of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> have chiefly an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> value; their number is said to be about 8,000. There are also in the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> and archives of each <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> a great many documents (donations, privileges, charters) in Greek, Georgian, and Old-Slavonic, beginning with the ninth century, some of which are important for the historian of Byzantine law and of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> (Miklosich and M&uuml;ller, Zachari&auml; von Linenthal, Uspenskij). The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Mount Athos are somewhat indifferent towards these treasures; nothing has been done to make them accessible, except the unsuccessful attempt of Archbishop Bulgaris of <a href="04362a.htm">Corfu</a> to found at Mount Athos, towards the close of the eighteenth century, a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the classical languages. The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> conduct a few elementary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for the teaching of reading and writing; nowhere, perhaps, is the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> stagnation of the Greek Schism more noticeable. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> are chiefly devoted to the splendor of their religious services; the solitaries still cherish <a href="07301a.htm">Hesychast</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> and an apocalyptic <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, and the whole monastic republic represents just such an <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> decay as must follow on a total exclusion of all outside intercourse and a complete neglect of all <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> effort (<a href="08611a.htm">Kaulen</a>).</p>
