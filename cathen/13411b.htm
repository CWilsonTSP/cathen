<p>(SALISBURGENSIS)</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of Salzburg is conterminous with the Austrian crown-land of the same name. The Romans appeared in the lands south of the Danube under <a href="02107a.htm">Emperor Augustus</a>, laid out roads, founded towns, and turned the territory into a province. Salzburg belonged to Noricum. <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced by individual colonists, artisans, and soldiers; St. Maximilian, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laureacum (Lorch), is mentioned as the first <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> of Noricum during the era of the persecutions. Although Constantine brought peace to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Romanized territory was subsequently exposed on all sides to the attacks of barbarian peoples, and the last representative of Roman civilization in Noricum was St. Severus (d. 482). He visited Cucullae (Kuchel near Hallein) and Juvavum (Salzburg), where he found a church already established and witnessed the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the priest-abbot Maximus. His apostolate was "the last ray before utter darkness"; the whole territory was soon devastated by barbarian tribes, and it was only about 700 that <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization again made its appearance. <a href="13229a.htm">St. Rupert</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Worms, <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> Duke Theodo of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, erected at Waldersee a church in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Peter, and made Juvavum, where he found the Roman buildings over-grown with brambles, his episcopal seat. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was also named after St. Peter, and Rupert's niece, Avendrid, founded the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Nonnberg. <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> completed the work of <a href="13229a.htm">St. Rupert</a>, placed the Diocese of Salzburg under the <a href="09550a.htm">Primatial See of Mainz</a>, and substituted the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> for the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in <a href="13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. He had a dispute with their abbot-bishop Virgil concerning the existence of the <a href="01581a.htm">antipodes</a>. Virgil dispatched the regionary <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> Modestus to Carinthia, of which the latter became the apostle. Under Virgil the valuable "Liber confraternitatum", or confraternity book of St. Peter's, was begun.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Arno, the successor of Virgil, enjoyed the respect of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who, after overthrowing the Avars, assigned to him as his missionary territory all the land between the Danube, the Raab, and the Drave. While Arno was at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> attending to some business for <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, <a href="09157b.htm">Leo III</a> appointed him <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> over the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. When the dispute concerning the delimitation of their ecclesiastical provinces broke out between Aquileia and Salzburg, <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> declared the Drave the boundary. The dignity of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> as territorial sovereigns must be also traced to <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. Arno took advantage of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life at the court of the great emperor to have <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> copied in 150 volumes, thus forming the oldest <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The efforts of Duke Wratislaus of Moravia to withdraw his territory from the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> influence of the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> prepared great trouble for Archbishop Adalwin. <a href="01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> appointed Methodius <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Pannonia and Moravia; it was only when Wratislaus had fallen into the hands of Louis the German that Adalwin could protest effectually against the invasion of his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. Methodius appeared at the Synod of Salzburg, was struck in the face, and was kept in close confinement for two and a half years. To the endeavour of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to demonstrate to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> of his claims we are indebted for the important work, "De conversione Bulgarorum et Carantanorum libellus". However, Adalwin was compelled to release Archbishop Methodius at the command of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Darkness once more settled on the land, when the Magyars ravaged the great <a href="10561a.htm">Moravian</a> empire; not a church remained standing in Pannonia, as the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> informed the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and Archbishop Thiadmar fell in battle. Michaelbeuern was set aflame. With the crushing defeat of the Magyars at Lechfeld (955) begins a henceforth unarrested <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization in Salzburg. When, shortly after this, Liudolf of Swabia and Conrad of Lothringen rose against Otto the Great and induced Archbishop Herold to become their associate, the latter was seized, blinded, deposed, and finally banished.</p>

<p>The tenth century is for <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> the <em>saeculum obscurum</em>, the era of feuds of the opposing factions of the nobility. In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, on the contrary, the episcopate flourished, and in this prosperity Salzburg also participated. The emperor's brother, Bishop Bruno of Cologne, the "bishop-maker", <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Friedrich for Salzburg, who in turn <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="15682b.htm">St. Wolfgang</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Friedrich declared the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Peter independent. In 996 Archbishop Hartwik received the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to coin money; in the presence of <a href="07227a.htm">Saint Henry II</a> and his spouse Kunigunde, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the church on the Nonnberg. When St. Hemma, Countess of Friesach, founded the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="07088b.htm">Gurk</a> in 1042, the first <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, Ita, was chosen from Nonnberg. In Salzburg the noble tendencies and great principles of the age of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and his immediate successors, aiming at the sanctification of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the success of the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, the fostering of <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> among the people, and the development of monastic life, were always encouraged. The first <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of this period was Gebhard. Three students had set out for <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> to study <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; during a night spent in a forest-glade near a spring, they confided to one another their ideals for the future &#151; each wished to become a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and each vowed in this contingency the foundation of a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Their hopes were gratified: Adalbert became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wurzburg and founded Lambach in Upper <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>; St. Altmann of <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a> founded G&ouml;ttweig for twelve canons, who were replaced twelve years later by <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> from St. Blasien in the Black forest; Gebhard founded Admont (1074) and the <a href="07088b.htm">Diocese of Gurk</a> (1072). These <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were the mainstays of the "cause of St. Peter" in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. They held aloof from the Synod of Worms to which <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> summoned the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> to declare their opposition to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Henry therefore named an anti-bishop for Salzburg, Bertold of Moosburg, and Gebhard had to endure an exile of nine years; shortly before his death he was able to return, and was buried at <a href="01145a.htm">Admont</a> (1088). His successor Theimo <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the church and <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Paul in Carinthia. Defeated by the royal <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Bertold, he was kept in strict confinement for five years at Freisach; scarcely had he recovered his liberty when he joined in the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> of <a href="07056c.htm">Guelph</a> of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, was again thrown into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, and suffered a horrible <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (1102). On the abdication of <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>, Count Conrad I of Abensberg was elected <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; Conrad accompanied Henry V to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when he went thither to receive imperial <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>. Paschal II and Henry came to an agreement according to which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> should renounce all claim to imperial fiefs and the emperor all claim to investiture. When this condition, on which the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> was to take place 12 February, 1111, became known, the German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and even the secular nobility protested against it, fearing lest by an onslaught on all the imperial fiefs the king should make his power absolute. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was held in confinement, the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> robbed of their rich vestments, the church plate, and even the buckles of their shoes. When the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> complained of this treatment, a German <a href="03691a.htm">knight</a> threatened to cleave his head in twain. His dignified bearing rendering it impossible to maintain his position in Salzburg, he lived an exile until the investiture strife was definitely settled by the Calistine Concordat of 1122. Conrad henceforth devoted all his energy to his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; he replaced the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by <a href="03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>, whose rule he himself adopted in 1122, and established a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of canonesses. At Seckau also he established the canons, and appointed the celebrated <a href="06472a.htm">Gerhoh</a> <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a> of Reichersberg. He meanwhile granted establishments to the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> (Georgenberg, Fiecht), <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> (Victring in Carinthia), Praemonstratensians (Wilten near Innsbruck). The Church of St. Peter was also rebuilt in Romanesque style; while previously the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of St. Peter's had elected the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, they abdicated this right in favour of the canons by the agreement of 1139 between the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> and the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the first contest between the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and empire during the Hohenstaufen period, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Salzburg had taken the side of the <a href="07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>. When, in 1159, <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick I</a> declared in favour of <a href="15411a.htm">Victor IV</a>, the creature of two <a href="07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, against <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, Archbishop Eberhard I, Count of Hippoldstein, steadily supported Alexander. <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> left him in peaceful possession of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> until his death. However, his successor, Conrad II, son of Leopold III the Pious, aroused Frederick's <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a>, and died a fugitive at <a href="01145a.htm">Admont</a> in 1168. <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> now stood at the acme of his fortune. He opposed to Archbishop Adalbert, son of King Wladislaus II of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, as anti-bishop Provost Henry of Berchtesgaden; however, at the Diet of <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1177) &#151; "the last great diet of the Middle Ages", <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor exchanged embraces &#151; it was agreed that both <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> should abdicate, and that Conrad III of Wittelsbach should receive the <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, and appoint the imperial <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to the <a href="09550a.htm">See of Mainz</a>. Through Conrad the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Salzburg received the rank of <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> Apostolic throughout the whole <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Noricum, and therewith the dignity of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. On Conrad's death Adalbert again succeeded to the archdiocese. On account of his excessive strictness he was confined in the castle of Werfen for fourteen days by his own officials. When <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> adopted the policy of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> in a still more exaggerated form, and was consequently <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, Archbishop Eberhard II of Regensberg (Switzerland) and his friend Duke Leopold VI brought about the Peace of San Germano (1230). The <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> leaders met at <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, whither the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> also came, but the duke died on the way to the meeting. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="09247b.htm">Lilienfeld</a>, founded by the duke, and <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> him there. Meanwhile the <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> had created within his territory three new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> to give increased efficiency to the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>: Chiemsee (1216), Seckau (1218), St. Andrew's in the Lavantal (1225). For these <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> also the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was not only to nominate, but also to confirm and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a>. On account of his friendly relations with the emperor it is evident that he exercised the prerogatives of sovereignty, and is to be <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> as "the founder of the land of Salzburg". For refusing to publish the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the First General Council of Lyons, which <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Frederick and relieved him of his empire, Eberhard also incurred <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. When he died suddenly the following year, still under the ban, his body was buried in the annex of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>-church of Radstadt, but forty years later it was transferred to <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> ground in Salzburg <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.</p>

<p>During the Austrian, and the almost simultaneous German, interregna Salzburg shared in the general confusion, and had its anti-bishop. Archbishop Philip, Count of Ortenburg, was more warrior than cleric and steadfastly refused to accept <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>. In foreign politics he favoured William of <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, the candidate for the throne set up by the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> party; in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> he espoused the cause of Premysl Ottaar favored by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> that each bishop-elect must be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> within half a year affected Philip immediately; as he paid no attention, Bishop Ulrich of <a href="13672a.htm">Seckau</a> was appointed in his place, and finally he himself was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and Salzburg placed under an <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>. The people thereupon drove Philip out and invited Ulrich to enter into possession; as, however, the latter was unable to repay the money which he had been compelled to borrow in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he also was expelled. He was finally able to return to Salzburg, but merely celebrated the feast of <a href="04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> in 1265 (which <a href="15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> had extended to the whole Church the year before) and then resigned. Rudolph of Habsburg brought to a close the interregnum. Throughout the whole series of years and on all important occasions including the investiture of his sons, Albert and Rudolph, with <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="14318a.htm">Styria</a>, <a href="08696a.htm">Krain</a>, and the Wendish March (27 December, 1280), Archbishop <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of Walchen (Pinzgau) was a faithful supporter of Rudolph, and must thus be numbered among the founders of Habsburg rule in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Human inclinations and alliances are subject to rapid change. Rudolph's son, Duke Albert I of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, engaged in an almost uninterrupted feud for ten years with <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Rudolph of Hoheneck and Conrad IV of Praitenfrut. Repeatedly the armies stood so close to each other that "each could see the white in his opponents' eyes"; several towns were demolished (Friesach). The mischief-maker was Abbot Henry of Admont, who enjoyed Albert's confidence; no sooner had this warlike cleric met death from an arrow-would received in the chase, than duke and <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> found themselves on terms of peace and friendship (1297). During the succeeding period German history is dominated by the conflicts of the houses of Wittelsbach and Habsburg. The people of Salzburg remained true to the Habsburgs. During the struggle for the throne between Louis the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> and Frederick III, Archbishop Frederick III of Leibnitz was declared an outlaw. During the seventy years' residence of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> in <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> subsequent to 1309, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> had to proceed thither to receive the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a>. When, in 1347, the frightful plague known as the Black Death swept through Salzburg, the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> were accused of poisoning the wells and subjected to cruel <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>.</p>

<p>In imitation of the confederated towns in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, five towns in the territory of Salzburg formed the <em>Igelbund</em> (1403). They presented to the new <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Eberhard III of Neuhaus, an election capitulation demanding, in an instrument which was surrounded with their seals as a boar (<em>Igel</em>) with bristles, the redress of their grievances (taxes). Already the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> had been widely accused of stabbing <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Hosts, which, it was said, were subsequently discovered emitting blood (Lower <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and Carinthia). As similar <a href="04748c.htm">desecrations</a> were declared to have taken place in Salzburg, the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> were banished in 1404 and a synodal ordinance declared a little later that they should be distinguishable by a pointed hat. During the <a href="13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> the attitude of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> toward the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> varied. Archbishop Pilgrim II of Puchheim at first supported the Roman <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, but subsequently espoused the cause of the <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> pontiff, <a href="13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>. His successor, Gregory of Osterwitz, also obtained the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. When <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> was <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of both parties, wishing to end the Schism, summoned the <a href="12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> (1409). This assembly deposed both <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and elected <a href="01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> <a href="12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>, but, as the earlier <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> refused to abdicate, there were now three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. Archbishop Eberhard III supported the Pisan <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. In his affectionate care for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, King Sigismund associated himself with <a href="08434a.htm">John</a> in convening the <a href="04288a.htm">General Council of Constance</a>. <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> was already condemned when Eberhard arrived with a large retinue; however, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> participated in the condemnation of Jerome of Prague. In 1428 Eberhard convened a great provincial synod of his <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the superiors of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and deputies of the <a href="15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>; at this assembly earlier <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> regulations were renewed, and new measures adopted for the revival of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. In the next year a provincial synod was again held. As the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> and <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> threatened to infect the province, it was decreed that no one should permit a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> to preach or harbour him; on the contrary, he should be denounced to the people. Dukes, counts etc. were to imprison all <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> suspected of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>; <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> should wear a cornered hat and their wives should carry attached to their clothing a small bell.</p>

<p>The <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> epoch was for Salzburg an era of cultural decay, caused by the incompetence of the territorial princes and the bad conditions of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> under Emperor Frederick IV. The first <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, sent out <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> to announce the jubilee <a href="07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, to promote a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and to inaugurate the reform of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <a href="11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a> on the Mosel (Cusanus), appointed <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> for <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, held a provincial synod at Salzburg (1451) in which <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were directed to return to the observance of the rule within the interval of a year. Three visitors (Abbot Martin von den Schotten, Abbot Laurence of Mariazell, and Prior Stephen of Melk) visited the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and in about fifty established uniform obedience to the rule. Under Archbishop Bernhard the political and <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> depression of the archdiocese was the deepest. Seeing the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> ravaging the <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> lands in Carinthia, and the estates of his territory making ever increasing demands and imposing taxes of various kinds, Bernhard summoned a diet in 1473 &#151; the first held in the little <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> state. He resigned his office but recalled his resignation repeatedly, until finally, five years before his death, he really abdicated. At the close of this period Leonhard of Keutschach (d. 1519) revived <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>: with astounding energy he had the burgomasters and town councillors, who were imposing <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> burdens, arrested simultaneously and confined in the castle; all <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> were banished from the land. His closing years were embittered by his suffragan Matthaeus Lang, who, although not a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, was <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07088b.htm">Gurk</a> and <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and aimed at the <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>. Lang promised the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter (<a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>) to effect its transformation into a chapter of <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, if the canons would recognize him as coadjutor with right of succession. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, decreeing these changes, soon arrived. In ecclesiastical art, late Gothic ruled at Salzburg, as is gloriously demonstrated in the church on the Nonnberg and its <a href="04558a.htm">crypts</a>, the Margarethenkapelle in the cemetery of St. Peter, and the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church with its magnificent vault of netted work</p>

<p>The <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> see, for which Matthaeus Lang had so passionately striven, was for him a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr's</a> chair. Not yet a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, the new ruler entered his episcopal city. Although unnoticed in official circles, the innovations emanating from <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> were insinuating themselves into the archdiocese. Mining was rapidly developed, and miners arrived from <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a> bringing with them the new doctrines and sectarian books. Lang strove to retain his subjects in the Faith: <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> proclaimed him a "monster", the people of Salzburg besieged him in his fortress Hohen-Salzburg (the Latin War), and two successive risings of the peasants were the occasion of manifold horrors and of unspeakable suffering for the ruler and his land. Lang was present at the Second Diet of <a href="14214e.htm">Speyer</a> (1529); and in the following year held lengthy negotiations with <a href="10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> at <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. The fact that Lang invited <a href="08748a.htm">lay persons</a> to the provincial synod of 1537, at which it was resolved to send delegates to a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>, created an unpleasant commotion in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, since it was feared that this step presaged the formation of a national Church. In accordance with Ferdinand's demand for the use of the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> by the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> in 1564, <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> granted this privilege for <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the <a href="01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="06721b.htm">Gran</a> and Prague; however, as the emperor's hopes were soon to be unfounded, the giving of Communion under both species ceased at Salzburg in 1571. The beneficent effects of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> extended also to Salzburg, where, for the execution of its decrees, Archbishop Jacob of Kuen-Belasy summoned in 1569 a provincial council, according to Hauthaler the most important of all the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of Salzburg, since through it "was secured for ever a solid foundation for church reform in this province in accordance with the spirit of the decrees of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a>". Four years later he again convened a provincial council, especially notable as almost three centuries were to elapse before another provincial council was held in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>.</p>

<p>The succeeding <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> by wise moderation preserved their territory from the sufferings of the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion, conducted elsewhere with bloodshed and cruelty. Lang's successor, Archbishop Ernst, administered the archdiocese for fourteen years as "elected bishop", although the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had confirmed his election only on the condition that he should receive episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> within ten years, and although his brother, Duke William of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, was a strict <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. During this period flourished Theophrastus Paracelsus (Philip of Hohenheim), the celebrated physician and <a href="01272b.htm">alchemist</a>, also Berthold, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chiemsee, a strict censor of his age (see <a href="02520a.htm">BERTHOLD OF CHIEMSEE</a>).</p>

<p>After the religious Peace of Augsburg Archbishop Wolf Dietrich (Wolfgang Theodorich) of Raitenau and his successors acted on the policy adopted there (<em>cujus regio, ejus religio</em>) and followed the precedent set by <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes, when they gave their subjects the option of professing the religion of their fathers or emigrating. The task of influencing the people by sermon and exhortation was confided mainly to the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. The former were given the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in St. Peter's, where previously the daughters of the nobility and the townsfolk had been <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a>. Archbishop Wolf Dietrich also encountered opposition at Salzburg when he began to tear down the ancient Romanesque <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; years were consumed in the destruction of the venerable stone edifice. He commissioned Vincenzo Scamozzi to draw up the plan of a new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was to surpass in magnificence everything in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was cross-shaped, had three <a href="10724a.htm">naves</a>, a central <a href="04569d.htm">cupola</a>, cross-arms ending in a semicircle, and two huge towers on the <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. However, when the plan was completed and building was to be begun, the indefatigable <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> found himself badly involved. The closing five years of his life were sad. To protect the salt-makers of Salzburg from the <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> customs regulations of Duke Maximilian of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, he resorted to military demonstrations, which constituted a breach of national peace. The soldiers of the duke took him <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and brought him to the castle of Hohen-Salzburg. Here he was subjected to unworthy treatment, and, although a promise to abdicate if liberated was extorted from him, he was retained a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> until his death five years later (1612). His successor, Marcus Sitticus of Hohenems, who had so ill-used him, was a relative; it may be that Sitticus feared that the great recklessness of Wolf Dietrich would imperil the peace of the archdiocese. In 1614 Sitticus began the rebuilding of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, in which the architect, Santino Solair, "has bequeathed one of the most magnificent creations of the <a href="02303b.htm">barocco style of architecture</a> outside <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>" (Ilg). It was also this <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> who finished the residence and castle of Mirabell, and restored Hellbrunn with its fountains. While <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> were ravaged in the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> and civilization declined, Archbishop <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Count of Lodron, accomplished such fruitful works of peace that he is remembered as "the father of his country". The <a href="01326c.htm">Alma</a> Benedictina (1623), for almost two hundred years the <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> of Salzburg, was his work; Ferdinand II granted it the power of conferring academic degrees in all four faculties. In 1628 Archbishop Lodron <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Archbishop Max Gandolf, Count of Kuenberg, built in 1674 the celebrated <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> church of Maria Plain; his successor, John Ernest, Count of Thun, built the college church, Fischer of Erlach being the architect. The wonderful chimes also date from this period.</p>

<p>Under Leopold Anton, Freiherr von Firmian, <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> tendencies revealed themselves more vigorously than before, supported and promoted by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> members of the imperial estates. In imitation of the <em>Corpus evangelicorum</em>, the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> of the Salzburg territory formed a league, binding themselves by <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> and an outward rite of mutual sprinkling of salt. The infection grew dangerous. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> did all he could; he invited the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> as missionaries, and engaged the help of the emperor. Later he enforced the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the religious Peace of Augsburg: recantation or emigration. In ten years about 30,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> left the territory and settled in East Prussia, or in Wurtemberg or <a href="07127c.htm">Hanoverian</a> territory; a few <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to Georgia in North America. A child of the era of "Enlightenment", Archbishop Jerome Count Colloredo laboured in its spirit and with the same persistent rashness as <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. However, his precipitate innovations in both the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> system and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters alienated from him the minds of the people, as had happened in the case of his imperial prototype. The fact that the four <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of the highest rank in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> declared as the first point in the Punctuation of Ems that the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> should be reduced to those which he enjoyed during the first three centuries, betrays a rare historical sense, since the sawed off the branch on which they sat. While Jerome in this case followed too blindly the lead of <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, he displayed his <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> when the emperor wished to erect new ecclesiastical provinces in <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and Graz. The Graz province was to be governed by an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Gorz was to be a simple diocese, and all the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Inner <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> &#151; including the projected Diocese of Leoben &#151; were to be placed under Graz. Colloredo refused his consent, whereupon the emperor retaliated by seizing the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> possessions of Salzburg in Inner <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, without, however, changing the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> attitude. Finally, after two years' negotiations, a settlement was arrived at on 19 April, 1786; Salzburg abdicated its episcopal <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> in Styrea and Carinthia in favour of the Bishops of Sekkau, Leoben, <a href="07088b.htm">Gurk</a>, and Lavant, but retained its <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> over them, enjoyed the right of <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> for Sekkau and Lavant at every vacancy, and for Gurk at every third vacancy. For Leoben &#151; of which, however, Engel was the first and last <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> &#151; the founder was to have the right of <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a>, and the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> the right of confirmation.</p>

<p>The classical writers of <a href="10648a.htm">church music</a> throw a radiance about Salzburg at this period. The house in which <a href="10623a.htm">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> was born (1756) now contains the <a href="10623a.htm">Mozart</a> museum, with compositions of the master, and his skull (a legacy of <a href="07611b.htm">Hyrtl</a>). <a href="10623a.htm">Mozart</a> died in 1791 at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, whither he had come at the age of twenty years. <a href="07158a.htm">Michael Haydn</a> occupied throughout his life the position of orchestral conductor of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Salzburg (d. 1806) Archbishop Jerome was a special patron of <a href="07158a.htm">Haydn</a>, and was delighted by the master's new composition for almost every <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> function. Among <a href="07158a.htm">Haydn's</a> works are thirty masses, over one hundred graduals, and the glorious "Hier liegt vor deiner Majestat" (Here lies before Thy Majesty). These and the incomparably beautiful responsories of <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> express a deep religious sentiment. Salzburg suffered much through the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, which led to the destruction of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principality. The signers of the Peace of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> agreed on one point, that <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territory should furnish the means of mutual compensation, the so-called "secularization". Similarly the men of the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> soon confiscated all <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>, and the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>, their apt pupils, completed the secularization in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Imperial Delegate at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> lost three and a half million adherents and a yearly income of twenty million gulden (about $8,000,000). The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Salzburg were deprived in the same year of their temporal sovereignty; Jerome, the last <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sovereign of Salzburg, died at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>.</p>

<p>During the first two decades of the nineteenth century, Salzburg had a chequered fate: from 1803 to 1805 it was an electorate under Grand-Duke Ferdinand of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>; from 1805 to 1809 it passed into the possession of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, from 1809 to the Peace of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> it was <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>. Short as was the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> dominion, Montegelas found time to overturn all the old institutions. In 1810 the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was dissolved, although the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty remained; the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were forbidden to receive <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>, and they owed their continued existence to Crown-Prince Ludwig. The Peace of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> restored this beautiful land to the mild rule of the Habsburgs. Francis I gave it an eminent <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in Augustin Gruber. Gruber was born at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and developed, as catechist at St. Anna's and as teacher of catechetics for the alumni, into the classical writer on <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction. His "Theorie der Katechetik" and "Praktisches Handbuch der Katechetik fur Katholiken" (2 vols.) have appeared in numerous editions. As aulic councillor for <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, Gruber drafted the statute of organization for the Archdiocese of Salzburg, on his succession to which he laboured in the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> spirit of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. Always mild and affectionate, he won back even the obstinate <a href="09590a.htm">Manharter Sect</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; he lectured personally to the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students, especially on <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and the "Regula pastoralis" of <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>. On his tours of visitation, he would question the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest concerning the theme suitable to the local conditions, and would immediately preach thereon. One cannot read without emotion his correspondence and hear of his personal relations with Prince Friedrich Schwarzenberg, who became in more than one respect his successor. John Cardinal Katschthaler is the eighty-third <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the seventy-fourth <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Salzburg. The archdiocese contains 270,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 483 <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 216 male religious in 11 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, and 998 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> in 102 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>.</p>
