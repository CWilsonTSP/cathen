<p>The National College of Saint Patrick, at Maynooth in County Kildare, about twelve miles from <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, founded in the year 1795. <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> still had her own Parliament; and, although <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could not sit in it, the spirit of toleration and liberty which had swept over the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> could not be excluded from its debates. Several relaxations had already been granted in the application of the <a href="11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, and it is to the credit of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> that during their short period of Parliamentary liberty (1782-1801), they could have entered so heartily on the path of national brotherhood, and have given to the world two such illustrious names as Edmund Burke and Henry Grattan. It was to these two men, more than to any statesmen of their time, that the foundation of Maynooth College may be ascribed. Other circumstances were also favourable. On the one hand, the programme of the "United Irishmen" (1798) proclaimed the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of universal toleration and liberty of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>. On the other hand, the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> Government was glad of an opportunity to withdraw young <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> as far as possible from the revolutionary influences to which they were exposed on the Continent. Moreover, soldiers were needed at a time when <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> was raging or threatening on all sides, and it had become <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to conciliate the class from amongst whom the best <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> soldiers could be recruited.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1794 a memorial was presented to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> viceroy by Dr. Troy, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, on behalf of all the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. This memorial set forth that the <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> had never been charged with disaffection to the State or irregularity in their conduct; that, on the contrary, they had been complimented more than once for inculcating obedience to the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and veneration of His Majesty's royal <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> and government. It was then pointed out that the foreign colleges, in which about 400 students were <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> for the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> mission, had been closed, and their funds confiscated; and that, even had they remained open, it would no longer be safe to send <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students abroad, "lest they should be contaminated with the contagion of sedition and infidelity" and thus become the means of introducing into <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the pernicious maxims of a licentious philosophy. The memorial was favourably received, and, in the following year Mr. Pelham, the Secretary of State, introduced his Bill for the foundation of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college. The Bill passed rapidly through all its stages and received the royal assent on 5 June, 1795. The management of the institution was given to a Board of Trustees who were to appoint all the officers, the president, masters, fellows, and scholars, to fix their salaries and make all <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> by-laws, rules, and <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>. No <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could act as trustee, or fill any other office, or be admitted as a student, who did not first take the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance prescribed for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the thirteenth and fourteenth years of George III. No <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> or son of a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> could be received in the new Academy under the severest pains and penalties. The Lord Chancellor, however, and several judges of the high courts, were to act as Trustees ex officio. The endowment voted by Parliament was &#163;8,000 (about $40,000) year. Dr. Thomas Hussey, a graduate of the <a href="08158a.htm">Irish College</a> of Salamanca, who had long been <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Spanish Embassy in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, was appointed first president. The next step was to fix upon the site. At first Dublin, or the suburbs of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, seemed to offer the chief advantages; finally, however, after a variety of proposals had been considered, Maynooth was chosen, because it was considered favourable to the <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> and studies of a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a>; also, because the Duke of Leinster, who had always been a friend of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, wished to have the new institution on his estate. The money granted by Parliament was voted for a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>: that was the express intention of the Government, but, as the Act was drawn in general terms, the trustees proceeded to erect a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> for <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> in connection with the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> establishment. This college was suppressed by the Government in 1801. Another lay college was then erected in the immediate vicinity of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college, and was continued up to 1817 under lay trustees. The establishment of various colleges in other parts of the country for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> made it unnecessary. Not long after the foundation of Maynooth, the whole country being convulsed by the rebellion of 1798, the general disturbance found an echo in the new institution. Of its sixty-nine students no fewer than eighteen or twenty were expelled for having taken the rebel <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>.</p>

<p>A valuable endowment was obtained for the new college on the death of John Butler, twelfth Baron Dunboyne, who had been <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a> from 1763 to 1786. On the death of his nephew, Pierce Butler, the eleventh baron, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> succeeded to the title and estates. This temporal dignity, however, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> his undoing; he gave up his <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, <a href="01044d.htm">abjured</a> the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and took a wife. In his last illness he repented and endeavoured to make reparation for his conduct by willing his <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> in <a href="10097a.htm">Meath</a>, valued at about &#163;1,000 (about $5,000) a year, to the newly founded college. The will was disputed at law by the next of kin. The case of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was pleaded by John Philpot Curran, and a compromise was effected by which about one half of the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> was secured to the college. The income from the bequest became the foundation of a fund for the maintenance of a higher course of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies in the case of such students as should have distinguished themselves in the ordinary course. This is still known as the "Dunboyne Establishment". After the union with <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> the financial subsidy to Maynooth from the State underwent various changes and gave rise to debates of considerable acrimony in the House of Commons. In 1845, however, the government of Sir Robert Peel raised the grant from &#163;9,500 (about $47,500) to &#163;26,000 ($230,000) a year and placed on the consolidated fund, where it formed part of the ordinary national <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> and was free from annual discussion on the estimates. Sir Robert Peel also granted a sum of &#163;30,000 (about $150,000) for suitable buildings; and it was then that the Gothic structure designed by <a href="12558b.htm">Pugin</a>, one of the handsomest college buildings in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, was erected. The disestablishment of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church by Mr. Gladstone in 1869, had serious financial results for Maynooth which was also disendowed; but a sum of about &#163;370,000 (about $1,850,000) was given once for all to enable the college to continue its work. This sum was invested for the most part in land, and has been very ably managed by the trustees. Some of the most prominent <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> in the country, such as the Earls of Fingall and Kenmare, had acted as Trustees up to the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the disendowment; from that time no further lay trustees were appointed.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Among the most distinguished of the past presidents of Maynooth were Hussey, Renehan, and Russell, a full account of whom is to be found the College History by the Most Rev. Dr. Heavy, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>. Dr. Hussey was the first president, and to his tact, judgment and skill the success of the original project was mainly due. Dr. Renehan was a distinguished <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholar, who did a great deal to rescue <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> from destruction. Dr. Russell is chiefly known for his "Life of <a href="10270b.htm">Cardinal Mezzofanti</a>" and for the part he took in the conversion of <a href="10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a>. Amongst the most distinguished teachers and men of letters who shed lustre on the college during its first century were <a href="09499a.htm">John MacHale</a>, Paul O'Brien, <a href="10646b.htm">Daniel Murray</a>, <a href="11294a.htm">Edmond O'Reilly</a>, Nicholas Callan, <a href="10646c.htm">Patrick Murray</a>, Mathew Kelly, John O'Hanlon, William Jennings, James O'Kane, and <a href="10442c.htm">Gerald Molloy</a>. It is interesting to notice that, on the staff of the college in its early years, were four French refugees--the Rev. Peter J. Delort, the Rev. Andrew Darre, the Rev. Louis Delahogue and the Rev. Francis Anglade--all Doctors of the Sorbonne. On the original staff may also be found the name of the Rev. John C. Eustace, author of the well-known "Classical Tour in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>". Amongst the distinguished personages who have visited the college were Thackeray, <a href="10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, Carlyle, Robert Owen, Cardinal Perraud, Huxley, the late Empress of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and King Edward VII. The college possesses several memorials of the Empress of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who lived in the neighbourhood during her visits to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The Centenary of the foundation of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was celebrated in 1895, on which occasion congratulations were sent from all the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> centres in the world. The college <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> contains upwards of 40,000 volumes. It possesses a great many rare and precious works and some very valuable <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The <em>Aula Maxima</em> which was opened about the year 1893 was the gift to his <em>Alma Mater</em> of the Right Rev. Mgr. MacMahon of the Catholic University at Washington, D. C., and previously of New York. The <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> which has just been completed is a work of rare beauty both in design and ornamentation. Maynooth has already sent out into the world upwards of 7,000 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. Her alumni are in all lands and in almost every position that an ecclesiastic could occupy. The average number of students in recent years is about 600. The ordinary <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course is four years, and the extra course of the "Dunboyne Establishment" three years more. Students in arts and philosophy have to graduate in the National University of which Maynooth is now a "recognized College".</p>
