<p>(Germ. <em>B&ouml;hmen</em>, or formerly <em>B&ouml;heim</em>; <a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Bohemia</em> or <em>Bojohemum</em>), a cisleithan (i.e. west of the River Leitha) crown province of the <a href="02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> Monarchy, which until 1526 was an independent kingdom.</p>

<h2>Physical characteristics</h2>

<p>Bohemia has an area of 20,058 square miles. It is bounded on the northwest by Saxony, on the northeast by <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Silesia, on the southeast by Moravia and the Grand duchy of Lower <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, on the south by the Grand duchy of Upper <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and on the southwest by <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. It is enclosed on three sides by mountain ranges, namely: the Bohemian Forest (B&ouml;hmerwald), the Ore mountains (Erzgebirge), and the Sudetic mountains. The highest peaks of these ranges seldom rise above 4,593 feet. On the fourth, or southeastern, border Bohemia is separated from <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a> by a moderately high range called the Bohemian-Moravian highlands (about 1,968 feet high). The country resembles the flat bottom of a trough with a depression towards the north. The average height above sea-level is 1,460 feet. Bohemia is drained by the Elbe, which rises in the Isergebirge, a range of the Sudetic mountain system. After receiving the waters of the Moldau, a stream from the south, the Elbe, now greatly increased in size, passes out of Bohemia at Tetschen near the most northern point of the country. Besides the Moldau, which may be called the most important river of Bohemia, the chief tributaries of the Elbe are the Iser and the Eger.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Geologically the country forms the so-called Bohemian system of mountain ranges, the spurs of which run into <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and Silesia. The greater part consists of old crystalline rocks; in the south gneiss predominates, in the north the formation is chiefly cretaceous sandstone, with tertiary deposits due to the action of water from the south. This part of the country also shows volcanic action, as in the Bohemian mineral springs. The climate is moderate and, with the exception of the mountain districts, does not show great variations of temperature. The mean temperature of the year is about 46.41 Fahrenheit. Bohemia has much mineral wealth; it is especially rich in silver, tin, lead, semiprecious stones, such as Bohemian garnets, hard coal, and lignite.</p>

<h2>Population</h2>

<p>According to the last census (31 December, 1900), Bohemia has a population of 6,318,697. It is one of the most thickly settled provinces of the monarchy, having 315 inhabitants to the square mile. The Czechs form 63 percent of the population, and the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> 36 per cent. The Germans live chiefly near the boundaries of the country especially near the northern and northwestern boundaries.</p>

<h2>National history</h2>

<p>Bohemia (home of the Boii) owes its name to the Boii, a Celtic people which occupied the country in prehistoric times. About 78 B.C. the land was occupied by a Suevic people, the Marcomanni, while the related tribe of the Quadi settled in <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and that part of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> adjoining Moravia. Some years after the birth of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Marbod King of the Marcomanni, united the German tribes as far as the North Sea and the Baltic to form a great confederation which menaced the Roman Empire. When the Marcomanni and the Quadi left Bohemia and Moravia in the sixth century, there came in from the northeast a Slavonic people which was soon to appear in history under the general name of Cechen (Czechs). Before the close of the sixth century this Slavonic people came under the domination of the Avars of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. But early in the seventh century they regained their freedom with the aid of the <a href="06238a.htm">Frank</a>, Samo, whom the Czechs elected as their king. In 706, Bohemia paid tribute to <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. Eighty years later Borziwoi, Grand Duke of the Cechen (Czechs), seems to have been tributary to Swatopluk, King of Great <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. In the confusion which followed the break-up of the Empire of Great <a href="10561a.htm">Moravia</a> Spitihnev I succeeded in uniting the various tribes of Czechs under his rule. From his time there is an unbroken succession of dukes of the Premysl line. One duke of this line, Wratislaw II, received the title of King for life from the German Emperor, <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>. After 1158 the title of King became hereditary. Ottokar I and Ottokar II were the most conspicuous rulers of the Premysl dynasty. After this line became extinct (1306) Bohemia came under the sway of John of Luxembourg (1310-46). The Bohemian rulers of the Luxembourg line, from Charles I, of Bohemia (the Emperor, Charles IV), until the extinction of the dynasty at the death of Sigismund (1437), were all German emperors. Bohemia reached the height of its prosperity under the Emperor Charles IV who conquered Silesia and also occupied for a time the Mark of Brandenburg and the Upper Palatinate. In 1348, Charles founded the <a href="12342a.htm">University of Prague</a>, the first <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> on German soil. By his Golden <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, Charles IV gave Bohemia the highest secular electoral dignity of the Holy Roman Empire. After 1437, Bohemia was ruled by kings of various lines until the death of Ludwig II, of the Jagellon dynasty, who was King of Bohemia and <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. He fell in the battle of Moh&aacute;cz (1526). Both Bohemia and <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> after this battle came into the possession of Ferdinand I of Hapsburg who had married the sister of Ludwig II. (For the further history of Bohemia see <a href="02121b.htm">Austro-Hungarian</a> Monarchy).</p>

<h2>Introduction of Christianity</h2>

<p>Fritigil, Queen of the Marcomanni, in 396 applied to <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose of Milan</a> for instruction in the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrines of Christianity</a>. In 846, fourteen princes of the Czechs were <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. Although the two brothers, <a href="04592a.htm">Cyril and Methodius</a>, the Apostles of the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, never entered Bohemia, yet Methodius was able to win over the Bohemian Duke Borziwoi to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> when the latter was at the court of Swatopluk, Grand Duke of Moravia. In 878, Borziwoi was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Methodius at Welehrad. Soon after this Borziwoi's wife, Ludmilla, and most of his relations were also <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>. The grandson of Borziwoi and Ludmilla, St. Wenzel I (Wenceslaus), was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> in 935 at Alt-Bunzlau by his brother and successor Boleslaw I. Religious and national motives prompted this act. <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> made such progress in Bohemia that in the latter part of the tenth century (973) the German <a href="11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> gave the country a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of its own with his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> at <a href="12338a.htm">Prague</a>, the capital of the country. Bohemia had until then formed a part of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. In 1344, the Diocese of Leitomischl was founded, while Prague was made an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> with the <a href="11247a.htm">Diocese of Olm&uuml;tz</a> as suffragan. The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries may be called the golden age of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Bohemia. In 1384, 240 <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were attached to the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Prague. Bohemia contained at that time 1,914 <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> with many assistants; there were one Hundred <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and almost a third of the land belonged to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. But when <a href="07584b.htm">John Hus</a> was condemned by the <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> for spreading the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, and was burned at the stake in 1415 by <a href="02137c.htm">secular authorities</a>, the Hussite <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> followed (1420-34), and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in Bohemia met with losses which it took centuries to repair.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The causes of this religious-national movement were the excessive numbers and wealth of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, their moral decay, and, in addition, the national reaction against the disproportionate power of the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>, and the weakness of the secular government. Notwithstanding the death of the leaders, <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> and Jerome of Prague, the fire of revolution broke out when the followers of <a href="07584b.htm">Hus</a> demanded the <a href="04175a.htm">Lord's Supper under both kinds</a> (Utraquists). Those in revolt encamped with their leaders, Ziska, Procopius the Great, and Procopius the Less, upon Mount Tabor, and from 1419 to 1434 they made marauding expeditions from that point in all directions. The army of Sigismund, In the <a href="04543c.htm#section5">Fifth Crusade</a>, accomplished nothing. An agreement was made finally with the moderate Utraquists (called Calixtines) in 1433. By this agreement, which is called "the Compactata of Basle" or "of Prague," the cup was granted to the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>; at the same time the teaching of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as to the <a href="05573a.htm">Real Presence of Christ</a> under each form was insisted upon. From the descendants of the radical Taborites sprang later the Bohemian and Moravian Brethren.</p>

<p>A great number of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and other cures of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> had been obliterated during the Hussite <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>; in those which still remained there, was a woeful lack of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> especially for the German population. It was, therefore, easy for <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> to make rapid advances, especially as it was looked on with favor by both the nobility and the people. Desertion of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was accompanied by treason against the hereditary dynasty part of the population took sides with the League of Smalkald, and in 1618 Bohemia was the starting point of the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> which brought such terrible disasters upon the whole of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. During this <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> the population of Bohemia fell from three millions to eight hundred thousand. The Hapsburg dynasty finally gained the victory. The nobility were punished for their treason, either by execution or by banishment, with confiscation of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>; the rebellious cities lost their freedom, the common people either <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> or returned to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. In 1655, the <a href="09141a.htm">See of Leitmeritz</a> was founded; in 1644 the Emperor Ferdinand IV erected a new <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> at <a href="08688b.htm">K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz</a>, to take the place of Leitomischl, which had disappeared during the Hussite <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>. Finally, in 1784, the <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> made the new Bishopric of <a href="03034b.htm">Budweis</a> out of the southern part of the <a href="12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a>.</p>

<h2>Present state of dioceses</h2>

<p>Bohemia is divided ecclesiastically as follows: The <a href="12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a> includes the northwestern and central parts of the country, the <a href="09141a.htm">Diocese of Leitmeritz</a> embraces the northern part, the <a href="08688b.htm">Diocese of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz</a> takes in the eastern part, and the <a href="03034b.htm">Diocese of Budweis</a> the southern part of the country. In addition to its share of the territory of Bohemia, the <a href="12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a> also includes the countship (<em>Grafschaft</em>) of Glatz in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Silesia.</p>

<h3>Religious orders</h3>

<h2>Relations of Church and state</h2>

<p>Since the last years of the reign of <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, and especially since the time of <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> has suffered from state interference. According to existing <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> the State at present guarantees to the recognized <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> freedom from molestation in the management of their internal affairs. The State avoids every interference in matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, of ritual, and of <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, but it also claims that the religious associations, like all other associations, are subject to the general state <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> in their "outward legal relations." The sore point in this condition of affairs is this: that the State assumes for itself the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to define the boundary between internal and external legal relations. At present state control shows itself in the appointment of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> officials, in the cooperation of the State in determining and collecting church dues and taxes, in measures for the protection of the <a href="12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, and in a certain supervision of the church press, which is hardly perceptible. The legal position of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> rests on the Imperial Patent of 8 April, 1861, and the Law of 7 May, 1874.</p>

<h3>Incorporation of churches</h3>

<p>In the <a href="12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a> there are 32 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> incorporated with the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> foundation at <a href="14514a.htm">Tepl</a>, the other orders in the diocese have 28 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> incorporated with them; in the <a href="09141a.htm">Diocese of Leitmeritz</a> the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Osseg control 11 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the other orders for men, 12; in the <a href="08688b.htm">Diocese of K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz</a> there are 10 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> united with the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> houses, and 6 with the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a>; in the <a href="03034b.htm">Diocese of Budweis</a> the Monastery of Hohenfurt controls 16 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the other orders have 13 incorporated with their foundations.</p>

<h3>Taxation of churches</h3>

<p>Churches, public <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and <a href="03504a.htm">cemeteries</a> are exempt from the income tax, ground and dwelling-tax.</p>

<h3>Privileges of the clergy</h3>

<p>Theological students are exempt, both in <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and in peace, from all forms of military service, from military training, exercise with weapons, and reserve service; but after they have been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> they can be called upon to serve as army <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> in case of the mobilization of the whole army. Parish <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are exempt from paying the direct and the local taxes, and from jury <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>. Parish <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> have the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to accept an election to community and district boards of commissioners. Regularly installed <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> have the right of legal residence in that community in which they live permanently. Without regard to the actual payment of taxes they are entitled to vote for the local boards, for the provincial diet and for the imperial parliament (Reichstag); as a rule they are included in the first class of the electoral body. Only one-third of the fees of a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> can be attached for <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>; besides this, his income cannot be reduced below 1,600 kronen ($320), nor the income of a retired <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> below 1,000 kronen ($200). According to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of 1898, which was intended to equalize <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> salaries, the salary of a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at Prague was set at 2400 kronen ($480); in the suburbs up to a distance of over nine miles from the capital, and in cities with over 5,000 inhabitants, at 1,800 kronen ($360); in other places at 1,600 kronen ($320) or 1,400 kronen ($280). In Prague the salary of an assist <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> was set at 800 kronen ($160) or 700 kronen ($140).</p>

<h2>Marriage and divorce</h2>

<p>Marriage, for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, rests on the Law of 25 May, 1868, with which the second main section of the civil code, treating of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of marriage, came again into force. According to this anyone can enter into a marriage contract when there is no legal impediment. Apart from the impediments arising from the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of certain positions and those due to the army <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> these impediments rest on: (1) lack of consent; (2) lack of ability for the married state, and (3) lack of the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> formalities.</p>

<p>Under the first head are (a) impediments from inability to give consent, as <a href="08041a.htm">mental disease</a> (violent mania, lunacy, imbecility); minority, and control of guardians, or lack of free choice; (b) impediments resting on lack of actual consent, as compulsion through well-grounded fear, seduction, mistake in the identity of the future consort, pregnancy of the <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> before marriage by another <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>.</p>

<p>Under (2) belong (a) the impediment of impotency and (b) impediment from the lack of moral ability, such as an unexpired sentence of <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for felony; a still existing previous marriage; <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> to <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, or a solemn <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>; difference in religion (e.g. the marriage of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a non-Christian); relationship in the ascending and descending line, or close <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> connection (as brothers and sisters, cousins, uncle and niece, aunt and nephew); degrees of affinity parallel to the forbidden degrees of <a href="04264a.htm">consanguinity</a>; <a href="01163a.htm">adultery</a> <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> before the contracting of the new marriage; and <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> or attempted <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> of a consort.</p>

<p>In (3) are (a) the impediments arising from the lack of publication of the <a href="02255a.htm">banns</a>, and (b) those from lack of the prescribed formalities of a marriage contract. Lastly, there should also he mentioned the impediments, enacted by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>), of participation in the cause of <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a>, and the impediment caused by the lack of a certificate of birth. A temporary impediment exists for <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a>, who are not allowed, as a rule, to marry again before the expiration of six months after the death of the husband. Some of these <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> impediments to marriage can be set aside; others are irremovable. Among the latter are all those which would give an appearance of guilt to a marriage contracted under the existing circumstances. Dispensation from these impediments are granted by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> married couples can be separated from bed and board. A dissolution of the bond of marriage does not take place; that is, no married <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, either husband or wife, can enter upon a new valid marriage before the death of the consort.</p>

<h2>Testamentary laws</h2>

<p>A secular cleric has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to free disposal of his <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> both in life and at death. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> has no testamentary control over those objects which belong to his office and which by law descend to his successor, such as mitres, vestments intended to be worn during Mass, etc. In consequence of the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty, members of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders are incapable of inheriting or disposing of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. Large legacies to a church, a religious or charitable foundation, or a public institution must be announced at once by the court to the governor or president of the province. A half-yearly list of smaller legacies must be sent to these authorities. Legacies for the benefit of the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, those intended for religious or charitable foundations, for churches, <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, public institutions, or other religious and benevolent purposes must be paid over or secured before the Heirs can inherit the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>.</p>

<h2>Burial laws</h2>

<p>Old graveyards are ordinarily regarded as dependencies of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church, and as such are considered, even by the Law of 30 April, 1870, as being <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions. But in sanitary regards, as places of burial, they are controlled by the police regulations of the community. Denominational cemeteries can be enlarged or laid out anew. For this, however, the consent of the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> and of the parties interested is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, although, if the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> community refuses to enlarge the cemetery, the responsibility for providing a proper burial-place falls on the civil community. But a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> community or a church vestry cannot be compelled by the authorities to enlarge or lay out a church cemetery. If in the same community both a town cemetery and a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cemetery exist, the burial of the dead in the public cemetery is not <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, but every <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to bury the members of his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cemetery. When a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cemetery serves also for the burial of non-Catholics, a part of the cemetery is to be set apart for the exclusive use of the non-Catholic community. Where a part of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cemetery is used for non-Catholic burial without the formal separation of the parts, the non-Catholic <a href="04049b.htm">clergyman</a> must follow the regulations of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>; he may conduct the burial with <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and benediction, but there can be no singing nor address.</p>
