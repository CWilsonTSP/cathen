<p>(1049-54), b. at Egisheim, near Colmar, on the borders of Alsace, 21 June, 1002; d. 19 April, 1054. He belonged to a noble <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> which had given or was to give <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and rulers to the Empire. He was named Bruno. His father Hugh was first cousin to Emperor Conrad, and both Hugh and his wife Heilewide were remarkable for their <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. As a sign of the tender <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> which soon began to manifest itself in the saintly child, we are told that, though he had given abundant <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> of a bright mind, on one occasion he could not study out of an exceptionally beautiful book which his mother had bought and given to him. At length it transpired that the book had been <a href="14564b.htm">stolen</a> from the Abbey of <a href="07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a> in the Ardennes. When Heilewide had restored the volume to its rightful owners, the little Bruno's studies proceeded unchecked. When five years of age, he was committed to the care of the energetic Berthold, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul, who had a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for the sons of the nobility. Intelligent, graceful in body, and gracious in disposition, Bruno was a favourite with his schoolfellows. Whilst still a youth and at home for his holidays, he was attacked when asleep by some animal, and so much injured that for some time he lay between life and death. In that condition he saw, as he used afterwards to tell his friends, a vision of St. Benedict, who cured him by touching his wounds with a cross. This we are told by Leo's principal biographer, Wibert, who was his intimate friend when the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> was <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Bruno became a canon of St. Stephen's at Toul (1017), and though still quite young exerted a soothing influence on Herimann, the choleric successor of Bishop Berthold. When, in 1024, Conrad, Bruno's cousin, succeeded the Emperor Henry I, the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> relatives sent him to the new king's court "to serve in his <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>". His virtue soon made itself felt, and his companions, to distinguish him from others who bore the same name, always spoke of him as "the good Bruno". In 1026 Conrad set out for <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> to make his authority respected in that portion of his dominions, and as Herimann, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul, was too old to lead his contingent into the peninsula, he entrusted the command of it to Bruno, then a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>. There is reason to believe that this novel occupation was not altogether uncongenial to him, for soldiers seem always to have had an attraction for him. While he was thus in the midst of arms, Bishop Herimann died and Bruno was at once elected to succeed him. Conrad, who destined him for higher things, was loath to allow him to accept that insignificant see. But Bruno, who was wholly disinclined for the higher things, and wished to live in as much obscurity as possible, induced his sovereign to permit him to take the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. Consecrated in 1027, Bruno administered the Diocese of Toul for over twenty years, in a season of stress and trouble of all kinds. He had to contend not merely with famine, but also with <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, to which as a frontier town Toul was much exposed. Bruno, however, was equal to his position. He <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> how to make peace, and, if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to wield the sword in self-defence. Sent by Conrad to Robert the Pious, he established so firm a peace between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the empire that it was not again broken even during the reigns of the sons of both Conrad and Robert. On the other hand, he held his episcopal city against Eudes, Count of <a href="02602b.htm">Blois</a>, a rebel against Conrad, and "by his wisdom and exertions" added <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to the empire. It was whilst he was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> that he was saddened by the death not merely of his <a href="11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, but also of two of his brothers. Amid his trials Bruno found some consolation in music, in which he proved himself very efficient.</p>

<p>The German <a href="04614a.htm">Pope Damasus II</a> died in 1048, and the Romans sent to ask Henry III, Conrad's successor, to let them have as the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> either Halinard, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, or Bruno. Both of them were favourably known to the Romans by what they had seen of them when they came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. Henry at once fixed upon Bruno, who did all he could to avoid the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> which his sovereign wished to impose upon him. When at length he was overcome by the combined importunities of the emperor, the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>, and the Romans, he agreed to go to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and to accept the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> if freely elected thereto by the Roman people. He wished, at least, to rescue the See of Peter from its servitude to the German emperors. When, in company with <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> he reached <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and presented himself to its people clad in pilgrim's guise and barefooted, but still tall, and fair to look upon, they cried out with one voice that him and no other would they have as <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Assuming the name of Leo, he was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="05479c.htm">enthroned</a> 12 February, 1049. Before Leo could do anything in the matter of the reform of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on which his heart was set, he had first to put down another attempt on the part of the ex-Pope <a href="02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> to seize the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. He had then to attend to money matters, as the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> finances were in a deplorable condition. To better them he put them in the hands of <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, a man capable of improving anything.</p>

<p>He then began the work of reform which was to give the next hundred years a character of their own, and which his great successor <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> was to carry so far forward. In April, 1049, he held a synod at which he condemned the two <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a> evils of the day, <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> incontinence. Then he commenced those journeys throughout <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the cause of a reformation of manners which gave him a pre- eminent right to be styled <em>Peregrinus Apostolicus</em>. Leaving <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in May, he held a council of reform at <a href="11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, and pushed on through <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> to <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he joined the <a href="07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a>. In union with him he brought about peace in Lorraine by <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> the rebel Godfrey the Bearded. Despite the jealous efforts of King Henry I to prevent him from coming to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, Leo next proceeded to <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, where he held an important synod, at which both <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> from <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> assisted. There also assembled in the city to see the famous <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> an enormous number of enthusiastic people, "Spaniards, Bretons, <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and English". Besides <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04187b.htm">Compostela</a> (because he had ventured to assume the title of <em>Apostolicus,</em> reserved to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> alone), and forbidding marriage between William (afterwards called the Conqueror) and Matilda of <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, the assembly issued many decrees of reform. On his way back to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> Leo held another synod at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, everywhere rousing public opinion against the great evils of the time as he went along, and everywhere being received with unbounded enthusiasm. It is apparently in connexion with this return journey that we have the first mention of the <a href="06629a.htm">Golden Rose</a>. The <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Woffenheim, in return for certain privileges bestowed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, had to send to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> "a golden rose" before L&aelig;tare Sunday, on which day, says Leo, the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> are wont to carry it. Also before he returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he discussed with Adalbert, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, the formation of all the Scandinavian countries, including Iceland and Greenland, into a <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, of which the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was to be Bremen. The scheme was never accomplished, but meanwhile Leo authorized the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> by Adalbert of the first native <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for Iceland.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In January, 1050, Leo returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, only to leave it again almost immediately for Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, whither the sufferings of its people called him. They were being heavily oppressed by the Normans. To the expostulations of Leo the wily Normans replied with promises, and when the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, after holding a council at <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, they continued their oppressions as before. At the usual paschal synod which Leo was in the habit of holding at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius of Tours</a> was condemned&mdash;a condemnation repeated by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> a few months later at <a href="15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>. Before the year 1050 had come to a close, Leo had begun his second transalpine journey. He went first to Toul, in order solemnly to translate the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="06466a.htm">Gerard</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, whom he had just <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a>, and then to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> to interview the Emperor Henry the Black. One of the results of this meeting was that Hunfrid, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, was compelled by the emperor to cease acting as though he were the independent ruler of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and its district, and to submit to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Returning to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Leo held another of his paschal <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> in April, 1051, and in July went to take possession of <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. Harassed by their enemies, the Beneventans concluded that their only hope of peace was to submit themselves to the authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. This they did, and received Leo into their city with the greatest <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>. While in this vicinity, Leo again made further efforts to lessen the excesses of the Normans, but they were crippled by the native Lombards, who with as much folly as wickedness massacred a number of the Normans in Apulia. Realizing that nothing could then be done with the irate Norman survivors, Leo retraced his steps to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1051).</p>

<p>The Norman question was henceforth ever present to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> mind. Constantly oppressed by the Normans, the people of Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> ceased not to implore the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to come and help them. The Greeks, fearful of being expelled from the peninsula altogether, begged Leo to co-operate with them against the common foe. Thus urged, Leo sought assistance on all sides. Failing to obtain it, he again tried the effect of personal mediation (1052). But again failure attended his efforts. He began to be convinced that appeal would have to be made to the sword. At this juncture an embassy arrived from the Hungarians, entreating him to come and make peace between them and the emperor. Again Leo crossed the Alps, but, thinking he was sure of success, Henry would not accept the terms proposed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, with the result that his expedition against the Hungarians <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> a failure. And though he at first undertook to let Leo have a German force to act against the Normans, he afterwards withdrew his promise, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had to return to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> with only a few German troops raised by his relatives (1053). In March, 1053, Leo was back in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Finding the state of affairs in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> worse than ever, he raised what forces he could among the Italian princes, and, declaring <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> on the Normans, tried to effect a junction with the Greek general. But the Normans defeated first the Greeks and then the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at Civitella (June, 1053). After the battle Leo gave himself up to his conquerors, who treated him with the utmost respect and consideration, and professed themselves his soldiers.</p>

<p>Though he gained more by defeat than he could have gained by victory, Leo betook himself to <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, a broken-hearted man. The slain at Civitella were ever before him, and he was profoundly troubled by the attitude of <a href="10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a>, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. That ambitious <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> was determined, if possible, to have no superior in either Church or State. As early as 1042, he had struck the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> name off the sacred <a href="05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, and soon proceeded, first in private and then in public, to attack the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> because it used unfermented bread (azymes) in the <a href="10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. At length, and that, too, in a most barbarous manner, he closed the Latin churches in Constantinople. In reply to this <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a>, Leo addressed a strong letter to Michael (Sept., 1053), and began to study Greek in order the better to understand the matters in dispute. However, if Michael had taken advantage of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> difficulties with the Normans to push his plans, the Greek Emperor, seeing that his hold on Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was endangered by the Norman success, put pressure on the patriarch to make him more respectful to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. To the conciliatory letters which Constantine and <a href="10273a.htm">C&aelig;rularius</a> now dispatched to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Leo sent suitable replies (Jan., 1054), blaming the arrogance of the patriarch. His letters were conveyed by two distinguished <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Humbert and Frederick, but he had departed this life before the momentous issue of his embassy was known in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 16 July, 1054, the two <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="10273a.htm">C&aelig;rularius</a>, and the East was finally cut off from the body of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>The annals of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> show that Leo had many relations with that country, and its saintly King Edward. He dispensed the king from a <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> which he had taken to make a <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on condition that he give <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and endow a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Peter. Leo also authorized the translation of the See of Crediton to <a href="05708a.htm">Exeter</a>, and forbade the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the unworthy <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Abingdon (Spearhafor) as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. Throughout the troubles which Robert of Jumi&#232;ges, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, had with the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Earl Godwin, he received the support of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who sent him the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> and condemned Stigand, the usurper of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> (1053?). King Macbeth, the supposed murderer of Duncan, whom <a href="13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a> has immortalized, is believed to have visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> during Leo's pontificate, and may be thought to have exposed the needs of his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> to that tender father. After the battle of Civitella Leo never recovered his spirits. Seized at length with a mortal illness, he caused himself to be carried to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (March, 1054), where he died a most edifying death. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. Peter's, was a worker of <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> both in life and in death, and found a place in the Roman Martyrology.</p>
