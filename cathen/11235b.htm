<p>The <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> organised in German-speaking countries to combat the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a>.</p>

<p>Filled with <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> and rejecting the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit of submission to the teachings of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, nearly 1400 Germans issued, in September, 1870, a declaration in which they repudiated the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="07790a.htm">Infallibility</a> "as an innovation contrary to the traditional <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>". They were encouraged by large numbers of scholars, politicians, and statesmen, and were acclaimed by the <a href="09212a.htm">Liberal</a> press of the whole world. The break with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> began with this declaration, which was put forth notwithstanding the fact that the majority of the German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> issued, at <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> on 30 August, a common pastoral letter in support of the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>. It was not until 10 April, 1871, that Bishop Hefele of <a href="13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a> issued a letter concerning the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> to his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. By the end of 1870 all the <a href="02121b.htm">Austrian</a> and <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had done the same.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The movement against the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> was carried on with such energy that the first Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress was able to meet at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 22-24 September, 1871. Before this, however, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> had <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> on 17 April 1871, and later also Friedrich. The congress was attended by over 300 delegates from <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, besides friends from <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and the representatives of the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>, with German and American <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The moving spirit in this and all later assemblies for organization was Johann Friedrich von Schulte, the professor of <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> at Prague. Von Schulte summed up the results of the congress as follows:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Adherence to the ancient <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>;</li><li>maintenance of the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as such;</li><li>rejection of the new <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a>,</li><li>adherence to the constitutions of the ancient Church with repudiation of every <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> not in harmony with the actual consciousness of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>;</li><li>reform of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> with constitutional participation of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>;</li><li>preparation of the way for reunion of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> confessions;</li><li>reform of the training and position of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>;</li><li>adherence to the State against the attacks of <a href="15125a.htm">Ultramontanism</a>;</li><li>rejection of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>;</li><li>solemn assertion of the claims of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as such to the real <a href="12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> and to the title to it.</li></ul></div>

<p>A resolution was also passed on the forming of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> communities, which <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> vehemently opposed and voted against. The second congress, held at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 20-22 September, 1872, ws attended by 350 Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> delegates, besides one <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> and three <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Russian <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and English and other <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>. The election of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was decided on, and among the most important resolutions passed were those pertaining to the organization of the pastorate and <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. This was followed by steps to obtain recognition of the <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a> by various governments; the general feeling of that time made it easy to obtain this recognition from <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="02194a.htm">Baden</a>, and <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>. Professor Reinkens of Bonn was elected <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 4 June, 1873, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Rotterdam by the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Deventer, Heydekamp, 11 August, 1873. Having been officially recognized as "Catholic Bishop" by <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, 19 September, and having taken the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance, 7 October, 1873, he selected Bonn as his place of residence. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> were granted by <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> an annual sum of 4800 Marks ($1200). <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Reinkens by name, 9 November, 1873; previous to which, in the spring of 1872, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a> had been <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> Hilgers, Langen, Reusch, and Knoodt, professors of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a>. The same fate had also overtaken several professors at Braunsberg and <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>. The fiction brought forward by Friedrich von Schulte that the <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a> are the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was accepted by several governments in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches were transferred to the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. This was done notwithstanding the fact that a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 17 September, 1871, and a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 12 March, 1873, had again shown that the <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a> had no connection with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church; represented, therefore, a religious <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> entirely separate from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; and consequently could assert no legal claims whatever to the funds or buildings for worship of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The development of the internal organization of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> occupied the congresses held at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in the Breisgau, 1874; at <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, 1876; Baden-Baden, 1880; and Krefeld, 1884; as well as the ordinary <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>. The synodal constitution, adopted at the urgency of von Schulte, seems likely to lead to the ruin of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. It has resulted in unlimited arbitrariness and a radical break with all the disciplinary ordinances of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Especially far-reaching was the abolition of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, called forth by the lack of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. After the repeal of this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> a number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who were tired of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, none of whom were of much <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> importance, took refuge among the <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a>. The statute of 14 June, 1878, for the maintenance of discipline among the Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, has merely theoretical value. A <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> fund, a pension fund, and a supplementary fund for the incomes of <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> have been formed, thanks to the aid given by governments and private <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. In the autumn of 1877, Bishop Reinkens founded a residential <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students, which, on 17 January, 1894, was recognized by royal cabinet order as a juridical <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> with an endowment of 110,000 Marks ($27,500). A house of studies for gymnasial students called the Paulinum was founded 20 April, 1898, and a residence for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was bought. Besides other periodical publications there is an official church paper. These statements, which refer mainly to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, may also be applied in part to the few communities founded in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, which, however, have never reached any importance. In <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, notwithstanding the very pernicious agitation, acquitted themselves well, so that only three <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="01624b.htm">apostatized</a>. The <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cantons &#151; above all, <a href="02507b.htm">Berne</a>, Basle, and Geneva &#151; did everything possible to promote the movement. An Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, in which two radical <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> lectured, was founded at the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="02507b.htm">Berne</a>. At the same time all the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities organized themselves into a "Christian <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> National Church" in 1875; in the next hear Dr. Herzog was elected <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Dr. Reinkens. Berne was chosen as his place of residence. As in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> so in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> confession was done away with, <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> abolished, and the use of the vernacular prescribed for the service of the altar. Attempts to extend Old Catholicism to other countries failed completely. That lately an <a href="01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> named Arnold Matthew, who for a time was a <a href="15154b.htm">Unitarian</a>, married, then united with another suspended <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> named O'Halloran, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, is not a matter of any importance. Matthew calls himself an Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but has practically no following. Some of the few <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who attend his church in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> do so ignorantly in the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> that the church is genuinely <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.</p>

<p>The very radical <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, disciplinary, and constitutional ordinances adopted in the first fifteen years gradually convinced even the most friendly government officials that the fiction of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of the <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a> was no longer tenable. The damage, however, had been done, the legal recognition remained unchanged, and the grant from the budget could not easily be dropped. In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, although there was no essential change in this particular, yet the political necessity which led to a <em>modus vivendi</em> in the <a href="08703b.htm"><em>Kulturkampf</em></a> chilled the interest of statesmen in <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a>, particularly as the latter had not been able to fulfil their promise of nationalizing the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The utter failure of this attempt was due to the solidarity of the <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In many cases entire <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> returned to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> after the first excitement had passed, and the winning power of the Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement declined throughout <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the same degree as that in which the <a href="08703b.htm"><em>Kulturkampf</em></a> powerfully stimulated genuine <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> feeling. The number of <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a> sank rapidly and steadily; to conceal this the leaders of the movement made use of a singular device. Up to then <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a> had called themselves such, both for the police registry and for the census. They were now directed by their leaders to cease this and to call themselves simply <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The rapid decline of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> has thus been successfully concealed, so that it is not possible at the present day to give fairly exact statistics. The designation of themselves as <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a> is all the stranger as in essential doctrines and worship they hardly differ from a liberal form of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. However, the prescribed concealment of membership in the Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body had this much good in it, that many who had long been secretly estranged from the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> were able to return to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> without attracting attention. On account of these circumstances only Old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> statistics of some years back can be given. In 1878 there were in the German empire: 122 congregations, including 44 in <a href="02194a.htm">Baden</a>, 36 in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, 34 in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and about 52,000 members; in 1890 there were only about 30,000 <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a> on account of a decided decline in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. In 1877 there were in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> about 73,000; in 1890 only about 25,000. In <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> at the most flourishing period there were perhaps at the most 10,000 adherents, today there are probably not more than 4000. It may be said that the total number of <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a> in the whole of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> is not much above 40,000.</p>

<p>It seems strange that a movement carried on with so much <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> vigour and one receiving such large support from the State should from bad management have gone to pieces thus rapidly and completely, especially as it was aided to a large degree in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> by a violent attack upon <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The reason is mainly the predominant influence of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> under whose control the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were placed by the synodal constitution. The abrogation of compulsory <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> showed the utter instability and lack of moral foundation of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> repeatedly but vainly uttered warnings against all these destructive measures. In general he held back from any active participation in the congresses and <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>. This reserve frequently irritated the leaders of the movement, but <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> never let himself be persuaded to screen with his name things which he considered in the highest degree pernicious. He never, however, became reconciled to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, notwithstanding the many efforts made by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>. All things considered, Old Catholicism has practically ceased to exist. It is no longer of any public importance.</p>

Mein Worken als Rechtsleher, mein Anteil and der Politik in Kirche und Staat (giessen, 1908); VERING, Kirchenrecht (3rd ed., 1893), gives a good summary based on the original authorities. Besides the statements in the statistical year-books there is a good account of Old Catholicism in MACCAFFREY, History of the Catholic Church in the Nineteenth Century. 1789-1909, I (Dublin and Waterford, 1909); MARSHALL, D&ouml;llinger and the Old Catholics in Amer. Cath. Quart. Review (Philadelphia, 1890), 267 sqq.; cf. Also files of the London Taablet and Dublin Review (1870-71); Bruck-Kissling, Geschicte der katholischen Kirche im neunzehnten Jahrhundert (Munster, 1908); MAJUNKE, Geschicte des Kulturkampfes in Preussen-Deutchland (Paderborn, 1882); GRANDERATH-KIRCH, Geschicte des Vatikanischen Konzils (Freiburg, 1903-06); cf. also Friedrich, Geschicte des Vatikanischen Konzils (Bonn, 1877-87); in addition, the very full polemical literature of 1868-72 concerning the council and the question of Infallibility should be examined. The most important writings are briefly mentioned in the works just mentioned. The two biographies, from opposing points of view, of Dollinger by FRIEDRICH (Munich, 1891-1901) and MICHAEL (Innsbruck, 1892) contain much valuable material.</p></div>
