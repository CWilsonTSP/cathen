<p>King and <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>; b., probably, 605; d. 5 Aug., 642; the second of seven brothers, sons of Ethelfrid, who was grandson of Ida, founder of the Kingdom of Northumbria in 547. Oswald's mother was Acha, daughter of Ella or Alla, who, after Ida's death, had seized Deira and thus separated it from the Northern Bernicia. The years of Oswald's youth were spent at home, as long as his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> reigned, but when, in 617, Ethelfrid was slain in battle by Redwald, King of the East Angles, Oswald with his brothers fled for protection from Edwin, their uncle, Acha's brother, to the land of the Scots and were cared for at Columba's Monastery at Hii, or <a href="08090a.htm">Iona</a>. There they remained until Edwin's death in the battle of Heathfield (633). Eanfrid, his elder brother, then returned to accept the Kingdom of Deira, whilst Osric, cousin of Edwin, received Bernicia. The kingdom was thus again divided and both parts relapsed into <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>. In the following year Osric was slain in battle, and Eanfrid treacherously <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the British king, Cadwalla. Oswald thereupon came down from the North, and in 635 a small but resolute band gathered round him near the Roman Wall at a spot seven miles north of <a href="07318b.htm">Hexham</a>, afterwards known as Hevenfelt, or <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven's</a> Field. Here, encouraged by a vision and promise of victory from St. Columba, who shrouded with his mantle all his camp, Oswald set up a cross of wood as his standard &#151; the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> symbol ever raised in Bernicia &#151; and gave battle to the Britons, who were led, probably, by Cadwalla. The Britons were completely routed, and thenceforth could only act on the defensive.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Oswald's victory reunited the Northumbrian Kingdom not only because he delivered it from the humiliating yoke of the Mercians and Britons, but also because on his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> side he was a descendant of Ida of Bernicia and on his mother's of the royal house of Ella of Deira. Thus united, Northumbria could not fail to become the chief power in a confederation against Penda of Mercia and the Britons of <a href="15532a.htm">Wales</a>. Oswald was thoroughly grounded in the principles of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, and, though but twelve nobles with whom he returned from exile were <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, far from abandoning his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, his first care was to spread it among the Bernicians, thus confirming the political union effected by Edwin with a religious union unknown before. Edwin, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, had himself received the Faith in 627, through the influence of his wife Ethelburga, sister of the Kentish King, who had brought St. Paulinus to the North, but his example was followed only by the people of Deira. Oswald, brought up in Columba's <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="08090a.htm">Iona</a>, naturally looked to the North for missionaries. The first preacher who set forth soon returned, having found the Northumbrian people too barbarous and stubborn. Then Aidan was sent, "a man of singular meekness, piety and moderation", who established his <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at <a href="09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, in 635. Oswald's <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> co-operation with the monk-bishop soon filled the land with churches and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the church at <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, begun by Edwin, was completed. Moreover, his wonderful <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> in the midst of success, his charity, and his <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> soon had their effect in turning his subjects from Woden to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. We are told that the king in his Court acted as the interpreter of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> missionaries who <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> not the language of his thanes.</p>

<p>It was Oswald's work to add to the warlike glory of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> Ethelfrid and the wise administration of his uncle Edwin the moral power of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and to build up a great kingdom. Edwin had gathered the whole English race into one political body and was overlord of every English kingdom save that of Kent. The <a href="02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (III, 6) says that Oswald had a greater dominion than any of his ancestors, and that "he brought under his sway all the nations and provinces of Britain, which are divided into four languages, namely the Britons, the Picts, the Scots, and the English". He had great power in the North-West, as far south as Chester and Lancashire, and was probably owned as overlord by the <a href="15532a.htm">Welsh</a> Kingdom of Strath Clyde, as well as by the Picts and Scots of Dalriada. In the East he was supreme in Lindsey, and the words of <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a> seem to imply that he was overlord of Mercia, which was still ruled by Penda; but this could have been scarcely more than nominal. The West Saxons in the South, influenced by the fear of Penda, readily acknowledged Oswald, their allegiance being strengthened, in 635, by the conversion of King Cynegils, of Wessex, at whose <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> Oswald stood sponsor, and whose daughter he married. Both sovereigns then established Bishop Birinus at <a href="05133c.htm">Dorchester</a>.</p>

<p>This vast supremacy, extending from north to south, and broken only by Penda's kingdom in Mid-Britain and that of the East Angles, led <a href="01135c.htm">Adamnan of Hii</a> to call Oswald "The Emperor of the whole of Britain". <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> seemed to be forming a network round the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> Penda of Mercia. The kingdom of the East Angles, which was still <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but acknowledged Penda as overlord, was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to Oswald to maintain the connection between his dominions in the north and the south. War was therefore inevitable. At the battle of Maserfeld, said to be seven miles from <a href="13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, "on the border of <a href="15532a.htm">Wales</a>, near Offa's dyke", Oswald was slain on 5 Aug., 642, and thus perished "the most powerful and most Christian King" in the eighth year of his reign and in the flower of his age. His last words were for the spiritual welfare of his soldiers, whence the proverb: "God have mercy on their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, as said Oswald when he fell." His body was mutilated by Penda, and his limbs set up on stakes, where they remained a full year, until they were taken away by Oswy and given to the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> at Bardney in Lindsey. In the tenth century some of the bones were carried off by Ethelred and Ethelfleda of Mercia to St. Peter's, Gloucester. His head was taken from the battlefield to the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter in the royal fortress at Bamborough, and was afterwards translated to <a href="09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, where, for fear of the Danes, it was placed in 875 in the coffin of <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>, which found its resting place at <a href="05211a.htm">Durham</a> in 998. It was in the coffin at the translation of <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> in 1104, and was thought to be there when the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> was opened in 1828. His arm and hand (or hands) were taken to Bamborough and perhaps afterwards removed to <a href="11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>, and were still incorrupt in the time of Symeon of <a href="05211a.htm">Durham</a>, early in the twelfth century. Reginald gives an account of his personal appearance: arms of great length and power, eyes bright blue, hair yellow, face long and <a href="02362a.htm">beard</a> thin, and his small lips wearing a kindly smile.</p>
