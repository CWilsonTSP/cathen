<p>First <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, <a href="14157a.htm">South Carolina</a>, U.S.A.; b. 23 September, 1786, in <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; d. at <a href="03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, 11 April, 1842. He was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a> until his fifteenth year, was then taught privately for two years, and entered Carlow College, 31 August, 1803. In his nineteenth year he began to deliver <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instructions in the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> and <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> instructed the soldiers in garrison at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>. He also established a <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> reformatory together with male and <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> poor <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. Out of these <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> grew the Presentation Convent. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, 10 October, 1809, and was appointed lecturer at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Wherever he preached people thronged to hear him. Pending the opening of the <a href="09524a.htm">Magdalen</a> Asylum he maintained and ministered to many applicants. In the same year he published the "Religious Repertory", established a circulating <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> in the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Mary, Shandon, and attended the city jail. In the elections of 1812 he fearlessly exerted his influence, maintaining that, "in vindicating the political <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of his countrymen, he was but asserting their liberty of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>". In the same year he was appointed president of the new <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> College of St. Mary, where he taught <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In 1814 he vigorously and successfully assailed with tongue and pen the insidious Veto measure which threatened disaster to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Next to O'Connell's his influence was the greatest in the agitation which culminated in Catholic Emancipation. To help this cause he founded "The Chronicle" which he continued to edit until he left <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. in 1817 he was appointed <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Bandon. (The bigotry and prejudice of this city at that time may be conjectured from the inscription over its gates: "Turk, <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> or <a href="02040a.htm">Atheist</a> may enter here, but not a Papist.") In spite of the prejudices which he found there, he soon conciliated men of every <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> and party.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03630a.htm">Charleston</a> at <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, 21 Sept., 1820, and refused to take the customary <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> Government, declaring his intention to become a citizen of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> as soon as possible. He arrived in Charleston 30 Dec., 1820. Conditions were most uninviting and unpromising in the new diocese, which consisted of the three States of South Carolina, <a href="11108a.htm">North Carolina</a>, and Georgia. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were scattered in little groups over these States. The meagre number in Charleston consisted of very poor immigrants from <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and ruined refugees from <a href="13463a.htm">San Domingo</a> and their servants. In 1832, after twelve years of labour, Bishop England estimated the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> at eleven thousand <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>: 7500 in <a href="14157a.htm">South Carolina</a>, 3000 in <a href="06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, and 500 in <a href="11108a.htm">North Carolina</a>. South Carolina was settled as a royal province by the Lords Proprietors, who brought with them the religion of the Established Church, and it was only in 1790 that enactments imposing religious disabilities were expunged from the constitution of the new State. Religious and social antecedents and traditions, and the resultant public opinion, were unfavourable, if not antagonistic, to the growth of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The greatest need was a sufficient number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. This sparsely settled section, with scattered and impoverished congregations, had not heretofore attracted many men of signal merit and ability. Bishop England faced these unfavourable conditions in a <a href="06147a.htm">brave</a> and determined spirit. The day after his arrival he assumed formal charge of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, and almost immediately issued a pastoral and set out on his first visitation of the three States comprising his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. No <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> could be more regular and constant in these visitations. He went wherever he heard there was a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, organized the scattered little flocks, ministered to their spiritual needs, appointed <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> to teach <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a>, and wherever possible urged the building of a church. During these visitations he preached in halls, court houses, State houses, and in <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> and churches of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>, sometimes at the invitation of the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>. When in Charleston he preached at least twice every Sunday and delivered several courses of lectures besides various addresses on special occasions. He successfully advocated before the Legislature of South Carolina the granting of a charter for his <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> corporation, which had been strongly opposed through the machinations of the disaffected trustees. In 1826 he delivered, by invitation, an eloquent discourse before the Congress of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. It was the first time a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> was so <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a>. He was chiefly instrumental in having the First <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> convened, and pending this, formulated a constitution for his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> defining its relations to civil and canon law. This was incorporated by the State and adopted by the several congregations. He also organized conventions of representative <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> in each of the States in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to meet annually. In 1840 these were merged into one general convention. He held a synod of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 21 Nov., 1831, and in 1832 established a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> and college under the name of "The Philosophical and Classical Seminary of Charleston", hoping with the income from the collegiate department to maintain the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Notwithstanding his many and varied <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> he devoted himself to this institution as teacher of classics and professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Organized bigotry soon assailed it, reducing the attendance from one hundred and thirty to thirty; but he continued and it became the alma mater of many eminent <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> and apostolic <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. In the words of Chancellor Kent, "Bishop <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> revived classical learning in South Carolina". In 1822 he organized and incorporated a Book Society to be established in each congregation, and in the same year his indefatigable energy and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> led him to establish the "United States Catholic Miscellany", the first distinctively <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper published in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. It continued to be published until 1861 and is a treasury of instructive and edifying reading. He also compiled a <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a> and prepared a new edition of the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> in English with an explanation of the Mass. He was an active member of the Philosophical Society of <a href="03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, assisted in organizing the Antiduelling Society, and strenuously opposed Nullification in a community where it was vehemently advocated. His intense loyalty to his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> led him into several controversies which he conducted with a dignity and charity that commanded the respect of his opponents and elicited touching tributes from some of them at his death.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1830 he established in Charleston the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy "to <a href="05295b.htm">educate</a> <a href="15687b.htm">females</a> of the middling class of <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>; also to have a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for free colored girls, and to give religious instruction to <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> slaves ; they will also devote themselves to the service of the sick". Subsequently their scope was enlarged, and branch houses were established at <a href="13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, <a href="15646c.htm">Wilmington</a>, and Sumter. In 1834 he further promoted <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and charity by the introduction of the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. In 1835 Rt. Rev. William Clancy arrived from <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> as the coadjutor of Bishop England, but, after a year's dissatisfied sojourn, he requested and obtained a transfer to another field. Bishop England had originally asked for the appointment of the <a href="04564a.htm">Rev. Dr. Paul Cullen</a>, then <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="08157a.htm">Irish College</a>, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (afterwards the first <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>), as his coadjutor.</p>

<p>A striking phase of Bishop <a href="05445a.htm">England's</a> apostolic character was manifested in his spiritual care of the <a href="12627a.htm">negroes</a>. He celebrated an early Mass in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for them every <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> and preached to them at this Mass and at a Vesper service. He was accustomed to deliver two afternoon sermons; if unable to deliver both, he would disappoint the rich and cultured who flocked to hear him, and preach to the poor <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> Africans. In the epidemics of those days he exhibited great devotion to the sick, while his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> volunteered their services in the visitations of cholera and yellow fever. His personal poverty was pitiable. He was known to have walked the streets of <a href="03630a.htm">Charleston</a> with the bare soles of his feet to the ground. Several times the excessive fatigue and exposure incurred in his visitations and ministrations prostrated him, and more than once he was in danger of death. Twice he visited <a href="07114a.htm">Hayti</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>. In 1823 he was asked to take charge of East Florida and, having been given the powers of <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, made a visitation of that territory.</p>

<p>In the interests of his impoverished diocese he visited the chief towns and cities of the Union, crossed the ocean four times, sought aid from the Holy Father, the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, the Leopoldine Society of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and made appeals in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, wherever he could obtain money, vestments, or books. After <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, in 1841, he visited <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> for the last time. On the long and boisterous return voyage there was much sickness, and he became seriously ill through his constant attendance on others. Though very weak, notwithstanding, on his arrival in Philadelphia, he preached seventeen nights consecutively, also four nights in <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. With his health broken and his strength almost exhausted, he promptly resumed his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> on his return to Charleston, where he died, sincerely mourned by men of every creed and every party. His <a href="15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, saintly life, exalted character, profound learning, and matchless eloquence made him a model for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and an ornament of his order.</p>

<p>Most of his writings were given to the public through the columns of the "United States Catholic Miscellany", in the publication of which he was aided by his sister, a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> of many-sided ability and talents. His successor, Bishop Reynolds, collected his various writings, which were published in five volumes at <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, in 1849. A new edition, edited by Archbishop S.B. Messm&icirc;r of <a href="10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, was published at <a href="04055a.htm">Cleveland</a> in 1908.</p>
