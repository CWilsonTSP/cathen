<p>(S. A<font size=-2>NDREAE ET</font> E<font size=-2>DINBURGENSIS</font>). Archdiocese.</p>

<p>The exact <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the foundation of the See of St. Andrews is, like any others in the earliest history of the Scottish Church, difficult, if not impossible, to fix. That there were <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the country now called <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and exercising <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the district where the city of St. Andrews afterwards arose, as early as the eighth or ninth century, is practically certain. We may, however, take 908, the year of the famous assembly at the Moot hill of Scene, as that in which a <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Andrews (Cellach) first appears in history, vowing, in association with the king (Constantine), to "protect the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and discipline of the Faith, and the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the churches and of the Gospel". In the two most ancient and authentic lists that have come down to us, those given by <a href="15724a.htm">Wyntoun</a>, Prior of Lochleven, and by Bower of Inchcolm in his "Scotichronicon", Cellach is called the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Andrews. For two centuries the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> bore Celtic names &#151; Fothad, Maelbrigd, Maelduin, and the like. The death of Fothad II (1093) marks the close of the first period of the history of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, of which scanty records and still scantier material traces remain. The English influence on Scottish national life, both <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil, which followed the marriage of St. Margaret, great-niece of Edward the Confessor, to the King of Scots in 1069, had as one of its results the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of Turgot (Margaret's former confessor) to the See of St. Andrews. He was succeeded by Eadmer, a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; and Eadmer by Robert, a <a href="03288a.htm">canon regular of St. Augustine</a>, who founded at St. Andrews in 1144 the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> for canons of his own order.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It was his successor Arnold who began, at the eastern end, the construction of the magnificent <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the building of which occupied more than a century and a half. Meanwhile the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of St. Andrews, although they claimed and exercised (as their Celtic predecessors had done) the right of presiding at all assemblies of the Scottish <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, had never been formally granted the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> primacy: indeed in 1225 their position was seriously affected by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, enjoining that future <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were to be presided over by one of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, styled the <em>Conservator</em>, to be elected by his brother <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>. This arrangement, which of course deprived the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of St. Andrews of their quasi-primatial <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, remained in force until the subsequent erection of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> into an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>.</p>

<p>It was William Lamberton, the twenty-third <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, who had the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of seeing the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> completed, and solemnly <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in presence of King Robert Bruce on 5 July, 1318. The building was 355 feet in length, and consisted of a <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> of twelve bays with <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a>, north and south <a href="15018a.htm">transepts</a>, each of three bays, with eastern <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a>, choir of five bays with <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a>, and presbytery. Sixty years after the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> it was partly destroyed by fire, but was completely restored before 1440. Bishop Lamberton built the beautiful <a href="03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, which still exists, though roofless. Among Lamberton's most eminent successors were Henry Wardlaw, who founded the University of St. Andrews in 1411, James Kennedy, founder of St. Salvator's College, and Patrick Graham (Kennedy's half-brother), who successfully resisted the claim revived by Archbishop Neville of York to have the supremacy of that see over the Scottish Church recognized in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. So successful was Graham's protest, that <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> finally decided the question by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, 27 August, 1472, erecting the See of St. Andrews into an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, and its <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> into the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church for the whole of <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. Twelve sees were assigned to St. Andrews as its suffragans, those of <a href="06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, <a href="05193a.htm">Dunkeld</a>, <a href="01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a>, Moray, Brechin, Dunblane, <a href="13201a.htm">Ross</a>, Caithness, Orkney, Argyll, the Isles, and <a href="06370a.htm">Galloway</a>. The last-named <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> had hitherto been subject to <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, while those of Orkney, Argyll, and the Isles had continued to form part of the Province of <a href="15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a> in <a href="11117b.htm">Norway</a>. <a href="14032b.htm">Pope Sixtus</a> announced the new creation in letters addressed to James III and to the Scottish <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and he also conferred on the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> the office of <a href="11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a>. The new <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="10244c.htm">see</a>, however, preserved its unique position for barely twenty years.</p>

<p>Scotland was unanimous in demanding &#151; through its king, its chancellor, and its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; that the ancient See of <a href="06577b.htm">Glasgow</a> should be similarly <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a>; and in 1492 <a href="08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> erected it also into an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> and separate province, with Dunkeld, Dunblane, <a href="06370a.htm">Galloway</a>, and Argyll as suffragans. In 1496 James IV procured the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> to St. Andrews first of his brother, the Duke of <a href="13201a.htm">Ross</a>, and, after his death (by an abuse too common in those times), of his own natural son, Alexander Stuart, a boy of sixteen. The youthful <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> fell at Flodden in 1513, fighting by his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> side. He was followed successively by <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Forman, <a href="02374a.htm">James</a> and <a href="02372a.htm">David (Cardinal) Beaton</a>, and <a href="07123a.htm">Hamilton</a>. At the period immediately preceding the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and the spoliation of the ancient Church, the <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> included two archdeaconries, nine rural deaneries, the patronage of 131 <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and the administration of 245 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Archbishop Hamilton was hanged at Stirling (in his pontifical vestments) on 5 April, 1571; and though the few remaining members of his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter duly elected Robert Hay as his successor, he was never <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and the See of St. Andrews remained <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> for three hundred and seven years.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>For nearly a century the scattered <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the former archdiocese were under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the English prefects and <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>; but in 1653 a prefect of the Scottish Mission (William Ballantyne) was appointed by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Forty years later the first <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> for <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (Bishop Nicholson) was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The country was divided into two vicariates in 1726, a Highland and a Lowland, and just a hundred years later <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> added a third, the Eastern, including the whole of the former Archdiocese of St. Andrews. At length, on 4 March, 1878, the regular <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was restored by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Diocese of St. Andrews and Edinburgh as defined in the Apostolic Letter "Ex Supremo Apostolatus Apice" of 4 March 1878, comprises the counties of <a href="05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, Berwick, Fife (southern part), Haddington, Linlithgow, Peebles, Roxburgh, Selkirk and (practically) Stirlingshire. The entire population of this portion of <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, according to the latest census, amounts to nearly 870,000, and the number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is estimated at 63,000, or about seven per cent of the whole. The number of churches, <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> and stations at the beginning of 1911 was 87, and of missions 51, served by eight <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and four <a href="11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>. The last-named order has one house in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> two. orders of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> in the diocese comprise <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> of the Incarnation (whose <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, founded Edinburgh in 1835, was the first established in <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a> since the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>); <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> (two houses); <a href="12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>; Sisters of the Immaculate Conception; Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent of Paul, (four houses); Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary; <a href="12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>; Helpers of the Holy Souls. Religious of Marie R&eacute;paratrice; <a href="03610a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Paul</a> (two houses); <a href="07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>; <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>; and <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions are, a children's refuge, industrial <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> and boy's <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for girls, House of Mercy for servants, home for working boys, Sacred Heart Home for penitents, dispensary and home for respectable girls, convalescent home, and St. Vincent's Home for destitute Children. The number of congregational day-schools is fifty, and the average attendance of children at them between 10,000 and 11,000. The great majority of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> (certainly over 90 per cent) are of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> origin and parentage; of the remainder many are <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a>, (chiefly from <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>), Poles, and Lithuanians, the latter engaged for the most part as miners. The Poles tend to become absorbed in the native population, usually discarding their Polish names. The material progress in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in the way of church building, has been noteworthy in recent years. In 1859 there was one church in the capital; half a century later there were eight; and churches have been built in different parts of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> of considerable <a href="05257a.htm">architectural</a> merit. Several of them being the finest <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> edifices in their respective towns. The archi-episcopal residence is in <a href="05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, where is also the old <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Andrews was wrecked by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> mob (<a href="08680a.htm">Knox's</a> "rascal multitude") in 1559; and though efforts were made by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> Spottiswoode and others to restore it, it became a total ruin. Nothing now remains of it but the south wall of the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a>, a fragment of the beautiful west front, the eastern gable with its flanking turrets, portions of the <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a> and some pier bases. The present <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is the Most Rev. James A.
