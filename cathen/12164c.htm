<p>A canonical term applied to various kinds of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>. The word itself, derived from the Latin <em>plenarium</em> (complete or full), indicates that the council to which the term is applied (<em>concilium plenarium, concilium plenum</em>) represents the whole number of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of some given territory.</p>

<p>Whatever is complete in itself is plenary. The ecumenical councils or <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of the Universal Church are called plenary council by <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (C. illa, xi, Dist. 12), as they form a compete representation of the entire Church. Thus also, in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> documents, <a href="12515a.htm">provincial councils</a> are denominated plenary, because all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a certain <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> were represented. Later usage has restricted the term plenary to those councils which are presided over by a delegate of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, who has received special power for that purpose, and which are attended by all the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of some commonwealth, empire, or kingdom, or by their duly accredited representatives. Such plenary <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> are frequently called national councils, and this latter term has always been in common use among the English, Italian, French, and other peoples.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>I. Plenary councils, in the sense of <a href="14389a.htm">national synods</a>, are included under the term particular councils as opposed to <a href="04423f.htm">universal councils</a>. They are of the same nature as <a href="12515a.htm">provincial councils</a>, with the accidental difference that several ecclesiastical provinces are represented in national or plenary <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>. <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial councils</a>, strictly so-called, date from the fourth century, when the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitical</a> authority had become fully developed. But <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, approaching nearer to the modern signification of a plenary council, are to be recognized in the synodical assemblies of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> under <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a>, exarchal, or patriarchal authority, recorded from the fourth and fifth centuries, and possibly earlier. Such were, apparently, the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> held in <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> at <a href="07619a.htm">Iconium</a> and Synnada in the third century, concerning the re-baptism of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>; such were, certainly, the councils held later in the northern part of Latin Africa, presided over by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Africa. The latter councils were offically designated plenary council (<em>Concilium Plenarium totius Africae</em>). Their beginnings are without <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> to be referred, at least, to the fourth, and possibly to the third century. Synods of a somewhat similar nature (though approaching nearer to the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>) were the <a href="01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> in Gaul in 314 (at which were present the Bishops of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, and Caerleon), and the <a href="13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> in 343 (whose canons were frequently cited as Nicene canons). To these we might add the <a href="04311b.htm">Greek Council in Trullo (692)</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> were accustomed in former ages to hold <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> which were designated <em>Councils of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a></em>. They might be denominated, to a certain extent, emergency <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, and though they were generally composed of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, yet <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of other ecclesiastical provinces took part in them. <a href="09723c.htm">Pope Martin I</a> held such a council in 649, and <a href="01204c.htm">Pope Agatho</a> in 680. These <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were imitated by the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Constantinople who convoked, on special occasions, a <em>synodus endemousa</em>, at which were present <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> from various provinces of the <a href="03096a.htm">Greek world</a> who happened to be sojourning in the imperial city, or were summoned to give council to the emperor or the patriarch concerning matters that required special episcopal consultation. Still further narrowed down to our present <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of plenary council are the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> convoked in the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> and <a href="15476b.htm">West-Gothic</a> kingdoms from the end of the sixth century, and designated national councils. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in these <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were not gathered together because they belonged to certain ecclesiastical provinces, but because they were under the same civil government, and consequently had common interests which concerned the kingdom in which they lived or the people over whom they ruled.</p>

<p>II. As <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who presides over a plenary or <a href="14389a.htm">national synod</a>, this name has been refused to the assemblies of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, which met without <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authorization in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These <em>comitia cleri Gallicani</em> were not really plenary council. The more noted among them were those held at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1681 and 1682 (Collect. Lacens., I, 793 sq.). Convocations of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> (<em>Assembl&eacute;es du Clerge</em>) were frequent in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> before the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution of 1789</a>. They consisted of certain <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> deputed by the various ecclesiatical provinces of the kingdom, and of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> elected by their equals from the same provinces, to deliberate on the temporal affairs of the French churches, and more particularly on the assistance, generally monetary, to be accorded to the Government. After the establishment of the empire, <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> held a great convention of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and is said to have been much incensed because <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> did not designate it a national council (Coll. Lacens., VI, 1024). Similarly, mere congresses of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, even of a whole nation, who meet to discuss common <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, without adhering to synodal forms, are not to be called national or plenary Councils, because no one having the proper <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> has formally summoned them to a canonical synod. Such episcopal conventions have been praised by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, because they showed unity among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for asserting the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the progress of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause in their midst, in accordance with the sacred canons (Coll. Lacens., V, 1336), but, as the requisite legal forms and proper hierarchical authority are wanting, these congresses of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> do not constitute a plenary council, no matter how full the representation of episcopal dignitaries may be.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>III. A plenary or national council may not be convoked or celebrated without the authority of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, as was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> and repeatedly declared by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (Coll. Lacens., V, 995, 1336). This has always been the practice in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, if not explicitly, at least from the fact that recourse could always be had to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> against decisions of such councils. Now, however, express and special <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authorization is required. He who presides over the council must have the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, which is accorded by special Apostolic delegation. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, the presidency of such <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> has always been accorded by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. In their case, a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> delegation is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, for although they have a precedence of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> over all the other American <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, yet they have no <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> or patriarchal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. It is not uncommon for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to send from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> a special delegate to preside over plenary council.</p>

<p>IV. Summons to a national or plenary council is to be sent to all <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the nation, and they are <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to appear, unless prevented by a canonical hindrance; to all <a href="01143a.htm">administrators of dioceses</a> <em>sede plena</em> or <em>vacua</em>, and to <a href="15401c.htm">vicars capitular</a> <em>sede vacante</em>; to <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> possessed of episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; to the representatives of <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters, to <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> having quasi-episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, custom has sanctioned the summoning of auxiliary, coadjutor, and visiting <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; <a href="12514b.htm">provincials</a> of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; all mitred <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>; rectors of major <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, as well as <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to serve as theologians and canonists.</p>

<p>V. Only those who have a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to a summons have also a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to cast a decisive vote in councils. The others may give only a consultive vote. The fathers may, however, empower auxiliary, coadjutor, and visiting <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as well as <a href="12451a.htm">procurators</a> of absent <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to cast a decisive vote. The <a href="02235a.htm">Third Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> allowed a decisive vote also to a general of a religious congregation, because this was done at the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. At the latter council, however, such vote was granted only to generals of regular orders, but not to those of religious congregations (<a href="11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, part I, p. 127). At <a href="02235a.htm">Baltimore</a>, a decisive vote was refused to <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> of a single <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but conferred on arch-abbots.</p>

<p>VI. In particular councils, the subject-matter to be treated is what concerns discipline, the reformation of abuses, the repression of crimes, and the progress of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. In former times, such councils often condemned incipient <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> and opinions contrary to sound <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, but their decisions became dogmatic only after solemn confirmation by the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. Thus, the Councils of <a href="10304b.htm">Milevis</a> and Carthage condemned <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, and the Council of Orange (Arausicanum) <a href="13703a.htm">Semipelagianism</a>. Such latitude is not allowed to modern <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, and the Fathers are warned, moreover, that they are not to restrict opinions which are tolerated by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>VII. Decrees of plenary council must be submitted, before <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, for the confirmation, or rather recognition and revision of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Such recognition does not imply an approval of all the regulations submitted by the council, and still less of all the assertions contained in the synodal acts. Many things are merely tolerated by the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> for the time being. The submission to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> is mainly for the correction of what is too severe or inaccurate in the decrees. Bishops have the power of relaxing decrees of a plenary council in particular cases in their own <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, unless the council was confirmed <em>in forma specifica</em> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In like manner, when no specific confirmation of the decrees has been accorded, it is lawful to appeal from these councils. In modern times, it is not unusual for the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to confirm councils <em>in forma specifica</em>, but only to accord them the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> recognition. If, consequently, anything be found in their acts contrary to the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, it would have no binding force unless a special apostolic derogation were made in its favour. Mere recognition and revision would not suffice.</p>
