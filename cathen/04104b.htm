<p>The offerings of the faithful in their special relation to the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a> will claim fuller and more general treatment under <a href="11217a.htm">O<font size=-2>FFERTORY</font></a> and <a href="10006a.htm">M<font size=-2>ASS</font></a> (Pt. B, &#167;(1), (c); text p. 20). We will confine ourselves here to the particular development which took the form of a contribution in money, corresponding particularly to what is conveyed by the <a href="06190a.htm">French</a> word <em>qu&#234;te</em>. Of collections for general church purposes we find mention already in the days of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, for we read in <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 16:1-2</a>: "Now concerning the collections that are made for the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also. On the <a href="14335a.htm">first day of the week</a> let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him; that when I come, the collections be not then to be made." This seems to imply that on every <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> (the <a href="14335a.htm">first day of the week</a>) contributions were made, probably when the faithful assembled for "the breaking of bread" (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs7">Acts 20:7</a>), and that then contributions were put by, if not required for some immediate and local need, e.g. the relief of the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, in order that <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> might assign them for the use of other more destitute churches at a distance (cf. <a href="../bible/2co008.htm">2 Corinthians 8</a> and <a href="../bible/2co009.htm">9</a>). How far such offerings were allocated to the support of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and how far to the poor there is nothing to tell us, but it is plain that as a matter of principle the claims both of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of the poor were recognized from the very first. (For the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> see <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 9:8-11</a>; <a href="../bible/2th003.htm#vrs8">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs17">1 Timothy 5:17-18</a>; and for the poor see <a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs34">Acts 4:34-35</a>, <a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs1">6:1</a>, <a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs29">11:29-30</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs16">1 Timothy 5:16</a>, etc.) Again there can be no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that from an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> such <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> were administered according to some organized system. The very institution of <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> proves this, and we can appeal to the existence in certain places, for example at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, of a <a href="10052a.htm">roll</a> (<em>breve ecclesiasticum,</em> see the recently recovered "Life of St. Melania", &#167; 35) bearing the names of those in receipt of relief. <a href="07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> gives the name of <em>matricularii</em> (De Mirac. B. Martin., iii, 22) to those who were entered on this roll. Speaking generally, the allocation of all offerings was recognized as belonging to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (i.e. in the period before the modern system of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> had evolved itself with any clearness), and the rule was formally enunciated in the West that all offerings were to be divided by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> into four parts: the first for the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the second for the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, the third for the fabric and up-keep of the churches, and the last part for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself, that he might the better exercise the hospitality which was expected of him. This arrangement seems to date back at least to the time of <a href="14002a.htm">Pope Simplicius</a> (475), and a hundred years later it is stated by <a href="06780a.htm">Pope Gregory the Great</a> in the following form when he was consulted by <a href="02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> about the English Church which he had just founded: "It is the custom of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> to deliver to <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> that of every oblation which is made there ought to be four portions, one, to wit, for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his household, on account of hospitality and entertainment, another for the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, a third for the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, a fourth for the repairing of churches" (Bede, Hist. Eccles., I, xxvi).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>At a latter <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> we find some modification of this rule for in the Capitularies of Louis the Pious a third of the offerings are assigned to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and two-thirds to the poor in more prosperous districts, while a half is to be given to each in poorer ones. During all this earlier period offerings in money do not seem to have been connected with the <a href="10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, but they were either put into an alms-box permanently set up in the church or they were given in collections made on certain specified occasions. With regard to the former <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> already speaks (Apol., xxxix, <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., I, 470) of "some sort of chest" which stood in the church and to which the faithful contributed without compulsion. It seems to have been commonly called <em>gazophylacium</em> or <em>corbona</em> (Cyprian, "De op. et eleemos."; <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Ep. xxvii, 14). The collections on the other hand probably took place on days of which notice was given beforehand. Apart from a mention in the "Apology" of <a href="08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> (I, lxvii), from which we should suppose that a collection was made every <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a>, our principal source of information is the series of six sermons "De Collectis", delivered by <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a> in different years of his pontificate (<a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LIV, 158-168). All these, according to the brothers Bullerini, probably have reference to a collection annually made on 6 July, on which day in <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> times certain games were held in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of Apollo, at which a collection took place. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> seems to have continued the custom and converted it into an occastion of <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> for <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> purposes upon the octave day of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. It may be noted that both <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De Jejun., xiii, <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., II, 972) and <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> seem to regard such contributions of money as a form of <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and consequently sanctification, closely connected with <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>. That similar collections were everywhere common in the Early Church and that considerable pressure was sometimes brought to bear to extort contributions we learn from a letter of <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (<a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., LXXVII, 1060).</p>

<p>As already noted, these methods of gathering <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> seem to have had nothing directly to do with the liturgy. The offerings which were invariably made by the faithful during the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> were long confined to simple <a href="01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="01358a.htm">wine</a>, or at least to such things as wax, candles, oil, or <a href="07716a.htm">incense</a> which had a direct relation to the Divine service. According to the so-called <a href="03279a.htm">Apostolic Canons</a> (see <a href="03279a.htm">APOSTOLIC CANONS</a>) other forms of produce which might be offered for the support of the clergy were to be taken to the residence of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, where he lived a sort of community life with his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> (See Funk, Didascalia et Constitutiones Apostolorum, I, 564). However, the <a href="01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="01358a.htm">wine</a> which were brought to the altar at the <a href="11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the Mass were commonly presented in quantities far in excess of what was needed for the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, and they thus formed, and were intended to form, a substantial contribution towards the maintenance of those who served in the sanctuary. Various enactments were passed during the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> period with the object of urging the people to remain faithful to this practice, but it seems gradually to have died out, save in certain functions of solemnity, e.g. the Mass celebrated at the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, when two loaves and two small casks of wine are presented to the celebrant at the <a href="11217a.htm">Offertory</a>. On the other hand, this oblation of <a href="01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="01358a.htm">wine</a> seems to have been replaced in many localities by a contribution in money. At what period the substitution began is not quite clear. Some have thought that a trace of this practice is to be recognized as early as <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> (595) who speaks of the <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> "receiving the money collected from the communion" (Ep. ad Leudof., xii). A less ambiguous example may be found in a letter of <a href="11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> (c. 1050) where there is mention of gold <a href="11152a.htm">coins</a> being offered by the wives of certain princes at his Mass (<a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXLIV, 360). In any case it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that from the twelfth to the fifteenth century a money offering, known in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> as the "mass-penny", was commonly made at the <a href="11217a.htm">Offertory</a> all over the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>. Kings and personages of high rank often had a special coin which they presented at Mass each day and then redeemed it afterwards for a specified sum. <a href="03642b.htm">Chaucer</a> says of his Pardoner:&ndash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Well could he read a lesson or a storie<br>But althebest he sang an offertorye;<br>For well he wyste, when that song was songe,<br>He moste preach and well affyle his tongue<br>To wynne silver, as he right wel cowde.<br>Therefore he sang full merrily and lowde.</p></blockquote>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The offering was <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, and each one brought what he had to give to the altar-rail. Burchard at the beginning of the sixteenth century gives this direction: "If there be any who wish to offer, the celebrant comes to the epistle corner and there standing bareheaded with his left side turned towards the altar, he removes the <a href="09601b.htm">maniple</a> from his left arm and taking it in his right hand, he presents the end of it to <a href="08663a.htm">kiss</a> to those who offer, saying to each: 'May thy sacrifice be acceptable to <a href="06608a.htm">God Almighty</a>', or 'Mayst thou receive a hundredfold and possess eternal life'." This <a href="13216a.htm">rubric</a> was not retained in the first official and authoritative edition of the Roman <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a>, printed in 1570. Possibly the struggle for precedence in going up to make the offering, of which we read in <a href="03642b.htm">Chaucer</a>, tended to bring this method of contributing into disfavour and led to the carrying round of an alms-dish or bag from bench to bench as is commonly done at present. Collections for special objects, e.g. the building of a church, the construction of a bridge, the relief of certain cases of distress, etc. have at all times been common in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the people were constantly stimulated to give more generously to particular funds for <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> purposes, e.g. the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, by the grant of special <a href="07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>. These grants of <a href="07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> were often entrusted to preachers of note ("Pardoners") who carried them from town to town, collecting money and using their eloquence to recommend the good work in question and to enhance the spiritual privileges attached to it. This led to many abuses. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> frankly recognized them and abolished all grants of <a href="07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> which were conditional upon a pecuniary contribution towards a specified object. Other collections during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> were associated with special objects of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>&mdash;for example, noteworthy shrines, <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a>, or <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>. Some few specimens still remain of stone alms-boxes joined to a bracket upon which some <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> formerly stood, or united to <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> sepulchres, shrines, etc. One collection, that for the Holy Places, was commonly associated with the creeping to the Cross on <a href="06643a.htm">Good Fridays</a>, as it still is today.</p>

<p>The strain put upon the charity of the lay-folk in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> by the large number of <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> was often severely felt. Some remedy was provided by confining the appeals of those who solicited <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> to certain assigned districts. The <a href="10183c.htm">mendicants</a> so licensed were in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> often known as "limitours". A like difficulty is not unfamiliar in our own day, and the principle has consequently been recognized that a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to prohibit strangers from collecting <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> without authorization. Although it is not always easy to exercise adequate control over these appeals, a certain check may be put upon importunate <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> by withholding permission to say <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the diocese. This method of exercising pressure, to be followed by complaint to the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> in case such prohibitions are neglected, is indicated in a strongly worded <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> drawn up by the Third <a href="02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (n. 295). Similar regulations requiring that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> authorization should be obtained before strangers can be allowed to collect money for charitable purposes in the diocese also prevail in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Restrictions are further commonly imposed, either by synodal decrees or by the command of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, upon certain methods of collecting money which may be judged according to local circumstances to be likely to give <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> or to be attended with danger to <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. The sometimes intricate and delicate questions arising from the collection of money by religious when entrusted with quasi-parochial functions have been legislated for in the <a href="01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> "Romanos Pontifices" of 8 May, 1881.</p>
