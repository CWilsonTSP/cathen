<h2 id="section1">The league of 1576</h2>

<p>The discontent produced by the Peace of Beaulieu (6 May, 1576), which restored the government of Picardy to the Protestant Prince de Cond&eacute; and gave him P&eacute;ronne to hold as a security, induced d'Humieres, a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who commanded the city of P&eacute;ronne, to form a league of gentry, soldiers, and peasants of Picardy to keep Cond&eacute; from taking possession of the city. D'Humieres also appealed to all the princes, nobles and <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the kingdom, and to the allies of the nations neighbouring to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. This League of P&eacute;ronne thus aspired to become international. From a religious point of view it aimed at supporting <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> politically at restoring the "ancient franchises and liberties" against the royal power. Its programme was spread throughout <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by the efforts of Henri de <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> (see <a href="07074a.htm">G<font size=-2>UISE</font></a>), and Henry III, then on good terms with the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a>, declared himself its chief. <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> was apprised of the formation of the League by Jean David, an advocate of the Parliament of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, acting for the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a>, and he communicated the fact to Philip II. But when the Peace of Bergerac (17 September, 1577) between Henry III and the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, curtailed the liberties accorded them by the Edict of Beaulieu, the king hastened to dissolve the League of P&eacute;ronne and the other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leagues formed after its example. This dissolution was the cause of rejoicing to a certain number of royalists, who held that "all leagues and associations in a monarchial state are matters of grave consequence, and that it is impossible for sujects to band themselves together without prejudicing the royal superiority". The nobility had lacked unanimity, and the cities had been too lukewarm to maintain this first league.</p>

<h2 id="section2">The league of 1585</h2>

<p>The death of the Duke of Anjou (10 June, 1584) having made Henry of Bourbon, the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> King of Navarre, heir presumptive to Henry III, a new league was formed among the aristocracy and the people. On the one hand, the Dukes of <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a>, Mayenne, and Nevers and Baron de Senecey met at <a href="10680a.htm">Nancy</a> to renew the League, with the object of securing the recognition, as heir to the throne, of the Cardinal de Bourbon, who would extirpate <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and receive the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Philip II, by the Treaty of Joinville (31 December, 1584), promised his concurrence, in the shape of a monthly subsidy of 50,000 crowns. At <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, on the other hand, Charles Hotteman, Sieur de Rocheblond, "moved by the Spirit of God", Pr&eacute;vost, cur&eacute; of Saint S&eacute;verin, Boucher, cur&eacute; of Saint Beno&icirc;t, and Launoy, a canon of <a href="14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, appealed to the middle classes of the cities to save <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. A <a href="14071b.htm">secret society</a> was formed. Rocheblond and five other leaguers carried on a propaganda, gradually organizing a little army at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and establishing relations with the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a>. The combination of these two movements &mdash; the aristocratic and the popular &mdash; resulted in the manifesto of 30 March, 1585, launched from P&eacute;ronne by <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> and the princes amounting to a sort of declaration of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against Henry III. The whole story of the League has been told in the article <a href="07074a.htm">G<font size=-2>UISE</font></a>. We shall here dwell upon only the following two points.</p>

<h3 id="A">Relations between the popes and the League</h3>

<p><a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> approved of the League after 1584, but abstained from committing himself to any writing in its favour. <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> wished the struggle against <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to be led by the king himself; the religious <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the Leaguers pleased him, but he did not like the movement of political independence in relation to Henry III. Events, however, drove <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> to take sides with the Leaguers. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 9 September, 1585, by which he declared Henry of Bourbon and the Prince of Cond&eacute; as <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, to have forfeited the succession, provoked so much opposition from the Parliament, and so spirited a reply from Henry, that the League, in its turn, recognized the necessity of a counterstroke. Louis d'Orl&eacute;ans, advocate and a leaguer, undertook the defence of the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> in the "Avertissement des Catholiques Angais aux Fran&ccedil;ais Catholiques", an extremely violent manifesto against Henry of Bourbon. Madame le Montpensier, a sister of the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a>, boasted that she ruled the famous preachers of the League, the "Satire M&eacute;nipp&eacute;e" presently turned them to ridicule, while in their turn the Leaguers from the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpits</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> attacked not only Henry of Bourbon, but the acts, the <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, and the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of Henry III. Such preachers were Rose, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Senlis, Boucher and Pr&eacute;vost, the aforesaid cur&eacute;s &mdash; the latter of whom caused an immense picture to be displayed, representing the horrible sufferings inflicted upon <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the English co-religionists of Henry of Bourbon. Other preachers were de Launay, a canon of <a href="14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, the learned <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> G&eacute;n&eacute;brard, the controversialist Feuardent, the <a href="14613a.htm">ascetic</a> writer Pierre Crespet, and Guincestre, cur&eacute; of Saint-Gervais, who, preaching at Saint-Barth&eacute;lemy on New Year's Day, 1589, made all who heard him take an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to spend the last penny they had and shed their last drop of blood to avenge their assassination of <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a>. By these excesses of the Leaguers against the monarchical principle, and by the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> of Henry III by Jacques Cl&eacute;ment (1 August, 1589) <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> was compelled to assume an altitude of extreme reserve towards the League. The <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> Matteuzzi having thought it his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to leave <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> because immediately after the assassination of Henry III the Senate had decided to send an ambassador to Henry of Bourbon, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> sent him back to his post, expressing a hope that the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> might be able to persuade Henry of Bourbon to be reconciled with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. On 14 May, 1590, the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> Caetani blessed, saluting them as Machabees, the 1300 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who, led by Rose, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Senlis, and Pelletier, Cur&eacute; of Saint-Jacques, organized for the defence of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> against Henry of Bourbon; but, on the other hand, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> manifested great displeasure because the Sorbonne had declared, on 7 May, that, even "absolved of his crimes", Henry of Bourbon could not become King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The Leaguers in their enthusiasm had denied to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority the right of eventually admitting Henry of Bourbon to the throne of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. They found new cause for indignation in the fact that <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> had received the Duke of Luxembourg-Piney, the envoy of Henry's party; and Philip II while in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, caused a sermon to be preached against the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But when, after the brief pontificate of <a href="15218a.htm">Urban VII</a>, <a href="07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a> became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (5 December, 1590) the League and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> recovered their influence at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Several Briefs dated in March, 1591, and two "monitoria" to the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> Landriano once more proclaimed the downfall of Henry of Bourbon. The <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> who sided with Henry, assembled at <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, in September, 1591, protested against the "monitoria" and appealed from them to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> maturer information. The gradual development of a third party weakened the League and hastened the approach of an understanding between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Henry of Bourbon (see <a href="07225a.htm">HENRY IV</a>). Briefly, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> felt a natural sympathy for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> convictions in which the League originated; but, to the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, he would not, in the most tragic moments of his pontificate, compromise himself too far with a movement which flouted the authority of Henry III, the legitimate king; neither would he admit the maxim: "Culpam non p&aelig;nam aufert absolutio peccati" (<a href="01061a.htm">Absolution</a> blots out the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, but not its penalty), in virtue of which certain <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the League claimed that <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>, even if absolved by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, would still be incapable of succeeding to the French throne. By this wise policy, <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus</a> prepared the way far in advance for the reconciliation which he hoped for, and which was to be realized in the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> by <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>.</p>

<h3 id="B">Political doctrines of the League</h3>

<p>Charles Labitte has found it possible to write a book on "La D&eacute;mocratie sous la Ligue". The religious rising of the people soon took shelter behind certain political theories which tended to the revival of <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> political liberties and the limitation of royal absolutism. In 1586 the advocate Le Breton, in a pamphlet for which he was hanged, called Henry III "one of the greatest hypocrites who ever lived", demanded an assembly of the States General from which the royal officers should be excluded, and proposed to restore all their franchises to the cities. Ideas of political autonomy were beginning to take definite shape. The League wished the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to recover those liberties which it possessed before the Concordat of <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, the nobility to regain the independence it enjoyed in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and the cities to be restored to a certain degree of autonomy. After the assassination of <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a>, a crime instigated by Henry III, sixty-six <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the Sorbonne declared that the king's subjects were freed from their <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance and might lawfully take arms, collect money, and defend the Roman religion against the king: the name of Henrv III was erased from the Canon of the Mass and replaced by the "Catholic princes". Boucher, cur&eacute; of Saint-Beno&icirc;t, popularized this opinion of the Sorbonne in his book "De justa Henriei Tertii abdicatione", in which be maintained that Henry III, "as a perjurer, assassin, murderer, a sacrilegious person, patron of heresy, simoniac, magician, impious and damnable", could be deposed by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; that, as "a perfidious waster of the public treasure, a tyrant and enemy of his country", he could be deposed by the people. Boucher declared that a tyrant was a ferocious beast which men were justified at killing. It was under the influence of these theories that upon the assassination of Henry III by Jacques Cl&eacute;ment (1 August, 1589), the mother of the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a> harangued the throng from the altar of the church of the Cordeliers, and glorified the deed of Cl&eacute;ment. These exaggerated <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> served only to justify tyranny, and did not long influence the minds of men. Moreover, the "Declaration" of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> against seditious preachers (September, 1595) and the steps taken at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Cardinal d'Ossat, in 1601, put a stop to the political preachings which the League had brought into fashion. The memory of the excesses committed under the League was afterwards exploited by the legists of the French Crown to combat Roman doctrines and to defend royal absolutism and Gallicanism. But, considering the bases of the League doctrines, it is impossible not to accord them the highest importance in the history of political <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Power, they said, was derived from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> through the people, and they opposed the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>, absolutist, and Gallican <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Divine right and irresponsibility of kings, such as <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> professed and practised; and they also bore witness to the perfect compatibility of the most rigorous Roman <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> with democratic and popular aspirations.</p>

<p>It has been possible to trace certain analogies between the doctrines of the League and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> brochures like Hotman's "Franco-Gallia" and the "Vindici&aelig; contra tyrannos" of Junius Brutus (Duplessis Mornay), published immediately after the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. Indeed, both <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> and Leaguers were then seeking to limit the royal power; but in the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> projects of reform the tendency was to favour the aristocracy, the <em>optimates</em>; they would not allow the mob &mdash; the <em>mediastinus quilibet</em> of whom the "Vindici&aelig;" speak so contemptuously &mdash; any right of resistance against the king; the Leaguers, on the contrary appealed to the democracy. The <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> permitted no uprising of the mere private individual save with "God's special calling"; the Leaguers held that every man was called by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to the defence of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that all men were equal when there was question of repelling the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> or the infidel. Hence, in his work, "Des progres de la r&eacute;volution et de la guerre contre l'&Eacute;glise" <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> felt free to write (1829): "How deeply <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> has impressed <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> with the sentiment of liberty was never more evident than in the days of the League."</p>
