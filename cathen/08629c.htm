<p><a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, b. at <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, in <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 25 Dec., 1811; d. at Burghausen, 13 July, 1877. He was about to enter the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> bureaucracy when, in 1837, the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> conducted by <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> against <a href="05161b.htm">Archbishop Droste-Vischering</a> of Cologne touched Ketteler's religious spirit and led him to resign. In 1841 he studied <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> University, and in 1843 he completed his preparation for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at the Seminary of M&uuml;nster. In 1844 he became a <a href="04570a.htm">curate</a> at Beckum and in 1846 <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of Hopsten in <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. Elected by the District of Tecklenburg und Warendorf to the Frankfurt Parliament in 1848, Ketteler distinguished himself by his broad and discerning intelligence of the social movements of his time. In the oration which he delivered, 21 Sept., 1848, at the funeral of General Auerswald and Prince Lichnowsky, victims of a riot, he exonerated the great body of the German people from responsibility for the crime. At the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (Oct., 1848), one of the first of the great meetings of German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, he offered a toast to "the plain people" and declared that as religion has need of freedom, so has freedom need of religion. Finally, during the <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a> of 1848, he preached at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> two sermons, on the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> theory of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> and on the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="03592a.htm">Christian charity</a>, developing the sociology of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, and demonstrating the manner in which it answered every social need of the times. He became <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Hedwig in <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, Oct., 1849, where <a href="04786b.htm">Bishop Diepenbrock</a> of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> entrusted him with the task of bringing back to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> the famous <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> novelist, <a href="07109a.htm">Ida von Hahn-Hahn</a>. He reorganized the large St. Hedwig Hospital, and for the first time since the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> led a <a href="04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> procession through the streets of <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1849 the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of Professor Schmid as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the canons of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> was rejected by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, to whom Schmid's views were justly an object of suspicion. The chapter after some opposition proposed three names to <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, among them Ketteler's and on 15 March, 1850, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> named him <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. The circumstances of his <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> and its acceptance by the grand-ducal Government of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a> marked a defeat for the Josephist bureaucracy which for twenty-five years had tyrannized over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in all the small states of the <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine. Ketteler immediately inflicted two more defeats upon this bureaucracy: he re-opened in 1851 the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and thereby freed his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> from the influence of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of Giessen, where the State had hitherto required <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> seminarians to study; moreover he called a "concursus" for some vacant rectories without asking the permission of the State. Through his institution of <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> conferences and the introduction of numerous male and <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> congregations, <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> became a model diocese. The Brothers of St. Joseph and the Sisters of Providence, two orders founded by Ketteler, were destined to a larger growth. As to the relations between <a href="14250c.htm">the Church and the State</a> in the Grand Duchy of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, they rested chiefly on the good understanding between Ketteler and Dalwigk, the minister. Their written agreement (1854) was not approved by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which preferred that all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine should act as a unit in their struggle against the legislation which the smaller German states were seeking to impose on all of them. The new agreement, which after a visit to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Ketteler negotiated with Dalwigk (1856), was sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for approval, but was never returned. Until 1870 religious peace was maintained in <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a> through the harmonious relations between the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the minister.</p>

<h2>Religious conflicts in Baden</h2>

<p>Ketteler played a very active part in the difficulties which broke out between the <a href="02194a.htm">Baden</a> government and Archbishop Vicari; he published a <em>brochure</em> defending the latter and a visit of Ketteler's to Karlsruhe, in January, 1854, almost brought about an understanding between Vicari and the Prince Regent of Baden. Bismarck, however, then <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia's</a> plenipotentiary at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a>, exercised such a strong influence over the Baden ministry that the attempted reconciliation failed. In 1865, when the opposition of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to the Baden <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> law caused a severe <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, Ketteler invoked the intervention of Emperor Francis Joseph, and in two pamphlets refuted the formula of Minister Lamey, according to which "law was the public <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> superior to private consciences." After Archbishop Vicari's death (1868) it was again Ketteler who defended against Minister Jolly the electoral right of the Freiburg canons. At Ketteler's suggestion, on the occasion of the eleventh centenary of <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, were inaugurated the conferences of German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; since then they have grown more frequent and are almost annual since 1869. In this way he was the chief promoter of an institution which for the past forty years has greatly aided the cohesion and strength of the German episcopate. During 1864-66 his name was mentioned for the archbishoprics of Posen or Cologne, and Bismarck seemed for a moment to favour the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a>.</p>

<h2>Ketteler as a social reformer</h2>

<p>Ketteler thought that he was not exceeding his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> as a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> when he spoke authoritatively on social questions. In 1848 he believed that social reform had to begin with the interior regeneration of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. Later he was to enter more deeply into economical problems. When about 1863, the Liberal Schulze-Delitzsch and the Socialist Lassalle made forcible appeals to the German workingmen, Ketteler studied their doctrines and even consulted Lassalle in an anonymous letter on a scheme of founding five small co-operative associations of workingmen.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>The labour question and Christianity</h2>

<p>In a book published in 1864, "The Labour Question and Christianity," he adopted Lassalle's criticism of the modern treatment of labour, and admitted the reality of an insurmountable law. In opposition to Schulze-Delitzsch he pointed out the futility of the remedies proposed by the <a href="09212a.htm">Liberals</a>; he advocated labour associations, and even accepted the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of co-operative unions to be established, not as Lassalle wished, by state subvention, but by generous aid from <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> capitalists. In a Socialistic meeting at Rondsdorf, 23 May, 1864, Lassalle paid homage to Ketteler's book. On his side, Ketteler, whom three <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workmen had asked in 1866 if they could conscientiously join the "workingmen's association" founded by Lassalle, was disposed to dissuade them from so doing owing to the anti-religious spirit of Lassalle's successors; nevertheless in his reply he duly acknowledged Lassalle's "respectful recognition of the depth and <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>." At this time he counted particularly upon the initiative of <a href="03592a.htm">Christian charity</a> for the organization of productive co-operative associations destined to restore social <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> on a more equal scale. In 1869 he went still further: in a sermon preached near Offenbach, 25 July of that year, he particularized certain urgent reforms (increase of wages, shorter hours of labour, prohibition of child-labour in factories, prohibition of <a href="15687b.htm">women's</a> and young girls' labour); these claims, he thought, should be presented to the public authorities. In Sept., 1869, at the <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> conference of the German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he showed how <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the removal of <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> evils was the intervention of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the name of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, and charity. He also made clear the right of workingmen to legal protection and urged that in every <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> some <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> should be selected to make a study of <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> questions. This <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> discourse of Ketteler brought the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> into closer relations with the new social activity; on the other hand, his programme for protection of labour, taken up again in 1873 in his pamphlet on "Catholics in the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>," long served the German Centre as a basis for their social claims.</p>

<h2>Doctrinal controversies; the Vatican Council</h2>

<p>Though not professionally a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, Ketteler made his influence felt in the various <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> controversies of his time. In his "Liberty, Authority, and Church" (1862) he took a stand on the question of <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> and set forth the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> attitude towards the various meanings of the word <em>liberty</em>. The <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> "school" which Ketteler established in his <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and whose chief representatives were <a href="10603a.htm">Moufang</a> and Heinrich, was noted for its adherence to <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic theology</a> and its hostility to the anti-Roman tendencies of "Germanism" and "German Science" represented by D&ouml;llingerer and the <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> School. The former urged with much tenacity the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, as preferable to the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties of the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and earnestly strove since 1862, for the establishment of that free <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> which is yet a desideratum. Despite this firm attitude, Ketteler had great <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> charity, and could understand <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> views that differed somewhat from his own, and when <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> could be their advocate; it was doubtless to him that <a href="08703a.htm">Kuhn</a> of T&uuml;bingen was indebted for escaping condemnation at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<p>On the eve of the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, Ketteler was not very favourably inclined towards the <a href="04675b.htm">dogmatic definition</a> of <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>: "In our time it is not opportune to increase the number of <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a>," he wrote to <a href="05202a.htm">Bishop Dupanloup</a>. Enemy as he was of political absolutism and centralization, he feared that a declaration of <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> would result in religious absolutism and centralization. He submitted to the episcopal assembly at <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> (1 Sept., 1869) a series of observations which he had asked from Francis Brentano, professor at <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and in which the definition of <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> was treated as inopportune; at the same time he rough-drafted the letter in which this assembly urged all <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> to submit to the future council. Though belonging to the minority in the council, he protested more than once against the "Roman Letters" of D&ouml;llingerer, published at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> under the pseudonym of "Quirinus." He circulated in the council a pamphlet of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Quarella, which in some respects seemed to militate against the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, but he did not personally accept all the theories of this work. It was he who suggested the petition of May, 1870, in which a number of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> demanded that the eleven charters of the "Schema" on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> be taken up before entering on the discussion of <a href="07790a.htm">infallibility</a>. On 23 May he declared in a plenary meeting that he had always believed in <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, but he asked whether the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> put forward sufficed to justify its <a href="04675b.htm">dogmatic definition</a>. He was not present at the final vote and left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> after a written declaration that he submitted beforehand to the decision of the council. In September, 1870, he signed, with other German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> declaration in favour of the newly defined <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>.</p>

<h2>Ketteler and German unity</h2>

<p>The political changes that now took place in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and the indirect effect they might have upon <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, were a source of much anxiety to him. When <a href="02121b.htm">Austria's</a> defeat at Sadowa (1866) filled the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> with consternation, and <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that their dream of an Austrian <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> was quite over, Ketteler tried to revive their <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> in his "Germany after the War of 1866." He advised them to meet halfway the coming changes, and to let no one surpass them in their <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of the German Fatherland. On the other hand, he besought <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> not to be misled by those who would make her an instrument of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> or of certain <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> theories, and urged the respect of all existing political and social autonomies.</p>

<p>After the establishment of German unity (1870-71) Ketteler's chief concern was to obtain for German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the new empire such liberties and guarantees as the Constitution granted them in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. This much he demanded in a letter to Bismarck (1 Oct., 1870), also during a visit he paid him in the spring of 1871, and in a speech in the Reichstag (3 April, 1871), where he served as a deputy from the Baden constituency of Wald&uuml;rn-Tauberbischofsheim. The National Liberal party, on the contrary, urged the new empire towards religious <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Ketteler conferred once more with Bismarck, on 16 March, 1871, again pleaded with him for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and then, on 14 March, 1872, resigned his seat in the German Parliament. He kept in touch, however, with religious polities, and wrote important pamphlets against the <a href="08703b.htm">Prussian Kulturkampf</a>, also against similar measures which the National <a href="09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, yet influential with Dalwigk's successors, were inaugurating in <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>. During the <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> his share in the <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> episcopal conferences was often predominant. He and <a href="10156a.htm">Archbishop Melchers</a> of Cologne were potent in the decision passed in 1873 urging the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to oppose the May Laws by absolute passive resistance, and, on the other hand, advocating a conciliatory attitude towards the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> law on the administration of <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>. In 1873 his views on the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> led him to enter the broader political field in his book on "The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>" in which he drew up a platform for the <a href="16020b.htm">Centre Party</a> and offered wise direction to the State. He contrasted frequently the <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> of 1848, sincerely respectful of religious <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>, with the "National <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>" of Bismarckian <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the old German <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of local autonomy with the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of centralization borrowed from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. He <a href="07149b.htm">hated</a> in Bismarckian <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> the spread of political absolutism quite as in modern industrialism he <a href="07149b.htm">hated</a> the development of capitalist absolutism. The spirit of initiative which characterized this <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is well set forth in a letter written, 6 May, 1870, to Haffner, future <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>: "I am heart and <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> attached to the new forms which in days to come the old <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> will create for all human relations." Of him <a href="15655a.htm">Windthorst</a> said, in 1890: "We venerate him unanimously as the doctor and leading champion of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> social aspirations."</p>
