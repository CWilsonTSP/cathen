<p>Usually known as S<font size=-2>IR</font> A<font size=-2>NTHONY</font> V<font size=-2>AN</font> D<font size=-2>YCK</font>.</p>

<p>Flemish portrait-painter, b. at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 22 March, 1599; d. in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, 9 December, 1641. This great <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> was the seventh child of a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of twelve, being the son of Frans Van Dyck, merchant in silk, linen, and kindred materials, and of Maria, daughter of Dirk Cuypers and Catherina Conincx. While still a boy he was placed, on the advice of Jan Brueghel, as a pupil in the studio of Hendrick Van Balen, who had been a pupil of <a href="13214c.htm">Rubens</a>. The young artist's development as a <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> was rapid, for it is recorded that at the age of fourteen he <a href="11395a.htm">painted</a> a portrait of an old man, and a lawsuit in 1660 revealed the fact that he had also produced when quite a youth a series of heads exceedingly well <a href="11395a.htm">painted</a>. A <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of his skill is the fact that in 1618, before he was twenty, he was admitted to the freedom of the guild of St. Luke in <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, an unusual distinction for a youthful <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a>. The tradition that Van Dyck was apprenticed to <a href="13214c.htm">Rubens</a> or was ever his pupil must be dismissed. Investigations have <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that he was regarded as a master in his art when he was introduced to the studio of <a href="13214c.htm">Rubens</a>. Here Van Dyck made one of the group of young men who assisted the master in his decorative works, which it would have been quite impossible for him to complete by himself.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1620, at the request of the Countess of Arundel, Van Dyck appears to have come to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and to have received commissions from James I for which he was paid in February, 1621. After executing these orders he returned to Antwerp and then determined to visit <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, leaving in October, 1621, and remaining abroad for five years. He spent some time at <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, moved on to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and then visited Florence; from here he went to Bologna, and later by way of <a href="09611b.htm">Mantua</a> to <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>. After this he was at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and finally in 1623 in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The records of this journey remain in the famous "Chatsworth Sketch Book". His life in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was unsatisfactory, for he made many enemies, and soon left the <a href="13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> and settled in <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, where he was exceedingly popular. His portraits of the great nobility of <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a> rank among the finest in the world and form a magnificent and unrivalled series. In 1624 he visited Palermo, <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a> the portrait of Emmanuel of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, Viceroy of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and some church pictures, but returned to <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and in 1626 left for Antwerp, probably on account of some complications with regard to the division of his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> estate. He visited Aachen and is believed to have gone on to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, while tradition states that he made a second visit to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. However, nothing definite is known of his movements until 1630 when he was at <a href="07108a.htm">The Hague</a>, and shortly afterwards back in his native town. Another tradition, which speaks of the rivalry between <a href="13214c.htm">Rubens</a> and Van Dyck, has to be discredited. Mr. Lionel Cust and others have shown that the two <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a> were not only on terms of equality with regard to their art, but that a generous and cordial friendship existed between them.</p>

<p>In 1632 Van Dyck went again to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and was graciously received by Charles I. He appears to have passed into the king's service immediately, as a warrant was issued on 21 May, 1632, for the payment of an allowance to him, and a residence given him in Blackfriars. He had also a summer residence in the palace of Eltham, was knighted on 5 July, presented with a chain and medal of great value, and granted a pension of &#163;200 a year to be paid quarterly. From the moment of his arrival commenced his great success as a portrait <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The king and queen sat to him frequently, and he was overwhelmed with commissions. In 1634-5 he received a pressing invitation to visit the court at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and accepted it, but in 1635 he was back at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> and in the same year returned to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, taking again his position as portrait-painter to Charles I and to Henrietta Maria. Of the king he <a href="11395a.htm">painted</a> no less than thirty-six portraits and about twenty-five of Queen Henrietta Maria, but perhaps the most beautiful works executed for the royal family were those in which he depicted the children of the royal pair. To this period belong the wonderful portraits of members of the English aristocracy to be found in so many of the great English houses. He prepared a scheme for decorating the walls of the banqueting-house at Whitehall, the sketches for which still exist, but the royal exchequer could not afford the work. In 1640 he decided to return to Antwerp. <a href="13214c.htm">Rubens</a> had died and Van Dyck was acknowledged the head of the <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a> School and entertained with great magnificence. He was disposed to settle permanently at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, but first went to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, desiring to obtain the commission to decorate the gallery of the Louvre. The work was, however, given to French artists and Van Dyck returned to <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> for a while, later on in the year, however, visiting Antwerp and <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and then coming back to London. When he arrived his health was in a critical condition, and despite the attention of the royal physician he died at his house in Blackfriars eight days after his wife had given birth to a daughter. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. Paul's Cathedral, and a monument was erected to his memory by order of the king, but the grave and monument perished with the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in the great fire of 1666.</p>

<p>In portraiture Van Dyck is the greatest artist of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> after <a href="14742a.htm">Titian</a>, and in works of decorative splendour perhaps only rivalled by <a href="13214c.htm">Rubens</a>. He was a man of luxurious and somewhat indolent habits, ambitious, proud, sensitive, and quick to take offence. In his portraits the elegance of the composition, the delicate expression of the heads, the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and purity of his colouring, and the strong lifelike quality of expression give him the very highest position, and he is one of the few <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a> whom all critics have placed in the front rank. In a consideration of his art the brilliant and vigorous etchings must not be overlooked.</p>
