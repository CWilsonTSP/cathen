<p>Consent is the deliberate agreement required of those concerned in legal transactions in order to legalize such actions. Words, deeds, writing, or silence hear witness to the existence of this consent. Completeness of consent is gauged not so much by the preliminaries of transactions as by their ratification, which is the <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> development of incipient consent, and gives consistency to legal transactions. The consent <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to constitute contracts must be internal, external, mutual, and deliberate. Some authorities claim that contracts formed without any intention on the part of the contracting parties to <a href="11189a.htm">oblige</a> themselves are valid; others more rightly maintain the contrary, since the very essence of contracts embodies <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>. Consequently, whoever is unprepared to admit this <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> is in no position to make a contract. Two possible suppositions here present themselves. In the first the promise and intention of not assuming any <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> concern the same object under the same respect. Promises made in this way are utterly meaningless. In the second supposition the promise and intention of waiving the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> refer to the same object under different respects. In such cases it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to ascertain which of these two contrary tendencies of the will is dominant. If the intention of making a contract possess greater efficacy, the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> thereunto corresponding unquestionably holds good. On the contrary, if the intention of accepting no <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> prevail, no contract can be formed. Finally, if one intention is just as efficacious as another, the formation of a contract would then involve quest for an unattainable result. Contracts made by <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> having absolutely no intention of abiding by the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> connected therewith are altogether invalid, and the parties thus fictitiously contracting are bound to indemnify those whose interests thereby suffer. The contract in question must always be capable of begetting an <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>. It is not impossible to find genuine consent which is worthless for giving consistency to contracts either because it is nullified beforehand by positive law or because it is the result of <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a>, or fear (see <a href="04332a.htm">CONTRACT</a>).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Error affecting the very nature of the contract, or concerning the substance of the object in question or a naturally substantial quality of the object, or one considered indispensable by the contracting parties, vitiates consent and invalidates contracts. Error regarding an accidental quality of the contract, or pertaining to the motive underlying the contract, or to its material object, is insufficient to vitiate consent or nullify contracts. In like manner <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a>, whether introduced by one of the contracting parties or by an extern, for the sake of provoking consent in the other party, counteracts consent as often as such <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a> circumscribes the nature of the contract, the substance of the object at stake, or a quality naturally substantiated in that object or esteemed as substantial by the one upon whom the <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a> is perpetrated. As often as accidental <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a> induces another, in some measure, to consent, he is at liberty to rescind the contract, provided it is naturally dissoluble. In general, grave fear lawfully superinduced does not militate against consent in the will, and therefore renders contracts neither invalid nor rescindable. On the other hand, while fear unlawfully superinduced to extort consent does not invalidate contracts, it gives the intimidated party the liberty of rescinding them. According to the <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, no contract is binding without the mutual assent of both parties. They must assent at the same time and to the same thing. This mutual assent consists of an offer by one party and its acceptance by another. When the offer is verbal, and the time allowed for acceptance is not mentioned, the offer must be immediately accepted to constitute a contract. In case the offer and acceptance are written and pass through the mail, the contract is complete when the acceptance is mailed, provided the party accepting has received no notice of the withdrawal of the offer before mailing his letter. As far as the validity of matrimony is concerned, genuine, internal, personal consent of both parties, covering the present and indicated by external signs, is unquestionably required. While internal consent must be complemented by some external manifestation, words are by no means <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The Congregation of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> (22 August, 1860) decided that marriages are entirely valid when the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> takes place in the presence of witnesses and according to the custom of the country in a manner which indicates that the contracting parties here and now mutually agree to enter wedlock. At the same time, if one or both contracting parties have no present intention of marrying in circumstances such as those outlined, they can make no marriage contract. The required matrimonial consent signified by proxy does not militate against the validity of the marriage contract. This consent must include the material object of the matrimonial contract, which material object is the mutual right of one party to the body of the other, a right that carries with it every prerogative vested therein by the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature. It is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, however, that the intention of parties to a marriage contract should be explicitly directed to all its conditions or circumstances. On the contrary, an intention implicitly thereunto directed is entirely sufficient for all practical intents and purposes. Hence, as often as marriageable parties intend to contract marriage in the way in which men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> ordinarily understand that agreement, or according to the way in which it was instituted by the Author of this sacrament, they exhibit consent sufficient to render their marriage contract entirely valid, provided nothing essential is positively excluded by a counter intention usurping the place of the chief, indispensable intention in entering matrimony. While marriage contracts are null unless based on the consent of those concerned, it is usually very difficult to establish the actual absence of this consent so as to satisfy the judge in a matrimonial court, once the marriage <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> has really taken place. (For the renewal of consent in the case of invalid <a href="09707a.htm">marriages</a>, see REVALIDATION, and for the consent requisite for espousals, see <a href="05542d.htm">ESPOUSALS</a>.) While in canon law the consent of <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to validate the marriages of their children, it is usually required to render such marriages legitimate. [For the <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> concerning the consent of <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (modified 1907), <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, etc., see MARRIAGE.]</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> exacts no solemnity to validate matrimonial consent. In many of the States, however, special <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> carrying a penalty require certain conditions for the legitimacy of such consent. <a href="09068a.htm">Common law</a> regards marriage as a civil contract for which consent alone is essential. It demands no legal forms, nor religious solemnities, nor special mode of <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a>. According to <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a>, consent indicated by words covering the present, whether consummation follows or not, or by words pertaining to the future together with consummation, constitutes a valid marriage. In New York, <a href="07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and Rhode Island words pertaining to the future, even with subsequent consummation, no longer render a marriage valid. Even without explicit <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of words implying consent, cohabitation, acknowledgment of a marriage by the parties concerned, reception of such parties as husband and wife by relatives, friends, or <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, are sufficient to establish a valid marriage.</p>

<p>Canon law requires the consent of <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters to lend validity to certain official acts of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In general, this consent is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in such matters as usually involve a serious <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> or the possibility of a notable damage, or in matters which simultaneously pertain to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and their chapters. Nevertheless, unwritten law can narrow the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of chapters and widen the liberty of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in these matters unless circumstances conspire to stamp particular measures as unreasonable. In like manner, unwritten law may exact the consent of chapters in matters of secondary importance, a requirement sometimes enjoined by special <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>. When immediate action is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and it is impossible to convoke their chapters, <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> may proceed validly without the chapters' consent. Inasmuch as there are no <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors constitute the advisory board of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The Third <a href="02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> specifies several instances in which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, though not <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to abide by the advice of their consultors, are bound to seek such advice, else their acts in such cases are liable to nullification.</p>
