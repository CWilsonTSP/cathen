<p>Formerly an electoral principality (the Mark of Brandenburg), and a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the heart of the present <a href="12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a>, now a Province of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order an Apostolic Delegature.</p>

<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>The lands extending eastward from the Elbe to the Vistula, once inhabited by Germans, were invaded by <a href="14042a.htm">Slavic</a> tribes who, during the sixth century of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> era, pushed their way as far as the Elbe and the Saale in <a href="14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>. <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> was the first to check their advance; later, Henry I attacked them, captured Brennabor, the stronghold of the Lusatians, and to safeguard his conquests established the North Mark. In 939 <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a> brought the country of the Hevelli under his power, placed the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavic</a> races as far as the Oder under tribute, and to further the work of their conversion founded the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Havelberg and Brandenburg (948), which in 968 were placed under the recently founded <a href="09524b.htm">Archdiocese of Magdeburg</a>. Nevertheless, <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> made slow progress. The hate of the subdued for their German conquerors, far from abating, burst forth in a great uprising (983). The <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a> pressed on as far as the Elbe, conquered Brandenburg and Havelberg, and destroyed the seeds of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization that had been planted there. Emperors Henry II and Conrad II, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, again brought the Lusatians under the power of the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, but the real evangelization of the country was not resumed until the time of Count Albert of Ballenstadt, founder of the Ascanian line, who had been made Margrave of the North Mark by Emperor Lothair II (1134). Albert entered into friendly relations with the Wendish prince, Pribislav, at that time the ruler of Brandenburg, was chosen by him as his heir, and in 1150 took possession of the land, assuming at the same time the title of Margrave of Brandenburg. He brought colonists from the Lower Rhine and Utrecht, who by the methods learned in their old homes reclaimed the swamp lands of the Mark for agricultural purposes; the cities were peopled anew; the Dioceses of Brandenburg and Havelberg re-established; churches and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> erected; and the Wendish population soon won over to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The most active part in the conversion of the country was taken by the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> and <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. Even before the death of their founder, <a href="11100b.htm">St. Norbert</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> (1126-34), the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> founded the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Gottesgnaden (1131) and later that of Leitzkau, near Magdeburg (1149), as well as <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Jerichow (1144), the city of Brandenburg (1165), Gramzow in the Uckermark (c. 1180), and elsewhere. The <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of Brandenburg and Havelberg and the seats in their respective <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters were held by members of this order. The <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> were equalled in <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, particularly during the thirteenth century, by the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, who had been introduced into the country by Albert's son and successor. Their foundations at Zinna (1170), Lehnin (1183), Chorin (1272), J&uuml;terbog (1282), Himmelpforte (c. 1290), etc., were centres for the work of colonization, which was conducted on a large scale.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>When the Ascanian line had become extinct, Emperor Louis the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> annexed the Mark to his own territories (1320), but as early as 1373 the House of Wittelsbach was forced to relinquish Brandenburg, which in 1356 had been raised to the rank of an electorate, to Emperor Charles IV, who made it a dependency of the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Crown. Charles restored discipline, put an end to the extortion of the nobles, established the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of Tangermunde, and raised the Mark to renewed prosperity. The Dioceses of Brandenburg and Havelberg, however, ceased to be direct fiefs of the empire. Charles's son, Sigismund, mortgaged the Mark (1388-1411) and in 1411 appointed as <em>Statthalter</em> (Governor) Burgrave Frederick of <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, who took possession in 1412, and, having overcome the opposition of the nobles, was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> invested with the Mark of Brandenburg as an elector of the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a> (1417). In this way Brandenburg passed into the possession of the Hohenzollerns, who have since held it without interruption. While Frederick I occupied himself almost exclusively with matters connected with the empire, his son, <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (1440-70), concentrated his attention on the government of his territory. Distinguished form his youth for great <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, he promoted the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> of his subjects, worked for the reform of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, made the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters of Brandenburg and Havelberg centres of religious and secular culture, founded the <a href="14346c.htm">Order of the Swan</a> for nobles, and received from <a href="11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a> (1447) the right of appointment for the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the Mark. His grandson John, surnamed Cicero (1486-99), took the initiative in the establishment of the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> on the Oder, opened in 1506, and destined to be for a time a stronghold of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the religious <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> stirred up by <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>.</p>

<p>Dissensions between <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and people had cooperated with other unfortunate circumstances in the Mark of Brandenburg, to create conditions amid which the new teachings took rapid root. Elector Joachim I (1499-1535), whose younger brother, Albert, was made <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Halberstadt in 1513, and in 1514 <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Elector of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and Archchancellor of the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, was extremely hostile towards the religious innovations, and endeavoured to have the edict formally condemning <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> passed by the Reichstag, at Worms. He forbade the circulation of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> translation of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> and the preaching of the new doctrines within his territory, and he prohibited his subjects from attending the <a href="15678b.htm">University of Wittenberg</a>.</p>

<p>Through the efforts of wandering preachers, nevertheless, <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> teachings soon gained a large following, not only in various parts of the Mark, but in the very <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the elector, counting among its adherents his cousin Albert, Grand Master of the German Order, his son-in-law, John of Anhalt, and even his wife, Elizabeth. Before his death, Joachim made his two sons, coheirs of his lands, solemnly promise fidelity to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In spite of this, the younger, John of Kustrin, as early as 1538, became a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and was followed by his subjects. The elder, Elector Joachim II (1535-70), influenced by his wife, daughter of the Polish king, Sigismund, at first held fast to the old Faith, though allowing <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergymen</a> to minister to several <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in his territory; finally, at Spandau in 1539, he received the sacrament under both forms at the hands of Matthias von Jagow, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Brandenburg, likewise a partisan of the new doctrines. His defection was imitated by the majority of the cities in the Mark, Berlin at their head, and by the nobles almost as a body. The Bishops of Havelberg and Lebus alone offered steady resistance. In 1540 the electoral prince, by virtue of this authority as national <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, issued a new church ordinance which was based on <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification, though preserving many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions, such as the episcopal system of organization, and many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ceremonies and customs, even to the Latin Mass, feasts of the Blessed Virgin, processions, etc., that the common people might not realize how the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> was being gradually withdrawn from them. Between 1540 and 1542 an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> visitation of the whole Mark was undertaken; the <a href="13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> who had withstood the innovations of the elector were mercilessly expelled; the foundation of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men were suppressed; <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> were converted into asylums for noble maidens; much <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a> and many endowment funds were confiscated and mortgaged to nobles or cities; and church plate and valuables were melted down. In 15443, the Consistory was constituted the highest spiritual authority. The elector took advantage of the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> obtained through the Religious Peace of Augsburg (1555) to complete the work of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in his principality. After the death of the last of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who held fast to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>--those of Lebus (1555) and Havelberg (1561)--he succeeded in having his eldest grandson, later Prince Elector Joachim Frederick, appointed <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, thus preparing for the future secularization of the <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. The administration of the Diocese of Brandenburg he confided to his son, John George. This gave the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> a complete victory; whatever savoured of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> was gradually eliminated, and by the beginning of the seventeenth century, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services were absolutely prohibited. Not until the establishment of the <a href="12519c.htm">Kingdom of Prussia</a> were <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> again allowed to hold public worship. (For the later history of the Mark of Brandenburg, see <a href="12519c.htm">PRUSSIA</a>.)</p>

<h3>The Diocese of Brandenburg</h3>

<p>The Diocese of Brandenburg, founded 1 October, 948, by Otto the Great, was bounded on the east by the Oder, on the west and south by the Elbe and the Black Elster, and on the north by the Uckermark. The first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="05047d.htm">Thietmar or Ditmar</a> (d. before 968); his successor, Dodilo, was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> in 980. The succeeding <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, after the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> Wends again conquered Brandenburg (983), lived for the most part as coadjutors to other <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> in various places in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Bishop Wigger, the fifteenth in line of succession (1138-60), was the first who was able to return to his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Like his successors, as late as the middle of the fifteenth century, Bishop Wigger belonged to the Order of <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, and formed his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter form members of his order. Among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the fifteenth century, Stephen Bodeker (1421-59) distinguished himself by unusual activity along the lines of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and reform. Matthias von Jagow (1527-44), the forty-fourth <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was one of the most <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoters of the so-called <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; although in 1528 he bound himself by <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and to Elector Joachim I to withstand the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> innovations, he installed a <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> preacher in the city of Brandenburg in the same year, released his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from their <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> (1535), and introduced the administration of Communion under both forms. After the resignation of his successor, Joachim, Duke of M&uuml;nsterberg Prince Elector John George was appointed administrator of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which by that very act was secularized.
