<p>(<a href="08245a.htm">Italian</a> <em>Piemonte</em>).</p>

<p>A part <em>compartimento</em> of northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, bounded on the north by <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, on the west by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, on the south by Liguria, and on the east by <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. It includes the plain of the Upper Po, and the Alpine valleys that descend towards the plain from the south side of the Pennine Alps, from the east side of the Graiian and Cottian, and from the north side of the Maritime Alps. Its name, <em>pedes montium,</em> from which arose <em>Pedimontium,</em> came from its geographical position, enclosed on three sides by high mountains. At the present time it includes the four Italian provinces of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="11134b.htm">Novara</a>, <a href="01283d.htm">Alessandria</a>, and <a href="04569b.htm">Cuneo</a>. In the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and in antiquity the country was important chiefly because it contained the passes over the Alps which led from <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> to Gaul. Until the beginning of the fourth century <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had made little progress. However, in the course of the fourth and fifth centuries <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> spread rapidly among the people, now completely Romanized. The earliest <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> were established in this era, namely <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a>, and <a href="01591c.htm">Aosta</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the early <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> various petty <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> states were formed in the Piedmontese country, the most important of which were the Marquessates of <a href="08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>, Suso, <a href="13405c.htm">Saluzzo</a>, Montferrat, and the Countship of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>. The counts of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> early made successful attempts to establish their authority in this region. At the beginning of the eleventh century Aosta and the territory under its control belonged to Count Humbert I of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. His son Oddo (Otto, d. 1060) married the Marchioness Adelaide of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>, and in this way became possessed of the Marquessate of <a href="14345a.htm">Susa</a>, with the towns of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> and Pinerolo, the foundation of the later Piedmont. After the death (1232) of Thomas I, Count of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, this marquessate went to a younger branch, the descendants of Thomas II (d. 1259), son of Thomas I; Amadeus V, son of Thomas II, is the ancestor of the present Italian royal family. These rulers called themselves Counts of Piedmont. On account of the position of their territories the Dukes of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> had a large share in the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> for supremacy in northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Besides extending their authority into <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, they also gained new domains in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>: the lordships of <a href="15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, <a href="02018b.htm">Asti</a>, and Cava, and the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> suzerainty over Montferrat. In the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> between the <a href="03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> and <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I of France</a>, Duke Charles III (d. 1553) of Piedmont lost the greater part of his duchy. In the Peace of C&#226;teau-Cambresis (1559), however, his son Emmanuel Philibert (d. 1580) regained nearly all of his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> possessions, and obtained, in exchange for other territories, the Marquessate of Tenda and the Principality of Oneglia.</p>

<p>Emmanuel Philibert's successor, Charles Emmanuel I (1580-1630), acquired the Marquessate of <a href="13405c.htm">Saluzzo</a> and a large part of Montferrat, which his son Victor Amadeus I (1630-37) was able to retain by conceding two other lordships to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. During the regency of the <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of Victor Amadeus I, the French Princess Christine, the influence of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in the Duchy of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> was greatly increased. Her son Charles Emmanuel II (d. 1675) sought in vain to escape this dominating control. Victor Amadeus II (1675-1730) joined the great alliance against <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in the War of the Spanish Succession. By the victory of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> in 1706 Prince Eugene drove out the French troops that had made a sudden descent upon Piedmont, thus ridding the duke of his enemies. As a reward for joining the alliance the duke received by the Peace of <a href="15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> of 1713 the Marquessate of Montferrat, the <a href="01283d.htm">City of Alessandria</a>, and the Districts of Val Sesia and Lomellina, so that the part of his territories situated in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> had essentially the same extent as the present Department of Piedmont. Outside of these new territories he was granted the Island of Sicily, which, however, he lost again when Spanish troops attacked the island in 1718. In 1720 as compensation for this loss he received the island of <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. He now assumed the title of King of <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>; besides the island, the kingdom included <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and Piedmont on the mainland. In the Polish and Austrian <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of succession the next king, Charles Emmanuel III (as king, Charles Emmanuel I, 1730-73), acquired the additional Italian districts of <a href="14784c.htm">Tortona</a> and <a href="11134b.htm">Novara</a>, also Anghiera, <a href="02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, and a part of the principality of Pavia. His son Victor Amadeus III (1773-96) was a weak man of little importance. During his reign the storms caused by the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> swept over his kingdom. <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> victories <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> him in 1796 to cede <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and Nice to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and his son and successor Charles Emmanuel II (1796-1802) lost all his territories on the mainland, which, together with Liguria and <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a>, were united to Fance. The king abdicated, entered the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and in 1802 resigned the crown to his brother Victor Emmanuel I. At first the latter resided in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Until the seventeenth century the position of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in Piedmont was a satisfactory one; no restriction was placed upon its activities. The country contained numerous <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; of these Aosta was a suffragan of <a href="14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>, Nice of Embrun, and the other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> on Italian soil were suffragans of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>. In 1515 <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>, where the Dukes of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> lived, was made an archdiocese with the two suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="08258a.htm">Ivrea</a> and <a href="10478a.htm">Mondov&igrave;</a>. As lord chancellor and first secretary of state the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> was by law a member of the council of state. The ducal <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> was very religious, and until the end of the seventeenth century maintained close relations with the Papal See, which had established a permanent nunciature at <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> in the sixteenth century, while an agent of the Government of Piedmont resided at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For some of their domains the dukes were vassals of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but this relation caused no difficulties. There was a large body of <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were numerous. There were also two <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>, that of St. Lazarus, an order of hospitallers for the care of the sick, especially <a href="09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and that of St. Mauritius, which had been founded by Amadeus VIII in 1434 and confirmed in 1572 by <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>. The same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the union of the two orders, of which the duke was the perpetual grand master. The original purpose of these knightly orders was, however, very soon lost sight of; in recent times they have been changed into a secular decoration. Duke Charles Emmanuel I was very <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the struggle against <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and both he and his two successors took energetic measures against the growth of the <a href="15527b.htm">Waldensians</a>. However, Emmanuel Philibert made the execution of the judgments of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> dependent on the consent of the senate and judicial investigation by the Government.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century the dukes, who had become absolute rulers, and their administrative officials began to suppress the liberties of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in imitation of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. They even interfered in the purely <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus during the administration of Victor Amadeus, who was the actual ruler from 1684, violent dissensions with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> arose and seriously injured <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>, especially because large numbers of <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and higher <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> remained <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> for a long period. Lengthy negotiations were carried on with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. An edict issued by Victor Amadeus in 1694 for the benefit of the <a href="15527b.htm">Waldensians</a> was rejected at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, because it annulled the old law for the protection of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The duke took the most severe measures against this Roman <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>. The senate forbade its publication under heavy penalties, so that it could not be executed, and the tribunal of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> of Piedmont lost nearly all its importance. The Dioceses of <a href="03396a.htm">Casale</a>, <a href="01110a.htm">Acqui</a>, and <a href="15343a.htm">Ventimiglia</a> included parts of the territory of Piedmont, although the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> did not reside in the duchy; this was regarded as a great grievance. The duke wished to force these <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to appoint episcopal vicars for the supervision of those of his subjects belonging to their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; this the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> refused to do. Whereupon the landed <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> in Piedmont belonging to the <a href="11048a.htm">Diocese of Nice</a> was sequestrated; this led the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, after three years of unsuccessful negotiations, to <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> the secular officials who had carried out the ducal <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>. The senate forbade the recognition of the sentence of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> under the severest penalties, for the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> the penalty of death, and commanded the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to grant the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. This last command, however, was recalled by the duke as too extreme a measure against <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority.</p>

<p>Victor Amadeus now claimed the entire <a href="12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> to all the sees and to all the <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in his territories granted by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in consistory, on ground of a privilege conferred by <a href="11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a> in 1451 upon Duke Louis of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, whereby the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, before filling sees and abbacies, would ask for the opinion and consent of the duke in regard to the <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> nominated. This privilege had been confirmed on various occasions during the sixteenth century. <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was not willing to acknowledge the privilege in this enlarged form. The duke had also issued an edict by which a secular judge was not to grant permission to those desiring to enter the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> until he had fully informed himself concerning the ability of the candidate, the number of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the locality, and of the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> there, and the nature of the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> to be assigned to the candidate for his support. In 1700 a bitter dispute arose between the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> and the ducal delegation, when the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> declared invalid the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> arrangements proposed by the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> against the decrees of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. However, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, supported by the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, followed the instructions of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions. Further disputes also arose concerning the testamentary competency of regulars, a right which was denied the <a href="12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> by the Government, and as to the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the fiefs of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> that were possessed by the dukes. These questions were exhaustively examined at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the advocate of the consistory, Sardini, was sent to <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> to negotiate the matters; but the agreement adjusting the difficulty that was obtained by him was not accepted at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. New troubles constantly arose when the duke confiscated the revenues of <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> accruing during their vacancy and abrogated the <em>spolia</em> (property of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> deceased intestate) of <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. The Government appointed an administrator of its own for the care and administration of the estates of vacant <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, but he was not recognized by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Secular approval of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> acts and ordinances was made <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in a continually increasing number of cases. New negotiations, undertaken in 1710 at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Count de Gubernatis, produced no results. The only agreement reached was in regard to the administrator of vacant <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, who was also appointed the Apostolic administrator for this purpose. In this form the office of the Apostolic-royal steward continued to exist.</p>

<p>When the Island of Sardinia was granted to Piedmont in 1720 a new conflict arose, as the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> claimed to be the sovereign of the island. The basis of this was that <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> had invested the King of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> with the island under the condition that it should never be separated from the crown of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. Consequently the demand was made upon the new King of <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> that he should seek <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> investiture. As Victor Amadeus refused to do this, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> rejected the arrangements for filling the <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> and <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> made by the king, who also claimed all the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of patronage exercised by the Spanish sovereign. As a consequence most of the sees on the islands were without incumbents, which increased the difficulties. <a href="02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1724-30) sought to bring about a reconciliation in order to put an end to the injury inflicted on <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>. In <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> the necessity of an accommodation was also realized, and the king sent the adroit and skillful Marquese d'Ormea to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to prepare the way for the negotiations. The peace-loving <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> made large concessions, although the king made still further encroachments upon the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The negotiations were carried on by a congegation composed of four <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and the <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> Merlini. Several points were adjusted, especially the king's <a href="12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> to the <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and abbacies, while others were discussed, particularly the immunity of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the right of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to claim the <em>spolia,</em> also the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to charge <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenues with pensions. Most of the difficulties were finally adjusted, and an agreement was signed in 1727, so that the vacant sees could now be filled and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration resumed. King Charles Emmanuel III (1730-73) made new conventions with <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1740-59), who had formerly supported the Marquess d'Ormea in his negotiations, and had always maintained friendly relations with him. By two conventions made in 1741 the King of <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> was granted the Apostolic vicariate for the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> fiefs on condition of paying a quit-rent, and the questions of the <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, the revenues of <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> during vacancy, and the administration of these vacant <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> were adjusted. Notwithstanding his friendliness, the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> commissioner had a very difficult position to maintain in his relations with the president of the senate, Caissotti. Finally on 6 Jan., 1742, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> issued instructions to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in which both sides had concurred; in these it was made the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of foreign <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to appoint vicars for the parts of their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the territory of Piedmont, <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> was curtailed, and the landed <a href="12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> that had been obtained after 1620 was made subject to the ordinary civil taxes. In 1750 the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> resigned various revenues that the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> derived from Piedmont in return for a very small indemnity. Charles Emmanuel III now remained on the best of terms with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> notwithstanding isolated difficulties and disputes which still arose. Merlini was once more received at <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> as <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, and the piously- inclined king sought to promote the interests of religion, to protect <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> discipline, and to support the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in other countries.</p>

<p>The last period of the history of the <a href="13473b.htm">Kingdom of Sardinia</a> began after the <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> era. In 1814- 15 Victor Emmanuel I regained Piedmont with the territories of <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a> (Liguria) and <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>. The Government again sought to base the administration on the old political principles of the period before the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, while a large part of the citizens of the country were filled with <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of political independence and <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, and the revolutionary <a href="14071b.htm">secret society</a>, the <a href="03330c.htm">Carbonari</a>, was at work. When in 1821 a military insurrection broke out, the king abdicated in favour of his brother Charles Felix (1821-31). Before Charles Felix arrived the country was administered by Charles Albert, the heir- presumptive to the throne, who was a member of the Savoy-Carignan branch of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. Charles at once established the Spanish constitution of 1812 and summoned a Liberal ministry. However, Charles Felix crushed the Liberal opposition with the aid of <a href="02121b.htm">Austrian</a> troops and reestablished former administrative conditions. At his death the direct line of the dynasty of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> was extinct, and he was succeeded by Charles Albert of Savoy- Carignan (1821-49). The king gave the country a constitution in 1848, summoned a Liberal ministry, and assumed the leadership of the movement for the national unity of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. This led to a <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> in which he was defeated at <a href="11134b.htm">Novara</a>, and consequently was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to abdicate on 4 Nov., 1849, in favour of his son Victor Emmanuel II (1849-78). Count Camillo de Cavour (d. 6 June, 1861) was soon made the head of the administration. Journeys in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> had imbued Cavour with <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of political and parliamentary freedom; from 1848 he had sought to spread his opinions by publishing with the aid of Balbo, Santa Rosa, and others the journal "Il Risorgimento". On 4 Nov., 1852, he was made president of the ministry; he now sought by the <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> development of the country and by diplomatic relations, especially on the occasion of the Crimean War, and at the Congress of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1856, where the "Italian" question was raised, to prepare for <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>.</p>

<p>In a second agreement with <a href="10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> made at Plombi&#232;res on 20 July, 1858, he gained the support of the French emperor by promising to cede <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and Nice to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. In this way Victor Emmanuel II was able in 1859 to begin <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> with the aid of <a href="10699a.htm">Napoleon</a>, and the two allies defeated the <a href="02121b.htm">Austrian</a> army at Magenta (4 June) and at Solferino (24 June). At the same time a revolution broke out in central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> that had been planned by the followers of Mazzini, and the national union founded by him in Piedmont. <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, the duchies, and the districts ruled by delegation received Piedmontese administrators. In his choice of means the only principle followed by Cavour was to use whatever might prove advantageous to him. His connexion with men like Mazzini, Garibaldi, and others shows the lack of principle in his conduct. Piedmont adopted the cause of the revolution. In the Peace of <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, 10 Nov., 1859, it was stipulated that <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> would be given to Piedmont. In 1860 the people of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and Nice voted for union with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, so that these territories now became a part of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and the royal dynasty of Piedmont resigned its native land of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. As compensation for this loss Piedmont received <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and Emilia. On 2 April, 1860, the "National Parliament" was opened at <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>; the parliament, asserting the principle of nationality, demanded "Italy for the <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a>". Soon other Italian domains were absorbed, and on 17 March, 1861, Victor Emmanuel II assumed the title of King of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> (see I<font size=-2>TALY</font>), whereby Piedmont and the <a href="08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a> were merged into the united <a href="08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. On 29 March, 1861, Cavour announced that <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was the future capital of united <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>

<p>After the readjustment of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions in 1817 there were seven Church provinces in the <a href="13473b.htm">Kingdom of Sardinia</a> that had been formed and enlarged in the period following the <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> era. These <a href="01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> were: in Piedmont, <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> with 10 suffragans, to which in 1860 an eleventh, Aosta (which had belonged to Chamb&eacute;ry), was added; <a href="15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> with 5 suffragans; in Luguria, <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a> with 6 suffragans; in <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, Chamb&eacute;ry with 4 suffragans (after the withdrawal of <a href="01591c.htm">Aosta</a> only 3); on the Island of Sardinia the three <a href="01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="03139c.htm">Cagliari</a>, <a href="11316b.htm">Oristano</a>, and <a href="13485a.htm">Sassari</a>, with 8 suffragans. Both the Liberal movement and the intrigues of the revolutionary party in Piedmont were in every way inimical to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In March, 1848, the expulsion of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> was begun in the harshest manner. In October a law regarding instruction was issued that was adverse to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the next year began the hostilities directed against Archbishop Luigi Franconi of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> and other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> and <a href="13485a.htm">Sassari</a> were even <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. In 1850 the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="07690a.htm">immunities</a> were suppressed and <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> was limited. In 1851 the Government regulated <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> instruction without the concurrence of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; in 1852 <a href="09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> was introduced; in 1853 the office of the Apostolic royal-steward was completely secularized; in 1854 <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> were issued directed against the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; in 1855 the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> academy of Superga was suppressed; in 1856 and the following years oppressive measures were issued against <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> administration, such as confiscation of the greater part of the lands of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Using the party cry of a "free <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in a free state", Cavour and his confederates robbed the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in many directions of its essential <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and freedom, as well as of its rightful possessions. The same spirit of hostility to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was shown towards the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>; the nunciature at <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> was suppressed. Thus the union of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was carried on, even by Piedmont, that had allied itself to revolutionary elements hostile to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, in a manner inimical throughout to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and religion. This hostility continued to control the official measures as well as the entire course of the Italian Government.</p>
