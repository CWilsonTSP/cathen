<p>(Giacomo Savelli)</p>

<p>Born at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> about 1210; died at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 April, 1287. He belonged to the rich and influential <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the Savelli and was a grandnephew of <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>. Very little is known of his life before he ascended the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. He studied at the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, during which time he held a <a href="12371a.htm">prebend</a> and a <a href="03252a.htm">canonry</a> at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne</a>. Later he obtained the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> of <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> at the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of Berton, in the <a href="11121a.htm">Diocese of Norwich</a>. In 1261 he was created <a href="03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Cosmedin by <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>, who also appointed him <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> prefect in <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and captain of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> army. By order of <a href="04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> he and three other <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> invested Charles of Anjou as King of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 28 July, 1265. He was one of the six <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who elected <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> by compromise at <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> on 1 Sept., 1271. In 1274 he accompanied <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> to the Fourteenth General Council at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and in July, 1276, he was one of the three <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> whom <a href="01159a.htm">Adrian V</a> sent to <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> with instructions to treat with King Rudolf I of Hapsburg concerning his imperial <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and his future relations towards Charles of Anjou, King of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The death of <a href="01159a.htm">Adrian V</a> in the following month rendered fruitless the negotiations with Rudolf. Nothing further is known of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> doings until, nine years later, he was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> died 28 March, 1285, at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and three days after his death fifteen out of the eighteen <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who then composed the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> had a preliminary consultation at the episcopal residence at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and appointed the following day, 2 April, 1285, for the election of the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The election took place without the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>, which had been prescribed by <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, but suspended by <a href="08429c.htm">John XXI</a>. At the first vote taken, Giacomo Savelli was unanimously elected and took the name of Honorius IV. His election was one of the speediest in the history of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The reason for this great haste may be found in the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> complications, which did not allow any interregnum, and especially in the fact that the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> wished to avoid the unjustifiable interference which occurred at the election of the preceding <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, when Charles of Anjou induced the inhabitants of <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> to imprison two cousins of the deceased <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, in order to effect the election of a pope of French nationality. On 19 May, 1285, the new pontiff was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> by Cardinal Malabranca Orsini of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, and the following day he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the <a href="13369b.htm">basilica of St. Peter</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Honorius IV was already advanced in age and so severely affected with the gout that he could neither stand nor walk. When saying <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to sit on a stool and at the <a href="05380b.htm">Elevation</a> his hands had to be raised by a mechanical contrivance.</p>

<p>Sicilian affairs required the immediate attention of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. By throwing off the rule of Charles of Anjou and taking Pedro III of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> as their king without the consent and approval of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> had practically denied his suzerainty over <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The awful massacre of 31 March, 1282, known as the <a href="15384a.htm">Sicilian Vespers</a>, had precluded every possibility of coming to an amicable understanding with <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>, a <a href="06166a.htm">Frenchman</a> who owed the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a> to Charles of Anjou. Pope Martin demanded unconditional submission to Charles of Anjou and the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and, when this was refused, put <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Pedro III under the ban, deprived Pedro of the <a href="03410b.htm">Kingdom of Aragon</a>, and gave it to Charles of Valois, the son of King Philip III of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. He, moreover, assisted Charles of Anjou in his attempts to recover <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by force of arms. The <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> not only repulsed the attacks of Charles of Anjou but also captured his son Charles of <a href="13396b.htm">Salerno</a>. On 6 January, 1285, Charles of Anjou died, leaving his captive son Charles of <a href="13396b.htm">Salerno</a> as his natural successor. Such were the conditions in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> when Honorius IV ascended the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. The <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> cherished the hope that the new pontiff would take a different stand from that of his predecessor in the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> question, but their hopes were only partly realized. He was indeed less impulsive and more peaceably inclined than <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>, but he did not renounce the claims of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the House of Anjou upon the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> crown. Neither did he set aside the severe <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> punishments imposed upon <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> or restore to Pedro III the <a href="03410b.htm">Kingdom of Aragon</a> which <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> had transferred to Charles of Valois. On the other hand, he did not approve of the tyrannical government to which the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> had been subject under Charles of Anjou. This is evident from his wise legislation as embodied in his constitution of 17 September, 1285 ("Constitutio super ordinatione regni Siciliae" in "Bullarium Romanum", <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>, IV, 70-80). In this constitution he inculcates that no government can prosper which is not founded on <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and peace, and he passes forty-five ordinances intended chiefly to protect the people of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> against their king and his officials. In case of any violation of these ordinances by the king or his officials, the people were free to appeal to the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> for redress. The king, moreover, was bound to observe the ordinances contained in this constitution under pain of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> had allowed King Philip III of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to tax the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and in a few <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, one-tenth of their revenues for the space of four years. The money thus collected was to be used for waging <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against Pedro III with the purpose of conquering <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> for Charles of Valois. Honorius IV approved this action of his predecessor. When Edward I of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> requested him to use his influence to put an end to the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, he answered that Pedro III deserved to be punished and that Philip III should not be kept from reaping the fruits of a <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> which he had undertaken in the service and at the instance of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The death of Pedro III on 11 November, 1285, somewhat changed the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> situation. His two sons Alfonso and James succeeded him, the former as King of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, the latter as King of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Honorius IV, of course, acknowledged neither the one nor the other. On 11 April, 1286, he solemnly <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> King James of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had taken part in his <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> at Palermo on 2 February, 1286; but neither the king nor the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> concerned themselves about the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The king even sent a hostile fleet to the Roman coast and destroyed the city of Astura by fire. Charles of <a href="13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, the lawful King of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, who was still held captive by the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilians</a>, finally grew tired of his long captivity and signed a contract on 27 February, 1287, in which he renounced his claims to the <a href="13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a> in favour of James of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> and his heirs. Honorius IV, however, who was asked for his approval, refused to listen to such an unprincipled act, which surrendered the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the House of Anjou to refractory rebels. He declared the contract invalid and forbade all similar agreements for the future. While Honorius IV was inexorable in the stand he had taken towards <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and its self-imposed king, his relations towards Alfonso of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> became less hostile. Through the efforts of King Edward I of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, negotiations for peace were begun by Honorius IV and King Alfonso. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, did not live long enough to complete these negotiations, which finally resulted in a peaceful settlement of the <a href="03410b.htm">Aragonese</a> as well as the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> question.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Rome and the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> enjoyed a period of tranquillity during the pontificate of Honorius IV, the like of which they had not enjoyed for many years. He had the satisfaction of reducing the most powerful and obstinate enemy of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, Count Guido of <a href="10528a.htm">Montefeltro</a>, who for many years had successfully resisted the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> troops. The authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was now recognized throughout the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> territory, which then comprised the Exarchate of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, the <a href="01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, the Duchy of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, the County of <a href="02522c.htm">Bertinoro</a>, the Mathildian lands, and the Pentapolis, viz. the cities of <a href="13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, <a href="11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, <a href="05785a.htm">Fano</a>, <a href="14013a.htm">Sinigaglia</a>, and <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. The Romans were greatly elated at the election of Honorius IV, for he was a citizen of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and a brother of Pandulf, who had during the preceding summer been elected one of the two annual senators of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The continuous disturbances in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the pontificate of <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> had not allowed that <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to reside in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but now the Romans cordially invited Honorius IV to make <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> his permanent residence. During the first few months of his pontificate he lived in the Vatican, but in the autumn of 1285 he removed to the magnificent palace which he had just erected on the Aventine. With Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> Honorius IV had few dealings beyond those that were of a purely <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character. On 16 March, 1286, he removed the <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> which had been imprudently placed upon <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> by <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> because that city had refused to equip a fleet for the service of Charles of Anjou in his <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against Pedro III of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. At Florence and Bergamo he brought about the abolition of some newly-made <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> that were hostile to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>.</p>

<p>The relations between Honorius IV and the German King Rudolf of Hapsburg were most cordial. The negotiations for Rudolf's imperial <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> which had been begun during the pontificate of <a href="01159a.htm">Adrian V</a> (1276) and continued during that of <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> (1277-1280) were entirely suspended during the pontificate of <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> (1281-1285) who had little <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>. Immediately upon the accession of Honorius IV these negotiations were resumed and the feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin, 2 February, 1287, was determined as the day on which Rudolf should be <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor in the <a href="13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> requested the German <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> to contribute a share of their revenues to cover the expenses of his journey to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He even sent Cardinal John of Tusculum, the only one who received the purple during the pontificate of Honorius, as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and the other countries of the north to hasten the king's Italian expedition, but Rudolf's <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with Count Eberhard of Wurtemberg and other dissensions in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> prevented his departure. The same <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> presided at the national council of <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, which began its sessions on 16 March, 1287. The decrees which were passed at this council are practically the same as those of the general council of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1274.</p>

<p>The two great <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> which at that time exerted great influence, both as <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the faithful and as professors at the great seats of learning in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, received many new privileges from Honorius IV. He also approved the privileges of the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> and the Augustinian <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> and permitted the former to exchange their striped habit for a white one. He was especially devoted to the <a href="15644b.htm">Williamites</a>, an order founded by St. William, Duke of Aquitaine (d. 1156), and added numerous privileges to those which they had already received from <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> and <a href="15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>. Besides turning over to them some deserted <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, he presented them with the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Paul at <a href="01255b.htm">Albano</a>, which he himself had founded and richly endowed when he was still <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. On 11 March, 1286, he condemned the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="01647a.htm">Apostolics</a> or <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> apostles, which had been started by a certain Gerard Segarelli at <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> in 1260. At the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> he advocated the erection of chairs for the Oriental languages in order to give an opportunity of studying these languages to those who intended to labour for the conversion of the <a href="10424a.htm">Musselmans</a> and the reunion of the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> churches in the East.</p>
