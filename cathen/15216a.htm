<p>Bartolomeo Prignano, the first Roman <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> during the <a href="13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>, born at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, about 1318; died at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 15 October, 1389; according to many he was poisoned by the Romans. At an early age he went to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he gained many powerful friends. On 21 March, 1364, he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="01101a.htm">Acerenza</a> in the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, and on 14 April, 1377, <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> transferred him to the archiepiscopal See of <a href="02295a.htm">Bari</a>, on the coast of the Adriatic. Meanwhile the Cardinal Vice-Chancellor, Peter of Pampelon, remaining at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, Prignano was given the management of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery. After the death of <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> the <a href="04192a.htm">Conclave</a> proposed him as a candidate for the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a>. Not only his business ability, integrity, and <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of law, but also his being a subject of Queen Joanna of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> favoured his eligibility. The <a href="04192a.htm">Conclave</a> of 1378, which opened on 7 April (nine days after <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory's</a> death), was influenced by the public opinion of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; it consisted of four <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, five French, and seven belonging to the Limoges faction. The Italian and <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, though anxious to push forward their own candidates, unanimously determined to oppose one of the Limoges party. The latter were not strong enough to advance a candidate, but they hoped to make an alliance with the less important parties and so attain their end. Their plan, however, was frustrated, the French and <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a> having previously resolved to choose a <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> outside the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. <a href="13096c.htm">Robert of Geneva</a> (one of the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>) even resigned his claim in favour of Prignano, and <a href="09431c.htm">Pedro de Luna</a> (<a href="13096c.htm">Robert's</a> successor in the <a href="02158a.htm">See of Avignon</a>) did the same. In this way Prignano's chances increased considerably. An Italian, though not a Roman, he was supported by the rivalry of the parties. Perhaps the French and <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> expected that, not being a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, he would be an obedient <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and for this reason some of the Limoges party, uneasy about the coalition between the French and the <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, were drawn to this candidature.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>This <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> was one of the shortest in history. When the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> entered the Vatican some of the populace stole into the palace and tried to extort the promise that an <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> would be chosen. Cardinal d'Aigrefeuille declared that the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> could not make any such concessions, but the disappointed people remained in the Vatican the whole night, drinking the wine and crying: "Romano lo volemo, o al manco Italiano." The next morning, while the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were at Mass, the tocsin was rung, and suddenly the bells of St. Peter mingled their tones with it. Fear and disorder overtook the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; the guardian of the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> besought them to hasten, saying that the people wanted a Roman or an Italian, and that the resistance would be dangerous. Then <a href="09431c.htm">Pedro de Luna (Benedict XIII)</a> proposed the election of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02295a.htm">Bari</a>, adding that he was, as they all <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a>, a saintly, learned man, of mature age. This proposal obtained the desired effect. After some hesitation, the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, excepting Orsini (who declared himself not sufficiently free), agreed to accept Prignano, but preferred to keep their choice secret until certain that the latter would accept. Prignano was requested to repair to the Vatican accompanied by several other <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, so as to conceal from the people the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> chosen. The uproar did not abate, and the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> began to fear that their choice would not satisfy the multitude. During a comparative calm they went to breakfast and renewed the election of Prignano. The lawfulness and renewed choice thus having been established, Orsini announced the election of a pope to the people, omitting to mention the name. Various suppositions soon ran through the crowds, some saying that the chosen one was Tebaldeschi (an aged <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>) and others that Jean de Bar (one of the most detested servants of <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory</a>) was elected. The confusion increased. Suddenly the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> took a desperate resolution. They presented Tebaldeschi, in the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> insignia, to the people and commenced the "Te Deum", paying no attention to his refusal and protests. Meanwhile, Prignano had reached the Vatican and declared that he accepted the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity and the homage of all the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. One fact seems evident: the moment the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> regarded the choice of Prignano as valid, they removed all <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> by a re-election and <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> him as the rightful <a href="12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that after his election Prignano did not show the good qualities which had distinguished him before. Soon he quarrelled with the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. Desirous of reforming the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in head and members, he began aright by a reform of the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>, though perhaps not with the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a>. It was unwise to abuse the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and high dignitaries of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and to insult Otto of Brunswick (husband of Joanna of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>). Nevertheless, public opinion was in the beginning favourable to him, and not only the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but also the six who remained at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> submitted to him. However the tempest, which broke out at Fondi in September of the same year, was already brewing at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> a few weeks after his election. Urban's ambassadors, doubtless inspired by the French and Limousin <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> too late, when the <a href="03190c.htm">calumnies</a> concerning the illegitimacy of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> election were widespread. The ground having thus been prepared, the opposition was strengthened at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Castel Sant'Angelo never hoisted Urban's colours, and the discontented found there a refuge and the protection of armed soldiers. The heat of early May afforded the dissatisfied <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> a pretext for leaving <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, but no public sign of rebellion showed itself, Urban's opponents preferring, perhaps, to conceal their project for the present. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> suspicions were eventually aroused, and in June he requested the three <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who had not followed the others to join their colleagues and to try and restore kinder feelings. The <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> renewed their protestation of fidelity to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, but assembled the same day to establish the unlawfulness of the April election. Moreover they eventually won over the Italian members of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Meanwhile, in the name of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, the aforesaid <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> proposed two expedients to settle the differences, a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> or a compromise. Both these means were made use of at the time of the <a href="13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>. But the opponents of Urban resolved on violent measures and declared their intentions in a letter of the utmost impertinence. On 2 August this letter was followed by the famous "Declaration", a document more passionate than exact, which assumed at once the parts of historian, jurist, and accuser. Seven days later they published an <a href="05413a.htm">encyclical</a> letter, repeating <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> and injurious accusations against Urban, and on 27 August left <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a> for Fondi, where they enjoyed the protection of its lord (Urban's arch-enemy), and were near Joanna of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>; the latter at first had shown great interest in Urban, but was soon disappointed by his capricious ways. On 15 September the three <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> joined their colleagues, influenced, perhaps, by the hope of becoming <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> themselves, or perhaps frightened by the news that Urban was about to create twenty-nine <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in order to supply the vacancies left by the thirteen French ones. Charles V of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, more and more <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> of the lawfulness of Urban's election, encouraged the Fondi faction to choose a rightful <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and one more agreeable to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. A letter from him arrived on 18 September, and hastened a violent solution. On 20 September <a href="13096c.htm">Robert of Geneva</a> was chosen <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and on this day the <a href="13539a.htm">Western Schism</a> began.</p>

<p>The <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a> abstained from the election but were convinced of its canonical character. <a href="13096c.htm">Robert</a> assumed the name of <a href="13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>. The obediences of the two <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> assumed definite limits between September, 1378, and June, 1379. All Western <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> (except <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and the English dominions in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>) submitted to <a href="13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>; the greater part of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> (with exception of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>) recognized Urban. The obedience of Urban was more numerous, that of Clement more imposing. Meanwhile, Urban created twenty-eight <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, four of whom refused to accept the purple. It is very difficult to decide exactly how far the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> is to be attributed to Urban's behaviour. Indisputably the long exile at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> was its principal cause, as it diminished the credit of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and inversely increased the <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, who were always striving to obtain more influence in the government of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Whatever may have been the causes of this event, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that the election of Urban was lawful, that of Clement uncanonical.</p>

<p>If the first days of Urban's pontificate were unhappy, his whole reign was a series of misadventures. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that he was successful in reducing Castel Sant' Angelo and subduing a revolt of the Romans, but these are the only successes of his reign. <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> was soon in turmoil. Queen Joanna went over to the Clementines and was deposed by Urban. Charles of <a href="05209a.htm">Durazzo</a> took her place. He arrested the queen and took possession of the kingdom, but soon lost favour with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> for not fulfilling his engagements towards Francesco Prignano (Urban's unworthy and immoral nephew), in whose regard Urban is not free from nepotism. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> now went to the south of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, against the advice of his <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, was received at <a href="02151a.htm">Aversa</a> by the king himself, but <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> on the night of his arrival (30 Oct., 1383). Through his <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> a compromise was reached, and Urban left <a href="02151a.htm">Aversa</a> for Nocera. Here he had to endure the most unworthy treatment from Margaret, the wife of Charles. The misunderstanding between Urban and Charles increased after the death of the latter's enemy, Louis of Anjou; the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, obstinate and intractable, continued in a half-hostile, half-dependent, attitude towards Charles, and created fourteen <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, only the Neapolitans accepting the dignity. He became daily more estranged from the older members of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. No one conversant with the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> current at this time in the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> will wonder that the example of 1378 found imitation. Highly irritated by Urban's inconsiderate behaviour, the Urbanist <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> mediated a more practical way of proceeding; they proposed to depose or, at least, arrest him. But their plot was revealed to him, and six of them were <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and their possessions confiscated. Those who did not confess were tortured, and the King and Queen of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, being suspected as accomplices, were <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. In consequence Nocera was besieged by the king. Urban <a href="06147a.htm">courageously</a> defended the place, two or three times a day <a href="01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> his foes from the ramparts. After nearly five months, Nocera was relieved by the Urbanists, Urban escaping to Barletta, whence a <a href="06419a.htm">Genoese</a> fleet transported him and the <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. During the voyage the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, one of the conspirators, was executed, and the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, excepting Adam Aston, were <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> at <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, in spite of the intervention of the doge. It may be taken for certain that the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> had conspired against Urban, with a view of deposing him; that they intended to burn him as an <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> may be a fantastic rumour. At all events he acted very unwisely by treating them so cruelly, for he then alienated faithful adherents, as is <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by the manifesto of the five <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, who remained at <a href="11086c.htm">Nocera</a> and renounced his obedience.</p>

<p>After King Charles was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> in <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (February, 1386) Urban again undertook to establish his authority in that kingdom; he left for Lucca, refused to treat with the dowager-queen Margaret, and declined the proposal of a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>, which some German princes proposed at the insistence of <a href="13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>, though he himself had formerly proposed the same expedient. He insulted the ambassadors and pressed the German king, Wenceslaus, to come to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In August, 1387, he proclaimed a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against Clement, and in September he set out for <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, where he remained till August, 1388, recruiting soldiers for a campaign against <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, which had again fallen into the hands of the Clementines, and the possession of which was very important for his own safety. The soldiers, not receiving their pay, deserted, and Urban returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where his refractory temper brought him into difficulties that could only be removed by an <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>. It was at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, also, that he fixed the interval between the jubilees at thirty-three years, the first of which was to be celebrated the next year, 1390. But he did not live to open it. Urban might have been a good <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in more peaceful circumstances; but he certainly was unable to heal the wounds which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had received during the exile of <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. If the genius of a <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> or an <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> was scarcely able to triumph over the <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, the bad conduct of the higher and lower <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the unruliness of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, these impediments could not but shipwreck the inconstant and quarrelsome Urban.</p>
