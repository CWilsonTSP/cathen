<p>Date of birth unknown, elected to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, 514; d. at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 6 August, 523.</p>

<p>This able and sagacious pontiff belonged to a <a href="15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and honourable <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Frosinone (Frusino) in the Campagna di Roma (Latium). Before receiving higher orders he had been married; his son became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of Silverius (536-537). Under <a href="14377a.htm">Pope Symmachus</a> (498-514) Hormisdas held the office of <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and during the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> of Laurentius he was one of the most prominent <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> attendants of Symmachus. He was notary at the <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> held at St. Peter's in 502, and Ennodius of Pavia, with whom he was on friendly terms, expressed the conviction that this Roman <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, so eminent for <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, wealth, and distinguished birth, would occupy the <a href="07424b.htm">See of Rome</a> [Ennodii opera, ed. Vogel (Berlin, 1885), 287, 290]. The day after the funeral of Symmachus (20 July, 514) Hormisdas was chosen and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his successor; there is no mention of divisions or disturbances at his election. One of the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> first cares was to remove the last vestiges of the Laurentian <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, receiving back into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> such of its adherents as had not already been reconciled. From the beginning of his pontificate the affairs of the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> occupied his special attention. At Constantinople the <a href="01079b.htm">Acacian schism</a>, which had broken out in consequence of the <a href="07218b.htm">"Henoticon"</a> of the Emperor Zeno, and which had caused the separation of the Greek and Roman Churches, still held sway (see <a href="01082a.htm">A<font size=-2>CACIUS</font>, PA<font size=-2>TRIARCH OF</font> C<font size=-2>ONSTANTINOPLE</font></a>). The Emperor Anastasius (491-518), Zeno's successor, maintained the <a href="07218b.htm">"Henoticon"</a>; he became more and more inclined towards <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, and <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who refused to repudiate the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. The three <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, Macedonius of Constantinople, <a href="05385a.htm">Elias of Jerusalem</a>, and Flavianus of Antioch had been driven from their <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the midst of this confusion a number of Eastern <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> appealed to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the pontificate of Symmachus, in order that, by the restoration of unity in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, their positions might be strengthened and the progress of <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> checked. Symmachus had required them to submit to the condemnation of Acacius, but the Orientals were not ready for this step. Taking advantage of the discontent aroused against Anastasius by his <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> tendencies, Vitalian of Lower Moesia, a commander in the army, led a revolt against him. Vitalian demanded, on the one hand, that his office of distribution of the grain for the troops should be restored to him, and, on the other, that the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> should be recognized and the unity with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> re-established. He gained numerous adherents and appearing before Constantinople at the head of a large army, defeated the emperor's nephew, Hypatius; upon this Anastasius was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to negotiate with him. One of the terms of Vitalian's submission was that the emperor should take an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to convene a synod at <a href="07242b.htm">Heraclea</a> in Thrace, invite the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to attend it, and submit to his arbitration the dispute about the <a href="04301a.htm">See of Constantinople</a> and the other <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in order by this means to restore the <a href="15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>. Anastasius accordingly wrote to Hormisdas, 28 Dec., 514, inviting him to the synod on the first of July following. The letter had first to be submitted to Vitalian, whose representative accompanied the bearer to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. A second, less courteous communication, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 Jan., was sent by Anastasius to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; this merely requested his good offices in the controversy. The emperor evidently wished to prolong the negotiations as he was not really willing to fulfill the promises he had made to Vitalian. The second letter reached <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the first one, and on 4 April Hormisdas answered it, expressing his delight at the prospect of peace, but at the same time defending the memory of his predecessors. The bearers of the emperor's first letter arrived on 14 May. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> guardedly carried on negotiations, convened a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and wrote a letter to the emperor, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 8 July, in which he announced the departure of an embassy for Constantinople. Meanwhile the two hundred <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had assembled on 1 July at <a href="07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>, separated without accomplishing anything.</p>

<p>The <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> embassy to the imperial court consisted of two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Ennodius of Pavia and Fortunatus of Catina, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Venantius, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> Vitalis, and the notary Hilarius. The letter of Hormisdas to the emperor, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 Aug., 515, is still preserved; so also are the minute instructions given the <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> with regard to the position they were to take. If the emperor agreed to the proposals made to him, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was ready, if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to appear in person at a council. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> further sent the formula of a confession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>regula fidei</em>) for the Eastern <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to sign. The embassy brought about no real results; Anastasius, without breaking off the negotiations, gave the envoys an evasive letter for Hormisdas. A new revolt of Vitalian was suppressed, and an imperial embassy, consisting of two high civil officials, came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> bringing a letter <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 16 July, 516, for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and one <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 28 July, for the Roman Senate; the aim of the latter was to induce the senators to take a stand against Hormisdas. The senate, however, as well as <a href="14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a>, remained true to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who saw through the emperor's crafty manoeuvres. The answer of Hormisdas to the imperial letter was dignified and definite. Meanwhile an additional number of Scythian, Illyrian and Dardanian <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had entered into relations with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and several of them had also conferred with the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a> in Constantinople upon the question of the reunion of the Churches. They now submitted to the condemnation of Acacius and signed the confession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (regula fidei) of Hormisdas, as did also the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Epirus, who were persuaded thereto by the Roman <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> Pullio. This confession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> sent to Constantinople to be signed by all <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who reunited with the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, is known as the "Formula Hormisdae" and was repeatedly mentioned at the [First] <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. It begins with the words: "Prima salus est, regulam rectae fidei custodire et a constitutis Patrum nullatenus deviare. Et quia non potest Domini Nostri Jesu Christi praetermitti sententia dicentis: Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam. Haec quae dicta sunt rerum probantur effectibus, quia in sede apostolica immaculata est semper Catholica conservata religio" (The first means of safety is to guard the rule of strict <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and to deviate in no way from those things that have been laid down by the Fathers. And indeed the words of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>: "Thou art <a href="11744a.htm">Peter</a>; and upon this rock I will build my church" [<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18</a>], cannot be disregarded; these things which were spoken are demonstrated by the results, for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion has been preserved ever immaculate in the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>). Then follows the condemnation of Nestorius and the other heresiarchs and also of Acacius.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>A second <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> embassy consisting of Ennodius of Pavia and Bishop Peregrinus of Misenum had no better success. Anastasius even attempted to <a href="02778c.htm">bribe</a> the <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a>, in which, however, he was unsuccessful. They sought on the contrary to circulate secretly the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> letters summoning the people to reunite with the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. When the emperor heard of it he had them brought out of the city by a private gate to the seashore, put on shipboard, and sent back to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Then Anastasius, who had momentarily nothing to fear from Vitalian, wrote an insolent letter to Hormisdas <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 11 July, 517, breaking off the negotiations, and continued to persecute the advocates of union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 9 July, 518, he died very suddenly in the midst of a terrible storm. Shortly before that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> Timotheus, the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, had also passed away. The Emperor Justin I (518-527), who succeeded, was an <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. The people of Constantinople insisted that the new Patriarch John should <a href="01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, recognize the definition of Chalcedon, and reunite the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. A synod, held at Constantinople, concurred in these views and an imperial envoy departed for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to entreat the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> on behalf of the emperor, the latter's nephew Justinian, and the patriarch to come in person to the Orient, or send a <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> for the purpose of re-establishing the <a href="15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>. Hormisdas appointed the Bishops [Saint] Germanus [of <a href="03319a.htm">Capua</a>] and John, a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Blandus, two <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, Felix and Dioscurus, and a notary, Peter. They had the same instructions and confession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> which were given the <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> of 515. The embassy was received in Constantinople with great splendour. All the demands of the pontiff were conceded; the name of the condemned Patriarch Acacius as well as the names of the Emperors Anastasius and Zeno were stricken from the church <a href="05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, the Patriarch John accepted the formula of Hormisdas. On <a href="10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, 28 March, 519, in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Constantinople in presence of a great throng of people, the reunion of the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was ratified in the most solemn manner. The greater number of the Eastern and Greek <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> approved and signed the formula of Hormisdas. At Antioch an <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> patriarch was chosen to replace the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> Severus.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this activity for the establishment of peace a new quarrel broke out, which turned upon the formula: "One of the Trinity was crucified". It was <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> at Constantinople in 519 by <a href="10073a.htm">John Maxentius</a> and numerous Scythian <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who were upheld by Justinian (Theopaschite controversy). The patriarch and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> opposed the demand that this formula should be embodied as a <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> then proceeded to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> where they caused some trouble; they also addressed the African <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> then residing in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. In 521 Hormisdas pronounced that the formula in question, although not <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>, was dangerous because it admitted of a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation; that the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> needed no amendment. About this time the African Bishop Possessor, at the instigation of some African <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, appealed to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> for information regarding the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> attitude towards the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Riez, Provence, whose <a href="13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a> views coloured his writings. In his reply Hormisdas severely rebuked the quarrelsome spirit of these <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. He did not forbid the reading of the works of Faustus, but decided that what was good in them should be preserved and what was contrary to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> should be rejected.</p>

<p>Hormisdas caused a Latin translation of the canons of the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> to be prepared by <a href="05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> and issued a new edition of the Gelasian "Decretum de recipiendis Libris". He sent letters to several <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Gaul on <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters and gave directions regarding church administration. His relations with <a href="14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> were amicable. The <a href="09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> enumerates valuable gifts presented to St. Peter's by this king as well as by the Emperor Justin.</p>

<p>Shortly before his death the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> received tidings that Thrasamund the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandal</a> King of Northern Africa had died (523), and that the severe <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in that region had consequently ceased. Hormisdas was buried at St. Peter's. The text of his epitaph has been preserved (<a href="04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Inscriptiones Christianae urbis Romae", II, 130).</p>
