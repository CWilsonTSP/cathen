<p>(LES FILLES DE LA SAGESSE).</p>

<p>Founded at <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> by <a href="09384a.htm">Blessed Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort</a> in 1703. While he was temporary <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> in 1707, he associated into a little community some <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> but variously afflicted girls, and gave them a rule of life, the main points of which have been retained in the Rule of the Daughters of Wisdom. In their meeting-room, called by Montfort <em>La Sagesse</em> (wisdom), he placed a large wooden cross, to indicate that <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom is in the "foolishness" of the cross. This community of poor, crippled, blind, and sickly girls was destined, under <a href="12510a.htm">God's providence</a>, to give a solid religious training to Louise Trichet, known in religion as Sister Marie-Louise of Jesus. When de Montfort judged her sufficiently advanced in virtue, he gave her a new religious habit, which has been minutely copied by the Daughters of Wisdom. It consists of an ashen-gray woollen dress and a black cape worn over the habit. Their coif and neckerchief are of white linen. They wear slippers instead of shoes. Ten years she alone wore the much-ridiculed dress. In 1712 a companion was given to Marie-Louise in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of Catharine Brunet (Sister Conception). In 1715, at the request of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>, de Montfort called upon his spiritual daughters to teach the children of the poor in that city. Henceforth the congregation was both hospitaller and teaching. The founder appointed Sister Marie-Louise superioress of the congregation. On 22 Aug., 1715, Montfort gave the habit of Wisdom to Sister Ste Croix and Sister Incarnation.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The congregation strives to acquire heavenly wisdom by imitating the Incarnate Wisdom, <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. The means for imitating Christ is a special <a href="15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>. De Montfort calls it "True Devotion" or "Holy Bondage of Mary", because it mainly consists (1) in consecrating themselves entirely to <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and (2) in serving her lovingly as a slave. The saint, with his keen perception of Mary's greatness and our own unworthiness, preferred the appellation "slave or bondman" to "child or servant of Mary". Once <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Mary, the sisters perform all their actions in the spirit inculcated in de Montfort's "Treatise of the True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin". When he died in 1716, the community numbered only four sisters. In 1720 the site of their mother-house was acquired at Saint-Laurent-sur-Sevre, where he was laid to rest. Henceforth the life of Marie-Louise was to be a series of travels necessitated by new foundations and by visits to all her communities; in 1750 there were already thirty. She died on 27 April, 1759. Under her successor, Sister Anastasie (1759-68), lay sisters were admitted into the congregation. They wear a black habit, a brown kerchief on weekdays, and a white one on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. When in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> or out of the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> they wear a black cape. The lay sisters are over 700. Art. 26 of the first part of the constitution provides that both lay and choir sisters, at the end of five years probation, be sent to the mother-house (at Saint-Laurent-sur-S&egrave;vre, La Vend&eacute;e, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>), where they remain about two months preparing themselves for their perpetual <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>.</p>

<p>On 31 Jan., 1794, twenty-six sisters, who had remained in the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at Saint-Laurent-sur-Sevre, were fastened two and two like criminals. One was hacked to pieces; another slain in her sick-bed, and her corpse dragged through the village. The others were thrown into a squalid <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> at <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, where eight of them died of starvation. One sister was <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> at Coron; another was wounded by a sabre-cut, and left for dead; two were massacred at Longeron, and two more on the road to <a href="09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>. Of those <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> there, four died of exhaustion. At Poitiers three sisters were exhibited in a public square and the inscription "Harbourers of fanatic priests" placed above their heads. They spent eight months in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> at Le Brouage; they were forced, in the cold winter months, to uproot with their hands the grass that grew between the paving-stones of the streets. At <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a> two sisters were guillotined. At Rennes the heads of Sister V&eacute;ronique and Jouin fell under the guillotine. Three others, meanwhile exhibited with an iron collar (<em>carcan</em>) around their necks, when apprised of the execution of their companions, and threatened with a similar fate, simply replied: "God's holy Will be done". At La Cuille Sister St. Emily was subjected to revolting maltreatment. Sister St. Eugenie's <a href="06147a.htm">fortitude</a> astonished the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolutionary</a> Committee of <a href="09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>. "Enough, gentlemen, my last word is this: the guillotine seems set up for good. Take me there. An <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> against my <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> you will never get from me." On being promised personal safety, she besought her judges not to be separated from her companions. She was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at <a href="03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. At Rochefort-en-Terre Sister Mechtilde died of fright at seeing the <a href="13009a.htm">revolutionaries</a>. Her three companions, <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, were refused even a little straw to lie on. From the <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> the superioress addressed a pathetic appeal to the municipality. Relief came too late, at least for her. She died after a year's <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. Her two companions were set free. Still when nurses were needed to take care of the wounded and sick soldiers in the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Brest, the <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> sisters, 70 in number, were sent there. They were the first to resume the religious habit in 1800.</p>

<p>Under <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> the Daughters of Wisdom recovered most of their former houses, were granted 30,000 francs for building purposes, and an annuity of 12,000 francs. This was faithfully paid until 1848. It was in 1810, when <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> was temporarily the master of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, that, at his call, the Sisters of Wisdom left French soil for the first time to nurse the wounded soldiers at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. Numerous medals were bestowed on the congregation by <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, and by every French Government since; <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> have <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> them for nursing the wounded or plague-stricken soldiers of those countries; as a congregation they have been acknowledged in the <a href="03052b.htm">Apostolic Brief</a> of <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> in 1825; they were canonically approved, together with the Fathers of the Company of Mary, in 1853; they were placed under Cardinal Vincenze Vanntuelli as protector, and favoured by two important decrees in 1893 and 1898 securing the integrity of Montfort's institution; and they received the definitive <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the constitutions of Montfort's double foundation in 1904.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1800 the membership of the community was 260; in 1810, 509; in 1830, 710; in 1840, 1400. Today there are 5400, distributed among 430 houses. Their principal <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> is the mother-house. The present French Government has replaced them by lay nurses in the important naval and military <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of Toulon, Brest, Cherbourg, Boulogne, and others, in the state <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a>, in the Maisons Centrales (prisons for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>) of Cadillac and <a href="04053a.htm">Clermont</a>. Not less than 250 of their <a href="13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> have been closed. They are in charge of <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="08038b.htm">insane asylums</a>, orthopaedic institutes, <a href="11322b.htm">orphan homes</a>, training <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, apprentice shops, protectories, poor-houses, <a href="09524a.htm">magdalen</a> institutions, kindergartens, day nurseries, boarding-schools, day-schools, and <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The Asile des Vieillards, founded at Clamart (Paris) by Duchess Galiera, deserves a special mention for the uniqueness of its purpose. It is a home for aged and indigent artists, literary and scientific men, or noblemen.</p>

<p>In 1812 the Daughters of Wisdom took charge of the institution for deaf-mutes at La Chartreuse d'Auray. Trained by Miss Duler and by the Abb&eacute; Sicard, the sisters made rapid progress in this new field of usefulness. They improved the methods of their masters, and, in turn, became the teachers of several other <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. Today the Daughters of Wisdom direct the institutes of the blind and deaf-mutes in seven departments; at La Chartreuse, Larnay, <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a>, Laon, <a href="02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, and <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Larnay gained world-wide renown after the publication of Louis Arnould's "Une ame en prison", in which he graphically describes the method pursued by Sister Marguerite for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of Marie Heurtin, deaf-mute and blind from her birth. Before Sister Marguerite, Sister St. M&eacute;dulle had worked on similar lines, in instructing Germaine Cambon and Marthe Obrecht. What the famous Abb&eacute; de l'Ep&eacute;e considered almost impossible has been successfully accomplished by Sisters St. Medulle and Marguerite, and is <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> continued by the Daughters of Wisdom. Marie Herutin herself has been very serviceable in teaching her similarly afflicted companions. The deaf-mutes of Larnay manufacture, under the direction of their teachers, church vestments which experts have declared to rival the products of the ateliers of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. A unique religious congregation, "the Little Religious of Our Lady of the Seven Dolours", sprang from the Larnay Institute. It was founded in 1849 for the deaf-mutes of Larnay by Canon de Larnay, and approved by Cardinal Pie. Since 1898 it has been affiliated to the Daughters of Wisdom. Their rule has been approved by <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>.</p>
