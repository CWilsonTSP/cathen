<p><a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia, died c. 269. He had among his contemporaries a reputation comparable to that of Dionysius or <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>. <a href="07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> tells us that <a href="07015a.htm">St. Gregory the Wonder-Worker</a>, then a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a>, having completed his secular studies, "fell in with Firmilian, a Cappadocian of noble <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, similar to himself in character and talent, as he showed in his subsequent life when he adorned the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of C&aelig;sarea." The two young men agreed in their desire to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> more of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and came to <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, whose disciples they became, and by whom <a href="07015a.htm">Gregory</a>, at least, was <a href="02258b.htm">baptised</a>. Firmilian was more probably brought up as a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Later, when <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> tells us, he had such a <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> that he invited him to his own country for the benefit of the Churches, at the time (232-5) when the great teacher was staying in C&aelig;sarea of Palestine, on account of his <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> displeasure at his having been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in that city. Firmilian also went to him subsequently and stayed with him some time that he might advance in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> (<a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.28.1</a>). He was an opponent of the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, for Dionysius in 252-3 writes that Helenus of <a href="14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, Firmilian, and Theoctistus of C&aelig;sarea in Palestine (that is, the Metropolitans of Cilicia, Cappadocia, and Palestine) had invited him to a synod at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, where some were trying to support the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a> (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.46.3</a>). Dionysius counts Firmilian as one of "the more eminent <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>" in a letter to <a href="14288a.htm">Pope Stephen</a> (ibid., VII, v, 1), where his expression "Firmilian and all Cappadocia" again implies that C&aelig;sarea was already a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="10244c.htm">see</a>. This explains why Firmilian could invite <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> to Cappadocia, "for the benefit of the Churches".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In a letter to <a href="14031c.htm">Pope Sixtus II</a> (257-8), Dionysius mentions that <a href="14288a.htm">Pope St. Stephen</a> in the <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> controversy had refused to communicate with Helenus of <a href="14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, Firmilian, and all Cilicia and Cappadocia, and the neighbouring lands (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VII, v, 3-4). We learn the cause of this from the only writing of St. Firmilian's which remains to us. When the <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> controversy arose, <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> wished to gain support from the Churches of the East against <a href="14288a.htm">Pope Stephen</a> for his own decision to rebaptize all <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> who returned to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. At the end of the summer of 256, he sent the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> Rogatian to Firmilian with a letter, together with the documents on the subject&mdash;letters of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, of his own, and of his council at Carthage in the spring, and the treatise "De Eccl. Cath. Unitate". Firmilian's reply was received at Charthage about the middle of November. It is a long letter, even more bitter and violent than that of <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> to Pompeius. It has come down to us in a translation made, no doubt, under <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> direction, and apparently very literal, as it abounds in Gr&aelig;cisms (Ep. lxxv among <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> letters). St. Cpyrian's arguments against <a href="14288a.htm">St. Stephen</a> are reiterated and reinforced, and the treatise on Unity is laid under contribution. It is particularly interesting to note that the famous fourth chapter of that treatise must have been before the writer of the letter in its original form, and not in the alternative "Roman" form (c. xvi). It is the literal <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> when Firmilian says: "We have received your writings as our own, and have committed them to memory by repeated reading" (c. iv)</p>

<p>The reasoning against the validity of <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> is mainly that of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, that those who are outside the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and have not the Holy Spirit cannot admit others to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or give what they do not possess. Firmilian is fond of dilemmas: for instance, either the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> do not give the Holy Ghost, in which case rebaptism is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, or else they do give it, in which case <a href="14288a.htm">Stephen</a> should not enjoin the <a href="07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>. It is important that Firmilian enables us to gather much of the drift of <a href="14288a.htm">St. Stephen's</a> letter. It is "ridiculous" that <a href="14288a.htm">Stephen</a> demanded nothing but the use of the Trinitarian formula. He had appealed to tradition from St. Peter and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>: this is an insult to the Apostles, cries Firmilian, for they execrated <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Besides (this is from Cyprian, Ep. lxxiv, 2), "no one could be so silly as to believe this", for the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> are all later than the Apostles! And <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> has not preserved the Apostolic traditions unchanged, for it differs from <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> as to the observances at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and as to other mysteries. "I am justly indignant with <a href="14288a.htm">Stephen's</a> obvious and manifest silliness, that he so boasts of his position, and claims that he is the <a href="12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a> on whom were laid the foundations of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; yet he brings in many other rocks, and erects new buildings of many Churches when he defends with his authority the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> conferred by <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>; for those who are <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> are without <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> numbered in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and he who approves their <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> affirms that there is among them a Church of the <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>.&hellip; <a href="14288a.htm">Stephen</a>, who declares that he has the Chair of Peter by succession, is excited by no <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> against <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>" (c. xvii). "You have cut yourself off&mdash;do not mistake&mdash;since he is the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> who makes himself an <a href="01624b.htm">apostate</a> from the communion of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity. For in thinking that all can be <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by you, you have cut off yourself alone from the communion of all" (c. xxiv).</p>

<p>We thus learn the claims of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to impose on the whole Church by his authority as successor of Peter, a custom derived by the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> from <a href="15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a>. Firmilian tells the Africans that with them the custom of rebaptizing may be new, but in Cappadocia it is not, and he can answer <a href="14288a.htm">Stephen</a> by opposing tradition to tradition, for it was their practice from the beginning (c. xix); and some time since, he had joined in a council at <a href="07619a.htm">Iconium</a> with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Galatia and Cilicia and other provinces, and had decided to rebaptize the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a> (c. vii and xix). Dionysius, in a letter to the Roman <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Philemon, also mentions the Council of <a href="07619a.htm">Iconium</a> with one of <a href="14387a.htm">Synnada</a> "among many". It was presumably held in the last years of <a href="13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a>, c. 231-5. Firmilian also took part in the two councils of 264-5 at Antioch which deposed <a href="11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>. He may even have presided. The letter of the third council says he was too easily persuaded that Paul would amend; hence the necessity of another council (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.3-5</a>). He was on his way to this assembly when death overtook him at <a href="14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>. This was in 268 (Harnack) or 269. Though he was cut off from communion by <a href="14288a.htm">Pope Stephen</a>, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that the following <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> did not adhere to this severe policy. He is commemorated in the Greek <a href="10177b.htm">Men&aelig;a</a> on 28 Oct., but is unknown to the Western <a href="09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>. His great successor, <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, mentions his view on <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> without accepting it (Ep. clxxxviii), and says, when speaking of the expression "with the Holy Ghost" in the Doxology: "That our own Firmilian held this <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> is testified by the books [<em>l&oacute;goi</em>] which he has left" (De. Spir. Sanc., xxix, 74). We hear nothing else of such writings, which were probably letters.</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;BOSSUE, in <em>Acta SS.,</em> 28 Oct., gives an elaborate dissertation on this saint; BENSON in <em>Dict. Christ. Biog.</em>; the genuineness of the letter was arbitrarily contested by MISSORIUS, <em>In Epist. ad Pomp. inter Cypr.</em> (Venice, 1733), and by MOLKENBUHR, <em>Bin&#230; diss. de S. Firm.</em> (M&#252;nster, 1790, and in <em>P.L.,</em> III, 1357); RITSCHL, <em>Cyprian v. Karth</em> (G&#246;ttingen, 1895), argued that the letter had been interpolated at Carthage in the interests of Cyprian's party; so also HARNACK in <em>Gesch. der altchr. Lit.</em> (Leipzig, 1893), I, 407, and SODEN, <em>Die cyprianische Briefsammlung</em> (Berlin, 1904); this was disproved by ERNST, <em>Die Echtheit des Briefes Firmilians</em> in <em>Zeitschr. f&#252;r kath. Theol.</em> (1894), XVIII, 209, and <em>Zur Frage &#252;ber die Echheit des Briefs F.'s an Cyprian</em> (<em>ibid.,</em> XX, 364), also by BENSON, <em>Cyprian</em> (London, 1897), p. 377, and Harnack later expressed himself convinced (<em>Gesch.,</em> II, ii, p. 359, 1904). MOSES OF CHORENE, <em>Hist. Arm.,</em> II, lxxv, attributed to Firmilian "many books, among them a history of the persecutions of the Church in the days of Maximus, Decius and later of Diocletian". This is a mistake. It seems there were letters from Firmilian in the published correspondence of Origen, according to St. Jerome's version of the list of Origen's works by Pamphilus and Eusebius: "Origenis Firmiani [<em>sic</em>] et Gregorii" [ed. by KLOSTERMANN, <em>Sitzungsberichte der Real-Akad</em> (Berlin, 1897); see HARNACK, <em>op. cit.,</em> II, ii, p. 47]; the letter to Gregory Thaum. is extant. A fragment of a letter from Origen to Firmilian, cited by VICTOR OF CAPUA, was published by PITRA, <em>Spic. Solesm.,</em> I, 268. St. Augustine seems not to have known the letter to Cyprian, but CRESCONIUS seems to have referred to it, <em>C. Cresc.,</em> iii, 1 and 3.
