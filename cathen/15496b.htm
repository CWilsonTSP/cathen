<p>(VISENSIS).</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in north central <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> dates from the sixth century and including the <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> and those elected but not confirmed, it has had eighty- three <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The list begins with Remissol (572-585) who attended the Second Council of <a href="02728a.htm">Braga</a>, but was exiled by the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> King Leovigild. Tunila succeeded him and <a href="01044d.htm">abjured</a> <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a> at the Third Council of Toledo; <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Viseu were present at the fourth, sixth, eighth, twelfth, and thirteenth councils of Toledo. There was a vacancy of fifteen years from 665 to 680; Theofredo was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 693. Then, owing to the invasion of the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, Vizeu remained without a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for nearly two centuries. Theodomiro assisted at the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the church of Santiago de Compostella in 876, and at the Council of <a href="11363a.htm">Oviedo</a> in 877 and was followed by Gundemiro in 905. In this century Vizeu was occupied by the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> during seventy-six years and at first had no <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but afterwards its <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, Gomes and Sisnando (1020-1064), resided in <a href="11363a.htm">Oviedo</a>. From 1110 to 1144 the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was governed by <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a> appointed by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Coimbra, in virtue of a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Paschall II; among them was Saint Theotonio, afterwards patron of the city. The line of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> began again with Odorio.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Nicolau (1193), a future canon regular, studied in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and there met the future <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, who after his election to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> received him at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and recommended him to the queen for his learning and modesty. Martinho was appointed in 1230; after his death the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> until 1250, when Pedro Gonvalves was confirmed in it. Matheus I (1254) took part in the long conflicts between Crown and Church, which had begun in the reign of King Alfonso II, and in defence of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="07690a.htm">immunities</a> went with other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, dying at Vitebo. After eight years, during which <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was under <a href="08073a.htm">interdicts</a>, Matheus II filled the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, and he was followed by Egas I (1259), an active reformer, and Martinho II (1313). This <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> carried out important work in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which dates at least from 830, when King Ferdinand the Great recaptured the city from the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a>; it was almost reconstructed early in the twelfth century. Gon&ccedil;alo de Figueiredo (1323), who had been married before entering the church, is remembered as the founder of many noble <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>; his successor Miguel Vivas (1330) served as chancellor to Alfonso IV.</p>

<p>After Jo&atilde;o III (1375), "of good memory", came two <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, Pedro II and Jo&atilde;o IV, whose rule was brief on account of the Great Schism, the former being deposed by <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>. A fifth Jo&atilde;o followed in the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> in 1392 and, being highly esteemed by the king, was chosen godfather of Prince Henry the Navigator, and received from the monarch the gift of a Roman tower for the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> bells. Luiz do Amaral, the only <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> native of the city, represented <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> at the Council of Basel, and, embracing the cause of the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, was sent on various embassies; he returned however to the lawful obedience before his death. Luiz Coutinho II (1438) was promoted to Coimbra in 1446, being followed by Jo&atilde;o Vicente (founder of the Loyos, a congregation of secular canons of St. John), who was known as "the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>". He reformed the Order of Christ and gave it new <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> by order of Prince Henry, Duke of Vizeu, the grand-master. Cardinal d'Alpedrinha, the richest and most influential of Portuguese <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, lived at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from 1479 and dying there in 1508 was buried in his splendid <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> in Santa Maria del Popolo. Diego Ortiz de Vilhegas (1507), a <a href="03410b.htm">Castilian</a>, was confessor of three kings and renowned as a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, orator, and <a href="02018e.htm">astrologer</a>. He took part in the <em>Junta</em> called by King Manuel to consider the offer <a href="04140a.htm">Columbus</a> had made to discover the Indies by sailing west and procured its rejection, which transferred from <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> the glory of finding America. He built a new and splendid front to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it in June, 1516. In 1520 Alfonso, sixth son of King Manuel, became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vizeu at the age of eleven, and in his time books began to be kept for the registration of births, deaths, and <a href="09707a.htm">marriages</a>, a custom afterwards enjoined by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. He was followed, among others, by Cardinal Miguel da Silva (1527), and Cardinal Alexander Farnese (1547), who never came to the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which he renounced in 1552. Gon&ccedil;alo Pinheiro (1553), famous classical scholar, ambassador to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and subsequently <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, held a synod in 1555, and made notable additions to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Jorge de Athaide (1568) assisted at the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and in the reform of the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and built the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13322b.htm">sacristy</a> and part of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace; of noble <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, he refused four archbishoprics and left his residuary estate to the poor.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Miguel de Castro (1579), also a noble, was Viceroy of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> under the Spanish domination, and renowned for almsdeeds. On his transfer to <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, Nuno de Noronha, son of the Count of Odemira, became <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1585) and built the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, doing the same for Guarda to which he was promoted. He was a notable reformer of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and lived like the great <em>fidalgo</em> he was. The virtuous <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and Greek scholar Antonio de Sousa (1595) ruled only two years, being followed by Jo&atilde;o de Braganza, a model courtier and <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, who gave his wealth to the poor. Jo&atilde;o Manual (1610) son of the Count of Castanheira, after a personal visitation of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1611, drew up constitutions which were approved at a synod in 1614 and he subsequently became <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and viceroy. Jo&atilde;o de <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (1626), a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> of noble birth and saintly life, made a visitation of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> and finding most of his people <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, wrote and distributed a summary of it. It was remarked that he gave nothing to his relations, saying that the income of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> should be spent upon it and its children, the poor. Bernardino de Senna (1629), a <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, had held important posts in his order in different parts of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, whither he travelled on foot begging <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>, and he had refused two mitres. Becoming general he lived at <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a> with free entry to the palace, although dressed in rags. <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> named him minister general, and at the age of fifty-eight when he had visited and governed 6000 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> and 280,000 subjects, King Philip presented him to the See of Vizeu. Miguel de Castro IV (1633) never took possession, but Diniz de Mello e Castro (1636) in his two years' rule was diligent in his pastoral office, especially in visitations, and was a great benefactor of the Misericordias of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. For the next thirty-two years the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a>, owing to the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> following on the proclamation of Portuguese independence. Through Spanish pressure, the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> refused to confirm the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> named by King Jo&atilde;o IV and during eleven years <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and colonies had only one <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the others, appointed under the Philips, having died. This energetic man, who lived until one hundred and nine, is said to have <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> 20,000 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and confirmed a million <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. Finally peace was made with <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and in 1671 Manuel de Saldanha became <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> but died three months later and in 1673 Jo&atilde;o de Mello, a noble and man of greatest austerity, succeeded. He rebuilt the <a href="03572b.htm">chancel</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, convened a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> in 1681, added to the constitutions of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and employed the <a href="11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> in giving missions. <a href="13231b.htm">Ricardo Russell</a>, an Englishman, <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Queen Catherine, wife of Charles II, was translated from <a href="12283c.htm">Portalegre</a> in 1685 and established that congregation in Vizeu. He left the reputation of being a man of <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and illustration, and though a severe disciplinarian, of ready wit.</p>

<p>Jeronymo Soares (1694), a generous benefactor of the Misericordia, convoked a synod in 1699 and reformed the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> constitutions and those of many brotherhoods and confraternities. After his death the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> twenty years owing to differences between King Jo&atilde;o V and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1740 Julio Francisco de Oliveira was appointed. Jos&eacute; do Menino Jesus (1783), a <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, was a lover of art, as he showed by the <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> he presented to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He made two visitations of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> and was succeeded by Francisco de Azevedo (1792), a <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> of great modesty and charity, who instituted five suburban <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> annexed to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and subsidized the rectors out of his own funds. He gave a new <a href="11297a.htm">organ</a> costing 20,000 <em>crusados</em> to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and laid the foundation-stone of the new <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> of the Misericordia. This rule was troubled by the Peninsular War and in 1810 British troops occupied his palace and other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings. Francisco Alexandre Lobo (1810), famous for his learning and writings, was minister under King Miguel and, when the <a href="09212a.htm">Liberals</a> triumphed in 1834, had to <a href="10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> where he remained ten years. The new Government refused to recognize the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to whom he had confided the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, naming another, which gave rise to a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> and cruel <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Jos&eacute; Xavier da Cerveira e Sousa (1859) abandoned the diocese through his inability to secure obedience from his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the matter of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> dress and was followed by Antonio Alves Martins (1862), a <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> who espoused the Liberal cause and fought in the civil <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against King Miguel. A talented, energetic, and charitable man and a great orator, he gave his life to politics and was journalist, deputy, peer, and prime minister. He was a strong opponent of the <a href="07790a.htm">Infallibility</a> <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> at the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> and his independence gained him the admiration of the Portuguese <a href="09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, who have recently erected a <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of him in Vizeu. He was followed by Jos&eacute; Dias Correa de Carvalho (1883), translated from the See of Cabo Verde, where he was the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to visit all the churches of the archipelago. The present <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, Mgr. Antonio Alves-Ferreira dos Sontos, is his immediate successor.</p>
