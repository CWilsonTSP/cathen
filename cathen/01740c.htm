<p>The popular designation of the doctrines held by a party formed in the early days of the seventeenth century among the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> of the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. The tendency of the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> to revolt against <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> <em>decretum horrible</em> of <a href="12376b.htm">predestination absolute</a> and <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> and damnation meted out without regard to merit or demerit had aroused opposition in thinking minds from the first <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>; but whilst the fanatical <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion engrossed the attention of the masses, thinking minds were few and uninfluential. <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> reckless tenets had banished charity and mercy from the breasts of his followers and had everywhere aroused a fierce spirit of strife and bloodshed. It throve on paradoxes. This unnatural spirit could not survive a period of calm deliberation; a leader was sure to rise from the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> ranks who should point out the baneful corollaries of the Genevan creed, and be listened to. Such a leader was Jacobus Arminius (Jakob Hermanzoon), professor at the University of Leyden. He was born at Oudewater, South <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, in 1560. While still an infant he lost his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, a cutler by trade, but through the generosity of strangers he was enabled to perfect his <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> at various <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> at home and in foreign parts. In his twenty-second year the brilliant youth, whose talents were universally acknowledged, was sent to Geneva at the expense of the merchants' guild of <a href="01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, in order to imbibe genuine <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> at the feet of Beza. In 1586 he made a prolonged trip to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which served to widen his <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> horizon. Rumours beginning to spread that he had fallen under the influence of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Francisco Su&aacute;rez and Bellarmin, he was recalled to <a href="01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, was pronounced <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, and appointed preacher of the reformed congregation. This office he filled with ever increasing renown for fifteen years. He had all the qualifications of a great <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator &#151; a sonorous voice, a magnificent presence, and a thorough <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Scripture, which he expounded in a clear and pleasing manner, dwelling with predilection on its <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> features and avoiding the polemical asperities characteristic of his age and <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. Yet his later years were fated to be embittered by polemical strife. The revolt against <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a> absolute was taking shape. A professor at Leyden had already pronounced <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> "a tyrant and an executioner". The learned <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> Koornhert, in spite of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures, continued to inveigh successfully against the dominant religion of <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>; and he had converted two <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of Delft who had been chosen to argue him into submission, from the supralapsarian to the <a href="08007a.htm">infralapsarian</a> position (<em>see</em> <a href="03198a.htm">CALVINISM</a>). The task of confounding the "heretic" was now entrusted to the disciple of Beza. Arminius addressed himself to the work; but he soon began to feel that <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> was repugnant to all the <a href="08050b.htm">instincts</a> of his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. More and more clearly, as time went on, his writings and sermons taught the doctrines since associated with his name and after his death embodied by his disciples in the famous five propositions of the "Remonstrants". For the sake of reference we give the substance of the "Remonstrantie" as condensed by Professor Blok in his "History of the People of the Netherlands" (III, ch. xiv).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>"They (the Remonstrants) declared themselves opposed to the following doctrines: (1) Predestination in its defined form; as if <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by an eternal and irrevocable decision had destined <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>, some to <a href="07170a.htm">eternal bliss</a>, others to <a href="07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>, without any other law than His own pleasure. On the contrary, they thought that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by the same resolution wished to make all believers in Christ who persisted in their <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> to the end blessed in Christ, and for His sake would only condemn the unconverted and unbelieving. (2) The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of election according to which the chosen were counted as necessarily and unavoidably blessed and the outcasts necessarily and unavoidably lost. They urged the milder <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> had died for all men, and that believers were only chosen in so far as they enjoyed the forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>. (3) The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for the <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> alone to make them blessed and no one else, <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> as mediator; on the contrary, they urged the possibility of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> for others not elect. (4) The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the <a href="06689a.htm">grace of God</a> affects the <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> only, while the reprobates cannot participate in this through their conversion, but only through their own strength. On the other hand, they, the 'Remonstrants', a name they received later from this, their 'Remonstrance', hold that man 'has no saving <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in himself, nor out of the force of his <a href="06259a.htm">free-will</a>', if he lives in <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that 'he be born again from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in Christ by means of His Holy Spirit, and renewed in understanding and affection, or will and all strength', since without grace man cannot resist <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, although he cannot be counted as irresistible to grace. (5) The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that he who had once attained <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> saving grace can never lose it and be wholly debased. They held, on the contrary, that whoever had received <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> quickening spirit had thereby a strong weapon against <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a>, <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, the world, and his own flesh, although they would not decide at the time without further investigation &#151; later they adopted this too &#151; whether he could not lose this power 'forsaking the beginning of his being, Christ.'"</p>

<p>The ultra-Calvinists responded by drafting a "Contra-Remonstrantie" in the following seven articles: (1) <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> had, after Adam's fall, reserved a certain number of <a href="09580c.htm">human beings</a> from destruction, and, in His eternal and unchangeable counsel, destined them to <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> through Christ, leaving the others alone in accordance with His righteous judgement. (2) The <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> are not only the good <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> who are adult, but also the "children of the covenant as long as they do not prove the contrary by their action". (3) In this election <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> does not consider <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> or conversion, but acts simply according to His pleasure. (4) <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son, <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a>, and of them alone. (5) The Holy Ghost in the Scriptures and in preaching speaks to them alone, to instruct and to convert them. (6) The <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> can never lose the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>, but they obtain power of resistance through the Holy Ghost active in them. (7) This would not lead them to follow the dictates of the flesh carelessly, but, on the contrary, they would go <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> way, considering that thereby alone could they be saved.</p>

<p>The defection of the popular and gifted divine was a severe blow to the rigid <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> and started a quarrel which eventually threatened the existence of the United <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. His reputation was greatly enhanced by his heroic fidelity to pastoral <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> during the plague of 1602, and the following year, through the influence of admirers like Grotius, he was, notwithstanding fierce opposition, appointed professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the University of Leyden. His life as professor was an unintermittent quarrel with his stern <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> colleague, Francis Gomarus, which divided the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> and the country into two hostile camps. Arminius did not live to see the ultimate results of the controversy, as he died of consumption in his forty-ninth Year, October, 1609. Although the principles of Arminius were solemnly condemned in the great <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> Synod held at Dordrecht, or Dort, in 1618-19, and the "Remonstrant <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>" was rigorously suppressed during the lifetime of Maurice of Orange, nevertheless the Leyden professor had given to ultra-Calvinism a blow from which it never recovered. The controversy was soon transplanted to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> where it roused the same dissensions as in <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>. In the following century it divided the early <a href="10237b.htm">Methodists</a> into two parties, the followers of John Wesley adhering to the Arminian view, those of George Whitefield professing the strict <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> tenets.</p>
