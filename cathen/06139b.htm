<p>(891-896)</p>

<p>The pontificate of this <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> belongs to that era of strife for political supremacy in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which succeeded the disruption of the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> empire. Formosus was probably a native of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and must have been born about 816, since, at his death, he is characterized by Vulgarius as an old man of eighty. The earliest historical information we possess concerning him is his <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> by <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> as <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Porto in 864. <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas</a> must have reposed great confidence in the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and ability of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, since, when the <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> prince Bogoris dispatched an embassy to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 866 to submit a series of questions for <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> decision, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Formosus and Bishop Paulus of Populonia as his <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> to <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. Formosus found such favour at the <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> court that Bogoris petitioned <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas</a> in 867 to appoint none other than him <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. To this proposal, however, <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas</a> did not accede, since the canons forbade a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to leave his own see to undertake the government of another diocese, and Formosus returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Bogoris afterwards renewed his petition to <a href="01156a.htm">Hadrian II</a> (867-872), the successor of <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas</a>, but with no more favourable result. In 869, <a href="01156a.htm">Hadrian</a> sent Formosus with another <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to assist the local <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in allaying the domestic strife between King Lothair and his wife Theutberga. Although the death of Lothair on his return from <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> (8 Aug., 869) left the mission without an object, it gave rise to fresh complications among the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> rulers, and Formosus was sent with Bishop Gauderich of <a href="11346a.htm">Velletri</a> to <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a> in 872, where Empress Engelberga and Louis the German were discussing the question of succession, Louis II having no male heir. At first <a href="08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a> (872-882) reposed trust in Formosus, and, on the death of Louis II (875), employed him with two other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to convey his invitation to Charles the Bald, King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, to come to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and receive the imperial crown from the hands of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Charles obeyed the call, was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor on <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 875, and before returning home, appointed Dukes Lambert and Guido of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> to assist the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> against the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. In 871, these nobles had been deprived of their dignities for conspiring against Louis II; but they were restored by Charles.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> entourage there were many who viewed with disapproval the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Charles, and favoured the <a href="15617c.htm">widowed</a> Empress Engelberga and Louis the German. Fearing severe chastisement, these political opponents of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> secretly to seek safety elsewhere. Cardinal Formosus was among the fugitives, as he dreaded the <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> without knowing exactly whereby he had incurred the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> resentment. From the fact that Formosus had been sent by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as ambassador to Charles and now directed his flight to Abbot Hugo at <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a> in Western <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, it must be inferred that he was not fundamentally opposed to the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Charles. He cannot, however, have been in sympathy with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> political views, and consequently feared lest he might share the fate of John's opponents at the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> court. As early as 872 he had been a candidate for the <a href="07424b.htm">papal see</a>, so that John possibly viewed him in the light of an opponent. On the flight of Formosus and the other <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> officials, John convened a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a>, 19 April, which ordered the fugitives to return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As they refused to obey this injunction, they were condemned by a second synod on 30 June. Against Formosus, should he fail to return, sentence of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and deposition were pronounced by the first synod, the charges being that, impelled by <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a>, he had aspired to the Archbishopric of <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> and the Chair of Peter, had opposed the emperor and had deserted his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> without <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> permission. It follows from this that John saw in Formosus a rival whom he gravely suspected. The second synod of 30 June, after several new accusations had been brought against Formosus (e.g. that he had despoiled the <a href="04060a.htm">cloisters</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had performed the divine service in spite of the <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>, had conspired with certain iniquitous men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> for the destruction of the <a href="07424b.htm">papal see</a>), excluded him from the ranks of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Such charges, made against a man who was religious, moral, ascetic, and <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> can only be referred to party spirit.</p>

<p>The condemnation of Formosus and the others was announced to the emperor and the Synod of Ponthion in July. In 878 John himself came to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and the deposition of Formosus, who appeared in person, was confirmed at the synod of <a href="15067a.htm">Troyes</a>. According to the acts of the synod, which are however of <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity, the sentence of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against Formosus was withdrawn, after he had promised on <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> never to return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> or exercise his <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions. The succeeding years were spent by Formosus at <a href="13716a.htm">Sens</a>. John's successor Marinus (882-884) released Formosus from his <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>, recalled him to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in 883 restored him to his Diocese of Porto. During the short pontificates of Marinus and his successor <a href="01156b.htm">Hadrian III</a> (884-885), and under <a href="14289c.htm">Stephen V</a> (885-891), we learn nothing important concerning Formosus. In September, 891, he was elected to succeed Stephen. Under <a href="14289c.htm">Stephen V</a> the political horizon had become very threatening. Charles the Fat had reunited the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom in 885, but after his deposition and death in 887, Arnulf of Carinthia, the natural son of Karlmann and the nominee of the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>, was unable to preserve its unity. In the western kingdom, Count Eudes of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Came forward as king; in Provence (Arelate), Louis, son of Boso; in North <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> (Jura), Rudolf, son of the Count of Auxerre and grandson of Louis the Pious; in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Berengar of Friaul. The last-mentioned was opposed and defeated by Duke Guido (Wido) of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, who thereupon took possession of <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, and assumed the title of king. Ruling now over the greater portion of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Guido was a very dangerous neighbour for the <a href="14257a.htm">papal states</a>, especially as the Archdukes of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> had been on many occasions engaged in conflict with the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. <a href="14289c.htm">Stephen V</a> had unwillingly <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> Guido emperor, as King Arnulf had been unable to accept the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> invitation to come to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Consequently Formosus, after he had been unanimously elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, found himself compelled to recognize Guido's dignity and to crown him and his son Lambert Roman Emperor on April, 892. Important <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions claimed the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> attention immediately after his elevation. In Constantinople, the patriarch Photius had been ejected and Stephen, the son of Emperor Basilius, elevated to the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. Archbishop Stylian of Neo-C&aelig;sarea and the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> opponents of Photius had written to <a href="14289c.htm">Stephen V</a>, requesting <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> and confirmation for those <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> who had recognized Photius only under compulsion and had received orders at his hands. In his reply to this petition (892) Formosus insisted on a distinction of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>; indulgence might be readily shown in the case of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, but in the case of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> such a course was attended with difficulties; the rule must be the sentence of the <a href="04310b.htm">Eighth General Council</a> (Can. iv), viz, that Photius neither had been nor was a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and all <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> or appointed by him must resign their office; the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, Landulf and Romanus, were to consult with Stylian and Theophylactus of <a href="01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> on the matter. In this instance, Formosus only corroborated the decisions of his predecessors, <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> and <a href="01156a.htm">Hadrian II</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>A matter of a pressing character, affecting the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, next called for the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> decision. A quarrel had broken out between Archbishop Hermann of Cologne and Archbishop Adalgar of <a href="07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> concerning the Bishopric of <a href="02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, which Hermann claimed as suffragan. Formosus decided, in accordance with the decrees of the Synod of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> (892), that <a href="02756a.htm">Bremen</a> should remain under the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> until new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were erected; Adalgar was to repair to the provincial synod of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. Formosus viewed with sorrow the political troubles that disturbed the old <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom of the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> dynasty. In the contest between Udes (Odo) of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Charles the Simple for the French crown, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, influenced by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, sided with Charles and called on Arnold, the German king, to support him. The political position in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> directly affected the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as head of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> estates, and consequently his independence as head of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Emperor Guido of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, the oppressor of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> territories, was too near <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and the position of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> seemed very similar to its condition in the time of the Lombard kingdom, when <a href="14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> summoned Pepin to his assistance. Formosus secretly persuaded Arnulf to advance to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and liberate <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; and, in 894, Arnulf made his first expedition, subjugating all the country north of the Po. Guido died in December of the same year, leaving his son Lambert, whom Formosus had <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor, in the Care of his mother Agiltrude, the implacable opponent of the Carlovingians. In the autumn of 895 Arnulf undertook his second Italian campaign, and in February, 896, stood before the walls of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Agiltrude had fortified herself in the city, but Arnulf succeeded in entering and was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The new emperor thence marched against <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> to besiege Lambert and his mother, but was struck with paralysis on the way and was unable to continue the campaign. Shortly afterwards (4 April, 896) Formosus died. He was succeeded by <a href="02661b.htm">Boniface VI</a>, who reigned only fifteen days.</p>

<p>Under Stephen VI, the successor of <a href="02661b.htm">Boniface</a>, Emperor Lambert and Agiltrude recovered their authority in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the beginning of 897, having renounced their claims to the greater part of Upper and Central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Agiltrude being determined to wreak vengeance on her opponent even after his death, Stephen VI lent himself to the revolting scene of sitting in judgment on his predecessor, Formosus. At the synod convened for that purpose, he occupied the chair; the corpse, clad in <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> vestments, was withdrawn from the sarcophagus and seated on a throne; close by stood a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> to answer in its name, all the old charges formulated against Formosus under <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a> being revived. The decision was that the deceased had been unworthy of the pontificate, which he could not have validly received since he was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of another see. All his measures and acts were annulled, and all the orders conferred by him were declared invalid. The <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> vestments were torn from his body; the three fingers which the dead <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had used in <a href="04276a.htm">consecrations</a> were severed from his right hand; the corpse was cast into a grave in the cemetery for strangers, to be removed after a few days and consigned to the Tiber. In 897 the second successor of Stephen had the body, which a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> had drawn from the Tiber, reinterred with full honours in <a href="13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. He furthermore annulled at a synod the decisions of the court of Stephen VI, and declared all orders conferred by Formosus valid. <a href="08425a.htm">John IX</a> confirmed these acts at two <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, of which the first was held at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the other at <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (898). On the other hand <a href="13729a.htm">Sergius III</a> (904-911) approved in a Roman synod the decisions of Stephen's synod against Formosus; all who had received orders from the latter were to be treated as <a href="08748a.htm">lay persons</a>, unless they sought reordination. <a href="13729a.htm">Sergius</a> and his party meted out severe treatment to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Formosus, who in turn had meanwhile conferred orders on many other <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, a policy which gave rise to the greatest confusion. Against these decisions many books were written, which demonstrated the validity of the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Formosus and of the orders conferred by him (see <a href="02147a.htm">AUXILIUS</a>).</p>
