<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The word <em>Father</em> is used in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> to mean a teacher of spiritual things, by whose means the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> is born again into the likeness of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>: "For if you have ten thousand instructors in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet not many fathers. For in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, by the <a href="06655b.htm">gospel</a>, I have begotten you. Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me, as I also am of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs15">1 Corinthians 4:15, 16</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs19">Galatians 4:19</a>). The first teachers of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> seem to be collectively spoken of as "the Fathers" (<a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs4">2 Peter 3:4</a>).</p>

<p>Thus <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> defines that a teacher is a father, and a <a href="05029a.htm">disciple</a> is a son (iv, 41,2), and so says <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.1.1</a>). A <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is emphatically a "father in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>", both because it was he, in early times, who <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> all his flock, and because he is the chief teacher of his church. But he is also regarded by the early Fathers, such as Hegesippus, <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, and <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> as the recipient of the tradition of his predecessors in the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, and consequently as the <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> and representative of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of his <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> before <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> and the world. Hence the expression "the Fathers" comes naturally to be applied to the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a preceding age, whether of the last generation or further back, since they are the <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> at whose knee the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of today was taught her <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>. It is also applicable in an eminent way to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> sitting in council, "the Fathers of Nicaea", "the Fathers of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a>". Thus Fathers have learnt from Fathers, and in the last resort from the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, who are sometimes called Fathers in this sense: "They are your Fathers", says <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>, of the Princes of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, speaking to the Romans; <a href="07349a.htm">St. Hilary of Arles</a> calls them <em>sancti patres</em>; <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> says that his teachers, from <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a>, Ionia, Coele-Syria, <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the Orient, <a href="02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, Palestine, respectively, had handed on to him the tradition of <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a> teaching from Peter, and James, and John, and Paul, receiving it "as son from father".</p>

<p>It follows that, as our own Fathers are the predecessors who have taught us, so the Fathers of the whole <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> are especially the earlier teachers, who instructed her in the teaching of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, during her infancy and first growth. It is difficult to define the first age of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, or the age of the Fathers. It is a common habit to stop the study of the early <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> in 451. "The Fathers" must undoubtedly include, in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (d. 604), and in the East, <a href="08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (d. about 754). It is frequently said that <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> (d. 1153) was the last of the Fathers, and <a href="10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Patrologia Latina" extends to <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, halting only on the verge of the thirteenth century, while his "Patrologia Graeca" goes as far as the <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (1438-9). These limits are evidently too wide, It will be best to consider that the great merit of St. Bernard as a writer lies in his resemblance in style and matter to the greatest among the Fathers, in spite of the difference of period. <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> (d. 636) and the <a href="02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (d. 735) are to be classed among the Fathers, but they may be said to have been born out of due <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, as St. Theodore the Studite was in the East.</p>

<h2 id="appeal">The appeal to the fathers</h2>

<p>Thus the use of the term <em>Fathers</em> has been continuous, yet it could not at first he employed in precisely the modern sense of Fathers of the Church. In early days the expression referred to writers who were then quite recent. It is still applied to those writers who are to us the ancients, but no longer in the same way to writers who are now recent. Appeals to the Fathers are a subdivision of appeals to tradition. In the first half of the second century begin the appeals to the sub-Apostolic age: Papias appeals to the <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and through them to the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Half a century later <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> supplements this method by an appeal to the tradition handed down in every <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by the succession of its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103301.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.1-3</a>), and <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> clinches this argument by the observation that as all the <a href="03744a.htm">Churches</a> agree, their tradition is secure, for they could not all have strayed by chance into the same <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> (Praescr., xxviii). The appeal is thus to <a href="03744a.htm">Churches</a> and their <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, none but <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> being the authoritative exponents of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of their <a href="03744a.htm">Churches</a>. As late as 341 the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Dedication Council at Antioch declared: "We are not followers of <a href="01718a.htm">Arius</a>; for how could we, who are <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, be <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a> of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>?"</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Yet slowly, as the appeals to the <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a> died out, there was arising by the side of appeals to the <a href="03744a.htm">Churches</a> a third method: the <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> of appealing to <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers who were not necessarily <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. While, without the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were substituted for churches, within the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were growing up. <a href="12025c.htm">Philosophers</a> like <a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a> and most of the numerous second-century <a href="01618a.htm">apologists</a> were reasoning about religion, and the great <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of Alexandria was gathering renown. Great <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> like <a href="05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, <a href="07015a.htm">Gregory Thaumaturgus of Pontus</a>, <a href="06080b.htm">Firmilian of Cappadocia</a>, and <a href="01295b.htm">Alexander of Jerusalem</a> were proud to be <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> called daily for the works of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> with the words "Give me the master". The <a href="02035a.htm">Patriarch Athanasius</a> refers for the ancient use of the word <em><a href="07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em>, not merely to the two Dionysii, but to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Theognostus. Yet these priest-teachers are not yet called Fathers, and the greatest among them, <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, Clement, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, Lucian, happen to be tinged with <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>; two became <a href="01582a.htm">antipopes</a>; one is the father of <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>; another was condemned by a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>. In each case we might apply the words used by St. Hilary of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>: "Sequenti errore detraxit scriptis probabilibus auctoritatem" (Comm. in Matt., v, 1, cited by <a href="15439b.htm">Vincent of L&eacute;rins</a>, 2.4).</p>

<p>A fourth form of appeal was better founded and of enduring value. Eventually it appeared that <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> as well as <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were fallible. In the second century the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. In the third they were often found wanting. In the fourth they were the leaders of <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a>, and <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, in the Meletian and <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> troubles and in the long <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> struggle, in which few were found to stand firm against the insidious <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="16027c.htm">Constantius</a>. It came to be seen that the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> Fathers of the Church are those <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers who have persevered in her communion, and whose teaching has been recognized as <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. So it came to pass that out of the four "Latin Doctors" one is not a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Two other Fathers who were not <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been declared to be <a href="05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a>, <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a> and <a href="08459b.htm">John Damascene</a>, while among the Doctors outside the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> period we find two more <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, the incomparable St. Bernard and the greatest of all <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. Nay, few writers had such great authority in the Schools of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> as the <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> <a href="02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, many of whose definitions are still commonplaces of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly (we may notice in passing) the name "Father", which originally belonged to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, has been as it were <a href="04696b.htm">delegated</a> to <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, especially as <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. It is now a form of address to all <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and, of recent years, in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>.</p>

<p><em>Papas</em> or <em>Pappas</em>, Pope, was a term of respect for eminent <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (e.g. in letters to <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> and to <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> &#151; neither of these writers seems to use it in addressing other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, except when <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> writes to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>). Eventually the term was reserved to the <a href="12260a.htm">bishops of Rome</a> and Alexandria; yet in the East today every <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is a "pope". The Aramaic <em>abbe</em> was used from early times for the superiors of <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a>. But through the abuse of granting <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> <em><a href="07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> to seculars, it has become a polite title for all <a href="13675a.htm">secular clerics</a>, even seminarists in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and especially in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, whereas all religious who are <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are addressed as "Father".</p>

<p>We receive only, says <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, what we have been taught by the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers; and he adds that in his <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Caesarea the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers of Nicaea has long been implanted (Ep. cxl, 2). <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> declares that he holds fast the teaching which he heard from the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="11264c.htm">Oracles</a>, and was taught by the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. These Cappadocian <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> seem to be the first to appeal to a real catena of Fathers. The appeal to one or two was already common enough; but not even the learned <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> had thought of a long string of authorities. St. Basil, for example (De Spir. S., ii, 29), cites for the formula "with the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" in the <a href="05150a.htm">doxology</a>, the example of <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, Clement and <a href="05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, <a href="05009b.htm">Dionysius of Rome</a>, <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Africanus, the <em>preces lucerariae</em> said at the lighting of <a href="08770a.htm">lamps</a>, <a href="02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, <a href="07015a.htm">Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, <a href="06080b.htm">Firmilian</a>, Meletius.</p>

<p>In the fifth century this method became a stereotyped <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a>. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> is perhaps the first writer to try to establish his interpretation of a text by a string of <a href="05692b.htm">exegetes</a> (Ep. cxii, ad Aug.). Paulinus, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> and biographer of <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, in the libellus he presented against the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> to <a href="15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> in 417, quotes <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, and the <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> of the late <a href="08011a.htm">Pope Innocent</a>. In 420 <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> quotes <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> and <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> against the same <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> (C. duas Epp. Pel., iv). <a href="08557b.htm">Julian of Eclanum</a> quoted <a href="08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> and <a href="02330b.htm">Basil</a>; <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> replies to him in 421 (Contra Julianum, i) with <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, Reticius, Olympius, Hilary, <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, the <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> of <a href="01199a.htm">African councils</a>, and above all <a href="12260a.htm">Popes</a> <a href="08011a.htm">Innocent</a> and <a href="15764c.htm">Zosimus</a>. In a celebrated passage he argues that these <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> writers are more than sufficient, but as Julian had <a href="01652a.htm">appealed</a> to the East, to the East, he shall go, and the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> adds <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, <a href="02330b.htm">Basil</a>, Synod of Diospolis, <a href="08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>. To these he adds <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a> (c. xxxiv): "Nor should you think <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, because he was a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, is to be despised", and adds a eulogy. This is amusing, when we remember that <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in a fit of irritation, fifteen before, had written to <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a> (Ep. cxlii) "Do not excite against me the silly crowd of the <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, who venerate you as a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and receive you with the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> due to a <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> when you declaim in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereas they think little of me, an old man, nearly decrepit, in my <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the solitude of the country."</p>

<p>In the second book "Contra Julianum", <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> again cites <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> frequently, and <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, Hilary, Chrysostom; in ii, 37, he recapitulates the nine names (omitting councils and <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>), adding (iii, 32) <a href="08011a.htm">Innocent</a> and Jerome. A few years later the <a href="13703a.htm">Semipelagians</a> of Southern Gaul, who were led by <a href="07349a.htm">St. Hilary of Arles</a>, <a href="15439b.htm">St. Vincent of L&eacute;rins</a>, and Bl. Cassian, refuse to accept <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> severe view of <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a> because "contrarium putant patrum opinioni et ecclesiastico sensui". Their opponent St. Prosper, who was trying to <a href="04347a.htm">convert</a> them to <a href="02091a.htm">Augustinianism</a>, complains: "Obstinationem suam vetustate defendunt" (Ep. inter Atig. ccxxv, 2), and they said that no <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer had ever before interpreted <a href="../bible/rom000.htm">Romans</a> quite as <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> did &#151; which was probably <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> enough. The interest of this attitude lies in the fact that it was, if not new at least more definite than any earlier appeal to antiquity. Through most of the fourth century, the controversy with the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a> had turned upon <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, and appeals to past authority were few. But the appeal to the Fathers was never the most imposing <em><a href="09320a.htm">locus theologicus</a></em>, for they could not easily be assembled so as to form an absolutely conclusive test. On the other hand up to the end of the fourth century, there were practically no <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> definitions available, except condemnations of <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, chiefly by <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. By the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> that the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> reaction under <a href="15253b.htm">Valens</a> <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> the Eastern conservatives to draw towards the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, and prepared the restoration of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> to power by <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, the Nicene decisions were beginning to be looked upon as sacrosanct, and that council to be preferred to a unique position above all others. By 430, the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> we have reached, the <a href="04478a.htm">Creed</a> we now say at Mass was revered in the East, whether rightly or wrongly, as the work of the 150 Fathers of Constantinople in 381, and there were also new <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> decisions, especially the <em>tractoria</em> of <a href="15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a>, which in 418 had been sent to all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the world to be signed.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It is to living authority, the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of which had thus come to the fore, that St. Prosper was appealing in his controversy with the Lerinese school. When he went to <a href="06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, in 431, as <a href="09118a.htm">papal envoy</a>, just after St. Augustine's death, he replied to their difficulties, not by reiterating that saint's hardest arguments, but by taking with him a letter from <a href="03477c.htm">Pope St. Celestine</a>, in which <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> is extolled as having been held by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> predecessors to be "inter magistros optimos". No one is to be allowed to depreciate him, but it is not said that every word of his is to be followed. The disturbers had appealed to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and the reply is "Desinat incessere novitas vetustatem" (Let novelty cease to attack antiquity!). An appendix is added, not of the opinions of ancient Fathers, but of recent <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, since the very same <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who thought <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> went too far, professed (says the appendix) "that they followed and approved only what the <a href="07424b.htm">most holy See</a> of the <a href="11744a.htm">Blessed Apostle Peter</a> sanctioned and taught by the ministry of its <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>". A list therefore follows of "the judgments of the rulers of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>", to which are added some sentences of <a href="01199a.htm">African councils</a>, "which indeed the <a href="01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> made their own when they approved them". To these <em>inviolabiles sanctiones</em> (we might roughly render "infallible utterances") <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> used in the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are appended "ut legem credendi lex statuat supplicandi" &#151; a frequently misquoted phrase &#151; and in conclusion, it is declared that these testimonies of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> are sufficient, "so that we consider not to be <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> at all whatever shall appear to be contrary to the decisions we have cited". Thus the decisions of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> are put on a very different level from the views of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, just as that saint always drew a sharp distinction between the resolutions of <a href="01199a.htm">African councils</a> or the extracts from the Fathers, on the one hand, and the <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> of <a href="12260a.htm">Popes</a> <a href="08011a.htm">Innocent</a> and Zosimus on the other.</p>

<p>Three years later a famous document on tradition and its use emanated from the Lerinese school, the "Commonitorium" of St. Vincent. He whole-heartedly accepted the letter of Pope Celestine, and he quoted it as an authoritative and irresistible <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> to his own <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that where <em>quod ubique</em>, or <em>universitas</em>, is uncertain, we must turn to <em>quod semper</em>, or <em>antiquitas</em>. Nothing could be more to his purpose than the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a>: "Desinat incessere novitas vetustatem." The &OElig;cumenical Council of Ephesus had been held in the same year that Celestine wrote. Its Acts were before St. Vincent, and it is clear that he looked upon both <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and council as decisive authorities. It was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to establish this, before turning to his famous canon, <em>quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus</em> otherwise <em>universitas, antiquitas, consensio</em>. It was not a new criterion, else it would have committed suicide by its very expression. But never had the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> been so admirably phrased, so limpidly explained, so adequately exemplified. Even the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the evolution of <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> is defined by Vincent in language which can hardly be surpassed for exactness and vigour. St. Vincent's triple test is wholly misunderstood if it is taken to be the ordinary <a href="05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. Like all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> he took the ordinary rule to be the <a href="15006b.htm">living magisterium</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and he assumes that the formal decision in cases of <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> lies with the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, or with a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>. But cases of <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> arise when no such decision is forthcoming. Then it is that the three tests are to be applied, not simultaneously, but, if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in succession.</p>

<p>When an <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> is found in one corner of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, then the first test, <em>universitas, quod ubique</em>, is an unanswerable refutation, nor is there any need to examine further (iii, 7, 8). But if an <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> attacks the whole <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, then <em>antiquitas, quod semper</em> is to be appealed to, that is, a consensus existing before the <a href="05525a.htm">novelty</a> arose. Still, in the previous period one or two teachers, even men of great fame, may have <a href="05525a.htm">erred</a>. Then we betake ourselves to <em>quod ab omnibus, consensio</em>, to the many against the few (if possible to a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>; if not, to an examination of writings). Those few are a trial of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> "ut tentet vos Dominus Deus vester" (<a href="../bible/deu013.htm#vrs1">Deuteronomy 13:1 sqq.</a>). So <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> was a <em>magna tentatio</em>; so was <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> &#151; indeed the greatest <a href="14504a.htm">temptation</a> of all. We must <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that whenever what is new or unheard before is introduced by one man beyond or against all the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, it pertains not to religion but to <a href="14504a.htm">temptation</a> (xx, 49).</p>

<p>Who are the "Saints" to whom we appeal? The reply is a definition of "Fathers of the Church" given with all St. Vincent's inimitable accuracy: "Inter se majorem consulat interrogetque sententias, <em>eorum dumtaxat qui, diversis licet temporibus et locis, in unius tamen ecclesiae Catholicae communione et fide permanentes, magistri probabiles exstiterunt</em>; et quicquid non unus aut duo tantum, sed omnes pariter uno eodemque consensu aperte, frequenter, perseveranter tenuisse, scripsisse, docuisse cognoverit, id sibi quoque intelligat absque ulla dubitatione credendum" (iii, 8). This unambiguous sentence defines for us what is the right way of appealing to the Fathers, and the italicized words perfectly explain what is a "Father": "Those alone who, though in diverse times and places, yet persevering in <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, communion and <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="15179a.htm">one</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, have been approved teachers."</p>

<p>The same result is obtained by modern <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, in their definitions; e.g. <a href="06051a.htm">Fessler</a> thus defines what constitutes a "Father":</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li><a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and learning;</li><li><a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life;</li><li>(at the present day) a certain antiquity.</li></ol></div>

<p>The criteria by which we judge whether a writer is a "Father" or not are:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>citation by a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>, or</li><li>in public Acts of <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> addressed to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or concerning <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>;</li><li>encomium in the Roman <a href="09741a.htm">Martyrology</a> as "sanctitate et doctrina insignis";</li><li>public reading in Churches in early centuries;</li><li>citations, with praise, as an authority as to the <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> by some of the more celebrated Fathers.</li></ol></div>

<p>Early authors, though belonging to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, who fail to reach this standard are simply <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers ("Patrologia", ed. <a href="08566b.htm">Jungmann</a>, ch. i, #11). On the other hand, where the appeal is not to the authority of the writer, but his testimony is merely required to the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> of his time, one writer is as good as another, and if a Father is cited for this purpose, it is not as a Father that he is cited, but merely as a <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> to facts well known to him. For the history of <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, therefore, the works of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers who are not only not approved, but even <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a>, are often just as valuable as those of the Fathers. On the other hand, the <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> of one Father is occasionally of great weight for <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> when taken singly, if he is teaching a subject on which he is recognized by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as an especial authority, e.g., <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> on the Divinity of the Son, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> on the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, etc.</p>

<p>There are a few cases in which a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> has given approbation to the work of a Father, the most important being the two letters of <a href="04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> which were read at the Council of Ephesus. But the authority of single Fathers considered in itself, says <a href="06242a.htm">Franzelin</a> (De traditione, thesis xv), "is not <a href="07790a.htm">infallible</a> or peremptory; though <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and sound <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> agree that the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions of such <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> should not be treated lightly, and should not without great caution be interpreted in a sense which clashes with the common <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of other Fathers." The <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> is plain enough; they were <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> men, who are not to be presumed to have intended to stray from the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and their <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> utterances are therefore to be taken in the best sense of which they are capable. If they cannot be explained in an <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> sense, we have to admit that not the greatest is immune from <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or accidental <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> or obscurity. But on the use of the Fathers in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions, the article <a href="15006b.htm">T<font size=-2>RADITION</font></a> and the ordinary <a href="05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> treatises on that subject must be consulted, as it is proper here only to deal with the historical development of their use.</p>

<p>The subject was never treated as a part of <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> until the rise of what is now commonly called "Theologia fundamentalis", in the sixteenth century, the founders of which are <a href="03251a.htm">Melchior Canus</a> and <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>. The former has a discussion of the use of the Fathers in deciding questions of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (De locis theologicis, vii). The <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant Reformers</a> attacked the authority of the Fathers. The most famous of these opponents is Dalbeus (Jean Daill&eacute;, 1594-1670, "Trait&eacute; de l'emploi des saints P&egrave;res", 1632; in Latin "De usu Patrum", 1656). But their objections are long since forgotten.</p>

<p>Having traced the development of the use of the Fathers up to the period of its frequent employment, and of its formal statement by <a href="15439b.htm">St. Vincent of L&eacute;rins</a>, it will be well to give a glance at the continuation of the practice. We saw that, in 431, it was possible for St. Vincent (in a book which has been most unreasonably taken to be a mere polemic against <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> &#151; a notion which is amply refuted by the use made in it of St. Celestine's letter) to define the meaning and method of <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> appeals. From that <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> onward they are very common. In the Council of Ephesus, 431, as St. Vincent points out, St. Cyril presented a series of quotations from the Fathers, <em>t&ocirc;n hagi&ocirc;tat&ocirc;n kai hosi&ocirc;tat&ocirc;n pater&ocirc;n kai episkop&ocirc;n diaphor&ocirc;n martur&ocirc;n</em>, which were read on the motion of Flavian, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12007c.htm">Philippi</a>. They were from <a href="11771a.htm">Peter I of Alexandria</a>, <a href="09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="12260a.htm">Popes</a> Julius and Felix (forgeries), Theophilus, <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, Ambrose, <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, Basil, <a href="07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a>, <a href="02060d.htm">Atticus</a>, Amphilochius.</p>

<p>On the other hand <a href="05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, when tried at Constantinople by <a href="06098c.htm">St. Flavian</a>, in 449, refused to accept either Fathers or councils as authorities, confining himself to <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, a position which horrified his judges (see <a href="05631a.htm">E<font size=-2>UTYCHES</font></a>). In the following year <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> sent his <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a>, <a href="01075b.htm">Abundius</a> and <a href="02018a.htm">Asterius</a>, to Constantinople with a list of testimonies from Hilary, <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, Theophilus, <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, Basil, and <a href="04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>. They were signed in that city, but were not produced at the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> in the following year. Thenceforward the <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> is fixed, and it is unnecessary to give examples. However, that of the sixth council in 680 is important: <a href="01204c.htm">Pope St. Agatho</a> sent a long series of extracts from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the leader of the <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>, <a href="09483b.htm">Macarius of Antioch</a>, presented another. Both sets were carefully verified from the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarchate</a> of Constantinople, and <a href="13649a.htm">sealed</a>.</p>

<p>It should be noted that it was never in such cases thought <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to trace a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> back to the earliest times; St. Vincent demanded the <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> before a <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> arose &#151; this is his notion of <em>antiquitas</em>; and in conformity with this view, the Fathers quoted by councils and <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and Fathers are for the most part recent (<a href="11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, De Incarn., XIV, 15, 2-5).</p>

<p>In the last years of the fifth century a famous document, attributed to <a href="12260a.htm">Popes</a> <a href="06407a.htm">Gelasius</a> and <a href="07470a.htm">Hormisdas</a>, adds to <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> of <a href="04613a.htm">St. Damasus</a> of 382 a list of books which are approved, and another of those disapproved. In its present form the list of approved Fathers comprises <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, Basil, Athanasius, Chrysostom, Theophilus, Hilary, <a href="04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a> (wanting in one <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>), <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, <a href="12487a.htm">Prosper</a>, Leo ("every iota" of the tome to <a href="06098c.htm">Flavian</a> is to be accepted under <a href="01455e.htm">anathema</a>), and "also the treatises of all <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Fathers, who deviated in nothing from the fellowship of the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and were not separated from her <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and preaching, but were participators through the <a href="06689a.htm">grace of God</a> until the end of their life in her communion; also the <a href="04670b.htm">decretal letters</a>, which most <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a> <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> have given at various times when consulted by various Fathers, are to be received with veneration". Orosius, Sedulius, and <a href="08586b.htm">Juvencus</a> are praised.</p>

<p>Rufinus and <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> are rejected. <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius's</a> "History" and <a href="05616a.htm">"Chronicle"</a> are not to be condemned altogether, though in another part of the list they appear as "apocrypha" with <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="08736a.htm">Lactantius</a>, Africanus, Commodian, <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="01746c.htm">Arnobius</a>, Cassian, <a href="15414a.htm">Victorinus of Pettau</a>, Faustus, and the works of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and <a href="06135b.htm">forged</a> <a href="13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> documents.</p>

<p>The later Fathers constantly used the writings of the earlier. For instance, <a href="03135b.htm">St. Caesarius of Arles</a> drew freely on St. Augustine's <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>, and embodied them in collections of his own; <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> has largely founded himself on <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>; <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore</a> rests upon all his predecessors; <a href="08459b.htm">St. John Damascene's</a> great work is a synthesis of <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. <a href="02384a.htm">St. Bede's</a> <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> are a <em>cento</em> from the greater Fathers. Eugippius made a selection from St. Augustine's writings, which had an immense vogue. <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> made a collection of select commentaries by various writers on all the books of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. St. Benedict especially recommended <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> study, and his <a href="02443a.htm">sons</a> have observed his advice: "Ad perfectionem conversationis qui festinat, sunt doctrinae sanctorum Patrum, quarum observatio perducat hominem ad celsitudinem perfectionis . . . quis liber sanctorum catholicorum Patrum hoc non resonat, ut recto cursu perveniamus ad creatorem nostrum?" (Sanet Regula, lxxiii). <a href="06121a.htm">Florilegia</a> and <a href="03434a.htm">catenae</a> became common from the fifth century onwards. They are mostly anonymous, but those in the East which go under the name <a href="11214b.htm">&OElig;cumenius</a> are well known. Most famous of all throughout the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was the "Glossa ordinaria" attributed to <a href="15526a.htm">Walafrid</a> Strabo. The "Catena aurea" of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> is still in use. (See <a href="03434a.htm">C<font size=-2>ATENAE</font></a>, and the valuable matter collected by Turner in Hastings, Dict. of the Bible, V, 521.)</p>

<p><a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was early recognized as the first of the <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> Fathers, with <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> and <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> by his side. <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> was added, and these four became "the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> Doctors". <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>, in some ways the greatest of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, was excluded, both on account of the paucity of his writings, and by the fact that his letters had a far higher authority as <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> utterances.</p>

<p>In the East <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> has always been the most popular, as he is the most voluminous, of the Fathers. With the great St. Basil, the father of monachism, and <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, famous for the purity of his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, he made up the triumvirate called "the three <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchs</a>", familiar up to the present day in <a href="03095a.htm">Eastern art</a>. <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> was added to these by the <a href="09022a.htm">Westerns</a>, so that four might answer to four. (See <a href="05075a.htm">D<font size=-2>OCTORS OF THE</font> C<font size=-2>HURCH</font></a>.)</p>

<p>It will be observed that many of the writers rejected in the Gelasian list lived and died in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion, but incorrectness in some part of their writings, e.g. the <a href="13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a> <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> attributed to Cassian and Faustus, the <a href="10307a.htm">chiliasm</a> of the conclusion of Victorinus's commentary on the <a href="01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a> (St. Jerome issued an expurgated edition, the only one in print as yet), the unsoundness of the lost "Hypotyposes" of Clement, and so forth, prevented such writers from being spoken of, as Hilary was by Jerome, "inoffenso pede percurritur". As all the more important doctrines of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (except that of the Canon and the inspiration of Scripture) may be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>, or at least illustrated, from <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, the widest office of tradition is the interpretation of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, and the authority of the Fathers is here of very great importance. Nevertheless it is only then necessarily to be followed when all are of one <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>: "Nemo . . . contra unanimum consensum Patrum ipsam Scripturam sacram interpretari audeat", says the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; and the <a href="04478a.htm">Creed</a> of <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> has similarly: ". . . nec eam unquam nisi juxta unanimum consensum Patrum accipiam et interpretabor". The <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> echoes <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a>: "nemini licere . . . contra unanimum sensum Patrum ipsam Scripturam sacram interpretari."</p>

<p>A consensus of the Fathers is not, of course, to be expected in very small matters: "Quae tamen antiqua sanctorum patrum consensio non in omnibus divinae legis quaestiunculis, sed solum certe praecipue in fidei regula magno nobis studio et investiganda est et sequenda" (Vincent, xxviii, 72). This is not the method, adds St. Vincent, against widespread and inveterate <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, but rather against novelties, to be applied directly they appear. A better instance could hardly be given than the way in which <a href="01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a> was met by the <a href="06236a.htm">Council of Frankfort</a> in 794, nor could the principle be better expressed than by the Fathers of the <a href="06236a.htm">Council</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Tenete vos intra terminos Patrum, et nolite novas versare quaestiunculas; ad nihilum enim valent nisi ad subversionem audientium. Sufficit enim vobis sanctorum Patrum vestigia sequi, et illorum dicta firma tenere fide. Illi enim in Domino nostri exstiterunt doctores in fide et ductores ad vitam; quorum et sapientia Spiritu Dei plena libris legitur inscripta, et vita meritorum miraculis clara et sanctissima; quorum animae apud Deum Dei Filium, D.N.J.C. pro magno pietatis labore regnant in caelis. Hos ergo tota animi virtute, toto caritatis affectu sequimini, beatissimi fratres, ut horum inconcussa firmitate doctrinis adhaerentes, consortium aeternae beatitudinis . . . cum illis habere mereamini in caelis" ("Synodica ad Episc." in <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XIII, 897-8).</p></blockquote>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>And an excellent act of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in the tradition of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is that of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (ibid., 902) made on the same occasion:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Apostolicae sedi et antiquis ab initio nascentis ecclesiae et catholicis traditionibus tota mentis intentione, tota cordis alacritate, me conjungo. Quicquid in illorum legitur libris, qui divino Spiritu afflati, toti orbi a Deo Christo dati sunt doctores, indubitanter teneo; hoc ad salutem animae meae sufficere credens, quod sacratissimae evangelicae veritatis pandit historia, quod apostolica in suis epistolis confirmat auctoritas, quod eximii Sacrae Scripturae tractatores et praecipui Christianae fidei doctores ad perpetuam posteris scriptum reliquerunt memoriam."</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="classification">Classification of patristic writings</h2>

<p>In order to get a good view of the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> period, the Fathers may be divided in various ways. One favourite method is by periods; the Ante-Nicene Fathers till 325; the Great Fathers of the fourth century and half the fifth (325-451); and the later Fathers. A more obvious division is into Easterns and <a href="09022a.htm">Westerns</a>, and the Easterns will comprise writers in Greek, <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a>, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and Coptic. A convenient division into smaller groups will be by periods, nationalities and character of writings; for in the East and <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> there were many races, and some of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers are <a href="01618a.htm">apologists</a>, some preachers, some historians, some commentators, and so forth.</p>

<p><a href="06001a.htm#A">A.</a> After (1) the <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> come in the second century (2) the Greek apologists, followed by (3) the Western apologists somewhat later, (4) the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> and <a href="09645c.htm">Marcionite</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> with their <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal Scriptures</a>, and (5) the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> replies to them.</p>

<p><a href="06001a.htm#B">B.</a> The third century gives us (1) the Alexandrian writers of the <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> school, (2) the writers of <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and (3) Palestine, and the first Western writers, (4) at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Hippolytus (in Greek), and <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, (5) the great African writers, and a few others.</p>

<p><a href="06001a.htm#C">C.</a> The fourth century opens with (1) the apologetic and the historical works of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, with whom we may class <a href="04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> and St. Epiphanius, (2) the Alexandrian writers Athanasius, Didymus, and others, (3) the Cappadocians, (4) the Antiochenes, (5) the Syriac writers. In the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> we have (6) the opponents of <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, (7) the Italians, including Jerome, (8) the Africans, and (9) the Spanish and Gallic writers.</p>

<p><a href="06001a.htm#D">D.</a> The fifth century gives us (1) the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> controversy, (2) the <a href="05633a.htm">Eutychian</a> controversy, including the Western <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>; (3) the historians. In the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> (4) the school of L&eacute;rins, (5) the letters of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>.</p>

<p><a href="06001a.htm#E">E.</a> The sixth century and the seventh give us less important names and they must be grouped in a more mechanical way.</p>

<h3 id="A">A</h3>

<p>(1) If we now take these groups in detail we find the letters of the chief <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>, St. Clement, St. Ignatius, and <a href="12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, venerable not merely for their antiquity, but for a certain simplicity and nobility of thought and style which is very moving to the reader. Their quotations from the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are quite free. They offer most important information to the historian, though in somewhat homoeopathic quantities. To these we add the <a href="04779a.htm">Didache</a>, probably the earliest of all; the curious allegorizing anti-Jewish <a href="05509a.htm">epistle</a> which goes under the name of Barnabas; the Shepherd of Hermas, a rather dull series of <a href="15477a.htm">visions</a> chiefly connected with penance and pardon, composed by the brother of <a href="12126b.htm">Pope Pius I</a>, and long appended to the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> as of almost canonical importance. The works of Papias, the <a href="05029a.htm">disciple</a> of St. John and Aristion, are lost, all but a few precious fragments.</p>

<p>(2) The <a href="01618a.htm">apologists</a> are most of them <a href="12025c.htm">philosophic</a> in their treatment of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Some of their works were presented to emperors in order to disarm <a href="11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. We must not always accept the view given to outsiders by the <a href="01618a.htm">apologists</a>, as representing the whole of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> they <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> and practised. The apologies of <a href="12589b.htm">Quadratus</a> to <a href="07104b.htm">Hadrian</a>, of Aristo of Pella to the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, of Miltiades, of Apollinaris of Hierapolis, and of Melito of Sardis are lost to us. But we still possess several of greater importance. That of <a href="01712d.htm">Aristides of Athens</a> was presented to <a href="01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a>, and deals principally with the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="06608a.htm">true God</a>. The fine apology of <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> with its appendix is above all interesting for its description of the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgy</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> c. 150. His arguments against the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> are found in the well-composed "Dialogue with Trypho", where he speaks of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> authorship of the <a href="01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a> in a manner which is of first-rate importance in the mouth of a man who was <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> at Ephesus some <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> before the year 132. The "Apology" of <a href="08580c.htm">Justin's</a> <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="05029a.htm">disciple</a> <a href="14464b.htm">Tatian</a> is a less conciliatory work, and its author fell into <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. <a href="02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, an <a href="02043b.htm">Athenian</a> (c. 177), addressed to <a href="02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href="04166a.htm">Commodus</a> an eloquent refutation of the absurd <a href="03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Theophilus, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, about the same <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, wrote three books of apology addressed to a certain Autolycus.</p>

<p>(3) All these works are of considerable literary ability. This is not the case with the great Latin apology which closely follows them in <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, the "Apologeticus" of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, which is in the uncouth and untranslatable language affected by its author. Nevertheless it is a work of extraordinary genius, in interest and value far above all the rest, and for energy and boldness it is incomparable. His fierce "Ad Scapulam" is a warning addressed to a persecuting proconsul. "Adversus Judaeos" is a title which explains itself. The other Latin <a href="01618a.htm">apologists</a> are later. The "Octavios" of <a href="10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a> is as polished and gentle as <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> is rough. Its <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> is uncertain. If the "Apologeticus "was well calculated to infuse <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> into the <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, the "Octavius" was more likely to impress the inquiring <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a>, if so be that more flies are caught with honey than with vinegar. With these works we may mention the much later <a href="08736a.htm">Lactantius</a>, the most perfect of all in literary form ("Divinae Institutiones", c. 305-10, and "De Mortibus persecutorum", c. 314). Greek apologies probably later than the second century are the "Irrisiones" of Hermias, and the very beautiful <a href="05008b.htm">"Epistle" to Diognetus</a>.</p>

<p>(4) The <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> writings of the second century are mostly lost. The <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> had schools and philosophized; their writers were numerous. Some curious works have come down to us in Coptic. The letter of Ptolemeus to Flora in Epiphanius is almost the only Greek fragment of real importance. <a href="09645c.htm">Marcion</a> founded not a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> but a Church, and his <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, consisting of St. Luke and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, is preserved to some extent in the works written against him by <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and Epiphanius. Of the writings of Greek <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a> and of other early <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, almost nothing remains. The <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> composed a quantity of <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a> amid Acts of <a href="07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, large portions of which are preserved, mostly in fragments, in Latin revisions, or in <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a>, Coptic, Arabic, or <a href="14041b.htm">Slavonic</a> versions. To these are to be added such well-known forgeries as the letters of Paul to Seneca, and the Apocalypse of Peter, of which a fragment was recently found in the Fay&ucirc;m.</p>

<p>(5) Replies to the attacks of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> form, next to the <a href="01618a.htm">apologetic</a> against <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecutors</a> on the one hand and <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> on the other, the characteristic <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature of the second century. The "Syntagma" of <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> against all <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> is lost. Earlier yet, <a href="11457c.htm">St. Papias</a> (already mentioned) had directed his efforts to the refutation of the rising <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>, and the same preoccupation is seen in St. Ignatius and <a href="12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>. Hegesippus, a <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> of Palestine, journeyed to <a href="04363b.htm">Corinth</a> and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he stayed from the episcopate of <a href="01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> till that of Eleutherius (c. 160-180), with the <a href="08069b.htm">intention</a> of refuting the novelties of the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> and <a href="09645c.htm">Marcionites</a> by an appeal to tradition. His work is lost. But the great work of <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> (c. 180) against <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> is founded on Papias, Hegesippus, and <a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a>, and gives from careful investigation an account of many <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> systems, together with their refutation. His appeal is less to <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> than to the tradition which the whole <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has received and handed down from the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, through the ministry of successive <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and particularly to the tradition of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> founded by Peter and Paul.</p>

<p>By the side of <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> must be put the Latin <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, whose book "Of the Prescriptions Against Heretics" is not only a masterpiece of argument, but is almost as effective against modern <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> as against those of the early <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is a witness of extraordinary importance to the principles of unvarying tradition which the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has always professed, and to the primitive <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> that <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> must be interpreted by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and not by private industry. He uses <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> in this work, and his polemical books against the <a href="15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> and the <a href="09645c.htm">Marcionites</a> borrow freely from that saint. He is the less persuasive of the two, because he is too abrupt, too clever, too anxious for the slightest controversial advantage, without thought of the easy replies that might be made. He sometimes prefers wit or hard hitting to solid argument. At this period controversies were beginning within the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the most important being the question whether <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> could be celebrated on a weekday. Another burning question at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, at the turn of the century, was the <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the <a href="12473a.htm">prophesying</a> of the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a> could be approved, and yet another, in the first years of the third century, was the controversy with a group of opponents of <a href="10521a.htm">Montanism</a> (so it seems), who denied the <a href="02137a.htm">authenticity</a> of the writings of St. John, an <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> then quite new.</p>

<h3 id="B">B</h3>

<p>(1) The <a href="01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a> already in the second century showed the note of learning, together with a habit borrowed from the Alexandrian <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, especially <a href="12023a.htm">Philo</a>, of an allegorizing interpretation of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. The latter characteristic is already found in the "Epistle of Barnabas", which may be of Alexandrian origin. Pantamus was the first to make the Catechetical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the city famous. No writings of his are extant, but his pupil Clement, who taught in the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> with Pantamus, c. 180, and as its head, c. 180-202 (died c. 214), has left a considerable amount of rather lengthy disquisitions dealing with mythology, <a href="14621a.htm">mystical theology</a>, <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, social observances, and all other things in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth. He was followed by the great <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, whose fame spread far and wide even among the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a>. The remains of his works, though they fill several volumes, are to a great extent only in free Latin translations, and bear but a small ratio to the vast amount that has perished. The Alexandrians held as firmly as any <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to tradition as the <a href="05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, at least in theory, but beyond tradition they allowed themselves to speculate, so that the "Hypotyposes" of Clement have been almost entirely lost on account of the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> which found a place in them, and <a href="11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works fell under the ban of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, though their author lived the life of a <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, and died, shortly after the <a href="04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, of the sufferings he had undergone in it.</p>

<p>The <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> were many and eminent. The <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> founded by one of them, <a href="01295b.htm">St. Alexander of Jerusalem</a>, was precious later on to <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. The most celebrated of the school were <a href="05011a.htm">St. Dionysius "the Great"</a> of Alexandria and <a href="07015a.htm">St. Gregory of Neocaesarea</a> in <a href="12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, known as the Wonder-Worker, who, like St. Nonnosus in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, was said to have moved a mountain for short distance by his <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Of the writings of these two <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> not very much is extant.</p>

<p>(2) <a href="10521a.htm">Montanism</a> and the <a href="05228a.htm">paschal question</a> brought <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> down from the leading position it held in the second century into a very inferior rank in the third. Besides <a href="07015a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, St. Methodius at the end of that century was a polished writer and an opponent of <a href="11306b.htm">Origenism</a> &#151; his name is consequently passed over without mention by the <a href="11306b.htm">Origenist</a> historian <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. We have his "Banquet" in Greek, and some smaller works in <a href="14041b.htm">Old Slavonic</a>.</p>

<p>(3) Antioch was the head <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> over the "Orient" including <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Mesopotamia as well as Palestine and <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, but at no time did this form a compact <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> like that of Alexandria. We must group here writers who have no connection with one another in matter or style. <a href="08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a> lived at <a href="05405a.htm">Emmaus</a> and composed a chronography, out of which the episcopal lists of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Alexandria, and Antioch, and a great deal of other matter, have been preserved for us in <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> version of the <a href="05616a.htm">Chronicle of Eusebius</a>, and in Byzantine chronographers. Two letters of his are of interest, but the fragments of his "Kestoi" or "Girdles" are of no <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> value; they contain much curious matter and much that is objectionable. In the second half of the third century, perhaps towards the end of it, a great <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was established at Antioch by Lucian, who was <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> in 312. He is said to have been <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> under three <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but if this is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> he had been long restored at the time of his <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. It is quite uncertain whether he shared the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> (<a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="04737b.htm">deposed</a> for <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> in 268-9). At all events he was &#151; however unintentionally &#151; the father of <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and his pupils were the leaders of that <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>: <a href="05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, <a href="01718a.htm">Arius</a> himself, with Menophantus of Ephesus, Athanasius of Anazarbus, and the only two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who refused to sign the new <a href="04478a.htm">creed</a> at the <a href="11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, Theognis of Nicaea and Maris of Chalcedon, besides the <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> Leontius of Antioch and the <a href="14145c.htm">Sophist</a> <a href="02018a.htm">Asterius</a>. At Caesarea, an <a href="11306b.htm">Origenist</a> centre, flourished under another <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>, St. Pamphilus, who with his friend <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, a certain Ammonius, and others, collected the works of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> in a long-famous <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>, corrected <a href="11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <a href="07316a.htm">"Hexapla"</a>, and did much editing of the text both of the Old and the New Testaments.</p>

<p>(4) We hear of no writings at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> except in Greek, until the mention of some small works in Latin, by <a href="15408a.htm">Pope St. Victor</a>, which still existed in Jerome's day. <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, a Roman <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, wrote from c. 200 to 235, and always in Greek, though at Carthage <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> had been writing before this in Latin. If <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> is the author of the "Philosophumena" he was an <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, and full of unreasoning enmity to his rival St. Callistus; his <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> makes the Word proceed from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by His Will, distinct from Him in <a href="14322c.htm">substance</a>, and becoming Son by becoming <a href="09580c.htm">man</a>. There is nothing Roman in the <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of this work; it rather connects itself with the Greek <a href="01618a.htm">apologists</a>. A great part of a large commentary on <a href="04620a.htm">Daniel</a> and a work against Noetus are the only other important remains of this writer, who was soon forgotten in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, though fragments of his works turn up in all the Eastern languages. Parts of his chronography, perhaps his last work, have survived. Another Roman <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, wrote in ponderous and studied prose with metrical endings. Some of his works have come down to us under the name of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. Like <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, he made his rigorist views the pretext for his <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Unlike <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, he is quite <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> in his principal work, "De Trinitate".</p>

<p>(5) The <a href="01618a.htm">apologetic</a> works of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> have been mentioned. The earlier were written by him when a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Carthage, but about the year 200 he was led to <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanist</a> <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a> of Phrygia, and he headed a <a href="10521a.htm">Montanist</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> at Carthage. Many of his treatises are written to defend his position and his rigorist doctrines, and he does so with considerable <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> and with the clever and hasty argumentation which is natural to him. The placid flow of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> eloquence (<a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, 249-58) is a great contrast to that of his "master". The short treatises and large correspondence of this saint are all concerned with local questions and needs, and he eschews all speculative <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. From this we gain the more light on the state of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, on its government, and on a number of interesting <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and social matters. In all the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> period there is nothing, with the exception of Eusebius's history, which tells us so much about the early <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as the small volume which contains <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> works. At the end of the century <a href="01746c.htm">Arnobius</a>, like <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> a <a href="04347a.htm">convert</a> in middle age, and like other <a href="01181a.htm">Africans</a>, <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="08736a.htm">Lactantius</a>, and <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, a former rhetorician, composed a dull apology. <a href="08736a.htm">Lactantius</a> carries us into the fourth century. He was an elegant and eloquent writer, but like <a href="01746c.htm">Arnobius</a> was not a well-instructed <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>

<h3 id="C">C</h3>

<p>(1) The fourth century is the great age of the Fathers. It was twelve years old when Constantine published his edict of <a href="14761a.htm">toleration</a>, and a new era for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> began. It is ushered in by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, with his great <a href="01618a.htm">apologetic</a> works "Praeparatio Evangelica" and "Demonstratio Evangelica", which show the transcendent merit of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and his still greater historical works, the "Chronicle" (the Greek original is lost) and the "History", which has gathered up the fragments of the age of <a href="11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, and has preserved to us more than half of all we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> about the heroic ages of the <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. In <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> was a follower of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, but he rejected the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="04470a.htm">Creation</a> and of the <a href="09328a.htm">Logos</a>, so that he was able to regard the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a> with considerable cordiality. The original form of the pseudo-Clementine romance, with its long and tiresome dialogues, seems to be a work of the very beginning of the century against the new developments of <a href="11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, and it was written either on the <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> coast or not far inland in the <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a> neighbourhood. Replies to the greatest of the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> attacks, that of Porphyry, become more frequent after the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> revival under <a href="08558b.htm">Julian</a> (361-3), and they occupied the labours of many celebrated writers. <a href="04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> has left us a complete series of instructions to <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and the <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, thus supplying us with an exact <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the religious teaching imparted to the people in an important <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the East in the middle of the fourth century. A Palestinian of the second half of the century, <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13393a.htm">Salamis</a> in <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and wrote a learned history of all the <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>. He is unfortunately inaccurate, and has further made great difficulties for us by not naming his authorities. He was a friend of <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, and an uncompromising opponent of <a href="11306b.htm">Origenism</a>.</p>

<p>(2) The <a href="01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="01718a.htm">Arius</a> was not a product of the <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of that city, but of the Lucianic <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of Antioch. The Alexandrian tendency was quite opposite to the Antiochene, and the Alexandrian <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Alexander, condemned <a href="01718a.htm">Arius</a> in letters still extant, in which we gather the tradition of the <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandrian Church</a>. There is no trace in them of <a href="11306b.htm">Origenism</a>, the head-quarters of which had long been at <a href="03134b.htm">Caesarea in Palestine</a>, in the succession Theoctistus, <a href="11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a>, <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. The tradition of Alexandria was rather that which <a href="05011a.htm">Dionysius the Great</a> had received from <a href="05009b.htm">Pope Dionysius</a>. Three years after the Nicene Council (325), <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> began his long episcopate of forty-five years. His writings are not very voluminous, being either controversial <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> or <a href="01618a.htm">apologetic</a> memoirs of his own troubles, but their <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and historical value is enormous, on account of the leading part taken by this truly great man in the fifty years of fight with <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. The head of the <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> during this half-century was <a href="04784a.htm">Didymus the Blind</a>, an Athanasian in his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Son, and rather clearer even than his patriarch in his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity, but in many other points carrying on the <a href="11306b.htm">Origenistic</a> tradition. Here may be also mentioned by the way a rather later writer, <a href="14386a.htm">Synesius of Cyrene</a>, a man of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and literary habits, who showed energy and sincere <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> as a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in spite of the rather <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> character of his culture. His letters are of great interest.</p>

<p>(3) The second half of the century is illustrated by an illustrious triad in Cappadocia, St. Basil, his friend <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, and his brother <a href="07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>. They were the main workers in the return of the East to <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Their <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity is an advance even upon that of Didymus, and is very near indeed to the Roman <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which was later embodied in the <a href="02033b.htm">Athanasian creed</a>. But it had taken a long while for the East to assimilate the entire meaning of the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> view. St. Basil showed great patience with those who had advanced less far on the right road than himself, and he even tempered his language so as to conciliate them. For fame of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> scarcely any of the Fathers, save <a href="07015a.htm">St. Gregory the Wonder-Worker</a>, or <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, has ever equalled him. He practised extraordinary <a href="01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, and his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> were all <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. He composed a rule for <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> which has remained practically the only one in the East. <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory</a> had far less <a href="03584b.htm">character</a>, but equal abilities and learning, with greater eloquence. The <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> which persuaded the friends in their youth to publish a book of extracts from his writings had little influence on their later <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>; that of <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory</a> in particular is renowned for its accuracy or even inerrancy. <a href="07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> is, on the other hand, full of <a href="11306b.htm">Origenism</a>. The classical culture and literary form of the Cappadocians, united to <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, makes them a unique group in the <a href="07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>.</p>

<p>(4) The Antiochene <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the fourth century seemed given over to <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, until the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> when the great Alexandrians, Athanasius and Didymus, were dying, when it was just reviving not merely into <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, but into an efflorescence by which the recent <a href="06585a.htm">glory</a> of Alexandria and even of Cappadocia was to be surpassed. Diodorus, a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> at Antioch and then <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, was a noble supporter of Nicene <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and a great writer, though the larger part of his works has perished. His friend <a href="14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> was a learned and judicious commentator in the literal Antiochene style, but unfortunately his opposition to the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="01617a.htm">Apollinarius of Laodicea</a> carried him into the opposite extreme of <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> &#151; indeed the pupil <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> scarcely went so far as the master Theodore. But then <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> resisted the judgment of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereas Theodore died in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion, and was the friend of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, including that crowning glory of the Antiochene <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, whose greatest <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> were preached at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, before he became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople. Chrysostom is of course the chief of the <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> Fathers, the first of all commentators, and the first of all orators whether in East or <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. He was for a time a <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a>, and remained ascetic in his life; he was also a fervent social reformer. His grandeur of <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> makes him worthy of a place beside St. Basil and <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>.</p>

<p>As Basil and <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory</a> were formed to <a href="11271a.htm">oratory</a> by the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> Prohaeresius, so was Chrysostom by the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> orator Libanius. In the classical <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory</a> we may sometimes find the rhetorician; in Chrysostom never; his amazing natural talent prevents his needing the assistance of art, and though training had preceded, it has been lost in the flow of energetic thought and the torrent of words. He is not afraid of repeating himself and of neglecting the rules, for he never wishes to be admired, but only to instruct or to persuade. But even so great a man has his limitations. He has no speculative interest in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, though he is learned enough to be absolutely <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. He is a <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> man and a practical man, so that his thoughts are full of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and beauty and wisdom; but he is not a thinker. None of the Fathers has been more imitated or more read; but there is little in his writings which can be said to have moulded his own or future times, and he cannot come for an instant into competition with <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> or <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a> for the first place among <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers.</p>

<p>(5) <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> in the fourth century produced one great writer, <a href="05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a>, <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> (306-73). Most of his writings are poetry; his commentaries are in prose, but the remains of these are scantier. His <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> and <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> are all in metre, and are of very great beauty. Such tender and loving <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> is hardly found elsewhere in the Fathers. The twenty-three <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> of <a href="01593c.htm">Aphraates</a> (326-7), a Mesopotamian <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, are of great interest.</p>

<p>(6) <a href="07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a> is the most famous of the earlier opponents of <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a> in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. He wrote commentaries and polemical works, including the great treatise <a href="../fathers/3302.htm">"De Trinitate"</a> and a lost historical work. His style is affectedly involved and obscure, but he is nevertheless a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> of considerable merit. The very name of his treatise on the Trinity shows that he approached the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> from the <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> point of view of a Trinity in Unity, but he has largely employed the works of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Athanasius, and other Easterns. His <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> is of the allegorical type. Until his day, the only great <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> Father was <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, and Hilary had no rival in his own generation. <a href="09410b.htm">Lucifer</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03139c.htm">Calaris</a> in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, was a very rude controversialist, who wrote in a popular and almost uneducated manner. The <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> <a href="07009a.htm">Gregory of Illiberis</a>, in Southern <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, is only now beginning to receive his due, since Dom A. Wilmart restored to him in 1908 the important so-called "Tractatus Origenis de libris SS. Scripturae", which he and Batiffol had published in 1900, as genuine works of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> translated by <a href="15414a.htm">Victorinus of Pettau</a>. The commentaries and anti-Arian works of the <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> rhetorician, <a href="15414b.htm">Marius Victorinus</a>, were not successful. <a href="05614b.htm">St. Eusebius of Vercellae</a> has left us only a few letters. The <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the short discourses of <a href="15754d.htm">Zeno of Verona</a> is uncertain. The fine letter of <a href="08561a.htm">Pope Julius I</a> to the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a> and a few letters of <a href="09217a.htm">Liberius</a> and Damasus are of great interest.</p>

<p>The greatest of the opponents of <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a> in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> is <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (d. 397). His <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and his great actions make him one of the most imposing figures in the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> period. Unfortunately the style of his writings is often unpleasant, being affected and intricate, without being correct or artistic. His <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> is not merely of the most extreme allegorical kind, but so fanciful as to be sometimes positively absurd. And yet, when off his guard, he speaks with genuine and touching eloquence; he produces apophthegms of admirable brevity, and without being a deep <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>, he shows a wonderful profundity of thought on <a href="01767c.htm">ascetical</a>, <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a>, and devotional matters. Just as his <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> demands our enthusiastic admiration, so his writings gain our affectionate respect, in spite of their very irritating defects. It is easy to see that he is very well read in the classics and in <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers of East and <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, but his best thoughts are all his own.</p>

<p>(7) At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> an original, odd, and learned writer composed a commentary on <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> and a series of questions on the Old and New Testaments. He is usually spoken of as <a href="01406a.htm">Ambrosiaster</a>, and may perhaps be a <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> named Isaac, who later <a href="01624b.htm">apostatized</a>. <a href="04613a.htm">St. Damasus</a> wrote verses which are poor poetry but interesting where they give us information about the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. His secretary for a time was <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, a Pannonian by birth, a Roman by <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. This learned Father, "Doctor maximus in Sacris Scripturis", is very well known to us, for almost all that he wrote is a <a href="13001a.htm">revelation</a> of himself. He tells the reader of his inclinations and his antipathies, his enthusiasms and his irritations, his friendships and his enmities. If he is often out of temper, he is most human, most affectionate, most ascetic, most devoted to <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and in many ways a very lovable <a href="03584b.htm">character</a>; for if he is quick to take offence, he is easily appeased, he is laborious beyond ordinary endurance, and it is against <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> that his <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a> is usually kindled. He lived all the latter part of his life in a <a href="12795b.htm">retreat</a> at <a href="02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, surrounded by loving <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whose untiring devotion shows that the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> was by no means such a rough diamond, one might say such an ogre, as he is often represented. He had no taste for <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and seldom gave himself <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> to think, but he read and wrote ceaselessly. His many commentaries are brief and to the point, full of information, and the product of wide reading. His greatest work was the translation of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> from the Hebrew into Latin. He carried on the textual labours of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a>, and <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, and his revision of the Latin <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a> shows the use of admirably pure Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, though he seems to have expended less pains on the rest of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. He attacked <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> with much of the cleverness, all the vivacity, and much more than the eloquence and effectiveness of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. He used the like weapons against any who attacked him, and especially against his friend Rufinus during their passing period of hostility.</p>

<p>If he is only "perhaps" the most learned of the Fathers, he is beyond <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> the greatest of prose writers among them all. We cannot compare his energy and wit with the originality and polish of Cicero, or with the delicate perfection of <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a>, but neither can they or any other writer be compared with Jerome in his own sphere. He does not attempt flights of <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>, musical intonation, word-painting; he has no flow of honeyed language like <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, no torrent of phrases like Chrysostom; he is a writer, not an orator, and a learned and classical writer. But such letters as his, for astonishing force and liveliness, for point, and wit, and terse expression, were never written before or since. There is no sense of effort, and though we feel that the language must have been studied, we are rarely tempted to call it studied language, for Jerome knows the strange secret of polishing his steel weapons while they are still at a white heat, and of hurling them before they cool. He was a dangerous adversary, and had few scruples in taking every possible advantage. He has the unfortunate defect of his extraordinary swiftness, that he is extremely inaccurate, and his historical statements need careful control. His biographies of the <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a>, his words about <a href="12748b.htm">monastic life</a>, <a href="15458a.htm">virginity</a>, Roman <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, our <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Lady</a>, <a href="12734a.htm">relics of saints</a>, have exercised great influence. It has only been known of late years that Jerome was a preacher; the little extempore discourses published by Dom Mona are full of his irrepressible <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> and his careless learning.</p>

<p>(8) <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> was a stranger to the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> struggle, being occupied with a battle of its own. <a href="05121a.htm">Donatism</a> (311-411) was for a long <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> paramount in Numidia, and sometimes in other parts. The writings of the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> have mostly perished. About 370 <a href="11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> published an effective controversial work against them. The attack was carried on by a yet greater controversialist, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, with a marvellous success, so that the inveterate <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> was practically at an end twenty years before that saint's death. So <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> an event turned the eyes of all <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> to the brilliant protagonist of the <a href="01181a.htm">African</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who had already dealt crushing blows at the Latin <a href="09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> writers. From 417 till his death in 431, he was engaged in an even greater conflict with the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="10713a.htm">naturalistic</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and Caelestius. In this he was at first assisted by the aged Jerome; the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> condemned the innovators and the emperor legislated against them. If <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> has the unique fame of having prostrated three <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, it is because he was as anxious to persuade as to refute. He was perhaps the greatest controversialist the world has ever seen. Besides this he was not merely the greatest <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> among the Fathers, but he was the only great <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. His purely <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works, especially his <a href="../fathers/1301.htm">"De Trinitate"</a>, are unsurpassed for depth, grasp, and clearness, among early <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, whether Eastern or <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a>. As a <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> he has no superior, except his own son and <a href="05029a.htm">disciple</a>, <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. It is probably correct to say that no one, except <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, has exercised so vast, so profound, and so beneficial an influence on <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> thought.</p>

<p><a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a> was himself a <a href="12159a.htm">Platonist</a> through and through. As a commentator he cared little for the letter, and everything for the spirit, but his harmony of the <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a> shows that he could attend to history and detail. The allegorizing tendencies he inherited from his spiritual father, Ambrose, carry him now and then into extravagances, but more often he rather soars than commentates, and his "In Genesim ad litteram", and his treatises on the Psalms and on St. John, are works of extraordinary power and interest, and quite worthy, in a totally different style, to rank with Chrysostom on Matthew. <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was a professor of rhetoric before his wonderful <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a>; but like <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, and even more than <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, he put aside, as a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, all the artifices of <a href="11271a.htm">oratory</a> which he <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> so well. He retained correctness of grammar and perfect good taste, together with the power of speaking and writing with ease in a style of masterly simplicity and of dignified though almost colloquial plainness.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Nothing could be more individual than this style of St. Augustine's, in which he talks to the reader or to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> with perfect openness and with an astonishing, often almost exasperating, subtlety of thought. He had the power of seeing all round a subject and through and through it, and he was too conscientious not to use this gift to the uttermost. Large-minded and far-seeing, he was also very learned. He mastered Greek only in later life, in order to make himself familiar with the works of the Eastern Fathers. His <a href="../fathers/1201.htm">"De Civitate Dei"</a> shows vast stores of reading; still more, it puts him in the first place among <a href="01618a.htm">apologists</a>. Before his death (431) he was the object of extraordinary veneration. He had founded a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="14553b.htm">Tagaste</a>, which supplied <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> with <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and he lived at <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> with his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in a common life, to which the <a href="03288a.htm">Regular Canons</a> of later days have always looked as their model. The great <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, the Augustinians, and numberless congregations of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> still look to him as their father and legislator. His devotional works have had a vogue second only to that of another of his spiritual sons, <a href="14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>. He had in his lifetime a <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and his <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> is felt in all his writings, and breathes in the story of his life. It has been remarked that there is about this many-sided <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> a certain symmetry which makes him an almost faultless model of a <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a>, wise, and active man. It is well to remember that he was essentially a penitent.</p>

<p>(9) In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the great poet Prudentius surpassed all his predecessors, of whom the best had been <a href="08586b.htm">Juvencus</a> and the almost <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> rhetorician <a href="02112d.htm">Ausonius</a>. The curious treatises of the <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="12429b.htm">Priscillian</a> were discovered only in 1889. In Gaul Rufinus of Aquileia must be mentioned as the very free translator of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, etc., and of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius's</a> "History", which he continued up to his own <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>. In South <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> his friend <a href="11585b.htm">Paulinus of Nola</a> has left us pious poems and elaborate letters.</p>

<h3 id="D">D</h3>

<p>(1) The fragments of <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorius's</a> writings have been collected by Loofs. Some of them were preserved by a <a href="05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="09672b.htm">Marius Mercator</a>, who made two collections of documents, concerning <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> respectively. The great adversary of <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, <a href="04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>, was opposed by a yet greater writer, <a href="14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cyrus. Cyril is a very voluminous writer, and his long <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> in the <a href="10663b.htm">mystical</a> Alexandrian vein do not much interest modern readers. But his principal letters and treatises on the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> question show him as a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> who has a deep spiritual insight into the meaning of the <a href="07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and its effect upon the <a href="09580c.htm">human race</a> &#151; the lifting up of <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> to union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. We see here the influence of <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, from Anthony the Great (whose life <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> wrote), and the Macarii (one of whom left some valuable works in Greek), and Pachomius, to his own time. In their <a href="01767c.htm">ascetical</a> systems, the union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="04324b.htm">contemplation</a> was naturally the end in view, but one is surprised how little is made by them of meditation on the <a href="09238c.htm">life</a> and <a href="11530a.htm">Passion of Christ</a>. It is not omitted, but the tendency as with St. Cyril and with the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> who <a href="02408b.htm">believed</a> they followed him, is to think rather of the <a href="06608a.htm">Godhead</a> than of the Manhood. The Antiochene <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> had exaggerated the contrary tendency, out of opposition to <a href="01615b.htm">Apollinarianism</a>, which made <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Manhood incomplete, and they thought more of <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> united to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> than of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="09580c.htm">man</a>.</p>

<p><a href="14574b.htm">Theodoret</a> undoubtedly avoided the excesses of Theodore and <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was accepted at last by <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> as <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, in spite of his earlier persistent defence of <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>. His history of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> is less valuable than the earlier writings of eyewitnesses &#151; <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> in the East, and Rufinus and afterwards Cassian in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. But <a href="14574b.htm">Theodoret's</a> "History" in continuation of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> contains valuable information. His <a href="01618a.htm">apologetic</a> and controversial writings are the works of a good <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>. His masterpieces are his <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works, which are neither <a href="11271a.htm">oratory</a> like those of Chrysostom, nor exaggeratedly literal like those of Theodore. With him the great Antiochene school worthily closes, as the Alexandrian does with St. Cyril. Together with these great men may be mentioned St. Cyril's <a href="05024a.htm">spiritual adviser</a>, <a href="08185c.htm">St. Isidore of Pelusium</a>, whose 2000 letters deal chiefly with allegorical <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, the commentary on <a href="09674a.htm">St. Mark</a> by Victor of Antioch, and the introduction to the interpretation of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> by the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="01160a.htm">Hadrian</a>, a manual of the Antiochene method.</p>

<p>(2) The <a href="05633a.htm">Eutychian</a> controversy produced no great works in the East. Such works of the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> as have survived are in <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a> or <a href="16078c.htm">Coptic versions</a>.</p>

<p>(3) The two Constantinopolitan historians, <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, in spite of <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>, contain some data which are precious, since many of the sources which they used are lost to us. With <a href="14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, their contemporary, they form a triad just in the middle of the century. <a href="11079b.htm">St. Nilus of Sinai</a> is the chief among many <a href="01767c.htm">ascetical</a> writers.</p>

<p>(4) St. Sulpicius Severus, a Gallic noble, <a href="05029a.htm">disciple</a> and biographer of the great <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, was a classical scholar, and showed himself an elegant writer in his "Ecclesiastical History". The <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="09188b.htm">L&eacute;rins</a> produced many writers besides St. Vincent. We may mention Eucherius, Faustus, and the great <a href="03135b.htm">St. Caesarius of Arles</a> (543). Other Gallic writers are Salvian, St. Sidonius Apollinaris, <a href="06417a.htm">Gennadius</a>, <a href="02161c.htm">St. Avitus of Vienne</a>, and Julianus Pomerius.</p>

<p>(5) In the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, the series of <a href="04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> begins with <a href="14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (384-98). Of the more important <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> large numbers of letters have been preserved. Those of the wise St. Innocent I (401-17), the hot-headed St. Zosimus (417-8), and the severe St. Celestine are perhaps the most important in the first half of the century; in the second half those of <a href="07348b.htm">Hilarus</a>, <a href="14002a.htm">Simplicius</a>, and above all the learned St. Gelasius (492-6). Midway in the century stands <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>, the greatest of the early <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, whose steadfastness and <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> saved <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from <a href="02061b.htm">Attila</a>, and the Romans from Genseric. He could be unbending in the enunciation of principle; he was condescending in the condoning of breaches of <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> for the sake of peace, and he was a skilful diplomatist. His sermons and the dogmatic letters in his large correspondence show him to us as the most lucid of all <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>. He is clear in his expression, not because he is superficial, but because he has thought clearly and deeply. He steers between <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="05633a.htm">Eutychianism</a>, not by using subtle distinctions or elaborate arguments, but by stating plain definitions in accurate words. He condemned <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> by anticipation. His style is careful, with metrical cadences. Its majestic rhythms and its sonorous closes have invested the Latin language with a new splendour and dignity.</p>

<h3 id="E">E</h3>

<p>(1) In the sixth century the large correspondence of <a href="07470a.htm">Pope Hormisdas</a> is of the highest interest. That century closes with <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, whose celebrated "Registrum" exceeds in volume many times over the collections of the letters of other early <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. The Epistles are of great variety and throw light on the varied interests of the great <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> life and the varied events in the East and <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> of his <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>. His "Morals on the Book of Job" is not a literal commentary, but pretends only to illustrate the moral sense underlying the text. With all the strangeness it presents to modern notions, it is a work full of wisdom and instruction. The remarks of <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> on the spiritual life and on <a href="04324b.htm">contemplation</a> are of special interest. As a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> he is original only in that he combines all the traditional <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> without adding to it. He commonly follows <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a> as a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, a commentator and a preacher. His <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> are admirably practical; they are models of what a good <a href="07448a.htm">sermon</a> should be. After <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> there are some great <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> whose letters are worthy of study, such as <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> and <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a>; but these and the many other late writers of the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> belong properly to the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> period. <a href="07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> is certainly <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a>, but the learned <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a> is quite <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a>. His great history is the most faithful and perfect <a href="07365a.htm">history</a> to be found in the early centuries.</p>

<p>(2) In the East, the latter half of the fifth century is very barren. The sixth century is not much better. The importance of <a href="09179b.htm">Leontius of Byzantium</a> (died c. 543) for the history of <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> has only lately been realized. Poets and <a href="07106b.htm">hagiographers</a>, chroniclers, canonists, and <a href="01767c.htm">ascetical</a> writers succeed each other. Catenas by way of <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> are the order of the day. <a href="10078b.htm">St. Maximus Confessor</a>, <a href="01455d.htm">Anastasius of Mount Sinai</a>, and <a href="01473a.htm">Andrew of Caesarea</a> must be named. The first of these commented on the works of the <a href="05013a.htm">pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, which had probably first seen the light towards the end of the fifth century. <a href="08459b.htm">St. John of Damascus</a> (c. 750) closes the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> period with his polemics against <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, his <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> and <a href="01767c.htm">ascetical</a> writings, his beautiful <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and above all his "Fountain of Wisdom", which is a compendium of <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and a kind of anticipation of <a href="13548a.htm">scholasticism</a>. Indeed, the <a href="14333c.htm">"Summae Theologicae"</a> of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> were founded on the "Sentences" of <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, who had taken the skeleton of his work from this <a href="08459b.htm">last of the Greek Fathers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics of patristic writings</h2>

<h3 id="A">Commentaries</h3>

<p>It has been seen that the literal school of <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> had its home at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, while the allegorical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was Alexandrian, and the entire <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, on the whole, followed the allegorical method, mingling literalism with it in various degrees. The suspicion of <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a> has lost to us the fourth-century writers of the Antiochene <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, such as Theodore of Heraclea and Eusebius of Emesa, and the charge of <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> has <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> the <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> of Diodorus and <a href="14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> (for the most part) to disappear. The Alexandrian school has lost yet more heavily, for little of the great <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> remains except in fragments and in unreliable versions. The great Antiochenes, Chrysostom and <a href="14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, have a real grasp of the sense of the <a href="../bible.html">sacred text</a>. They treat it with reverence and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, and their explanations are of deep value, because the language of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was their own tongue, so that we moderns cannot afford to neglect their comments. On the contrary, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, the moulder of the allegorizing type of commentary, who had inherited the Philonic tradition of the Alexandrian <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, was essentially irreverent to the inspired authors. The <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was to him full of <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>, lies, and <a href="02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, so far as the letter was concerned, and his defence of it against the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>, the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, and especially the <a href="09645c.htm">Marcionites</a>, was to point only to the spiritual meaning. Theoretically he distinguished a triple sense, the somatic, the psychic, and the pneumatic, following <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> trichotomy; but in practice he mainly gives the spiritual, as opposed to the corporal or literal.</p>

<p><a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> sometimes defends the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> against the <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> in the same style, and occasionally in a most unconvincing manner, but with great moderation and restraint. In his "De Genesi ad litteram" he has evolved a far more effective method, with his usual brilliant originality, and he shows that the objections brought against the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of the first chapters of the book invariably rest upon the baseless assumption that the objector has found the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the text. But <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> applied his method, though partially, even to the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and regarded the <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> as sometimes <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> in the letter, but as saving the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> in the hidden spiritual meaning. In this point the good feeling of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> prevented his being followed. But the brilliant example he gave, of running riot in the fantastic <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> which his method encouraged, had an unfortunate influence. He is fond of giving a variety of applications to a single text, and his promise to hold nothing but what can be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> from <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> becomes illusory when he shows by example that any part of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> may mean anything he pleases. The reverent temper of later writers, and especially of the <a href="09022a.htm">Westerns</a>, preferred to represent as the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the sacred writer the allegory which appeared to them to be the most obvious. <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> and <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in their beautiful works on the Psalms rather spiritualize, or moralize, than allegorize, and their <a href="07672a.htm">imaginative</a> interpretations are chiefly of events, actions, numbers, etc. But almost all allegorical interpretation is so arbitrary and depends so much on the caprice of the <a href="05692b.htm">exegete</a> that it is difficult to conciliate it with reverence, however one may be dazzled by the beauty of much of it. An alternative way of defending the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was excogitated by the ingenious author of the pseudo-Clementines; he asserts that it has been depraved and interpolated. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> learning has made his <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> unique; he frequently gives alternative explanations and refers to the authors who have adopted them. From the middle of the fifth century onwards, second-hand commentaries are universal in East and <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, and originality almost entirely disappears. <a href="01473a.htm">Andrew of Caesarea</a> is perhaps an exception, for he commented on a book which was scarcely at all read in the East, the <a href="01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a>.</p>

<p>Discussions of method are not wanting. <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> gives "traditional methods", the literal, typical, moral, and prophetical. The tradition is obviously from <a href="12617b.htm">Rabbinism</a>. We must admit that it has in its favour the practice of <a href="10056b.htm">St. Matthew</a> and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Even more than <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> theorized on this subject. In his "De Doctrina Christiana" he gives elaborate rules of <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. Elsewhere he distinguishes four senses of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a>: historical, aetiological (economic), analogical (where N.T. explains O.T.), and allegorical ("De Util. Cred.", 3; cf. "De Vera Rel.", 50). The book of rules composed by the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="14721d.htm">Tichonius</a> has an <a href="01449a.htm">analogy</a> in the smaller "canons" of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> by <a href="12429b.htm">Priscillian</a>. Hadrian of Antioch was mentioned above. <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> compares <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> to a river so shallow that a lamb can walk in it, so deep that an elephant can float. (Pref. to "Morals on Job"). He distinguishes the historical or literal sense, the moral, and the allegorical or typical. If the <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> Fathers are fanciful, yet this is better than the extreme literalism of <a href="14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, who refused to allegorize even the <a href="03302a.htm">Canticle of Canticles</a>.</p>

<h3 id="preachers">Preachers</h3>

<p>We have <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> from the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> much earlier than from the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a>. Indeed, <a href="14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> tells us that, up to his time (c. 450), there were no public <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> in the churches at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This seems almost incredible. <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo's</a> <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> are, however, the first <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> certainly preached at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> which have reached us, for those of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> were all in Greek; unless the <a href="07448a.htm">homily</a> "Adversus Alcatores" be a <a href="07448a.htm">sermon</a> by a <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>. The series of Latin preachers begins in the middle of the fourth century. The so-called "Second Epistle of St. Clement" is a <a href="07448a.htm">homily</a> belonging possibly to the second century. Many of the <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> are a series of <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>, as is the case later with all Chrysostom's <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> and most of Augustine's.</p>

<p>In many cases treatises are composed of a course of <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>, as, for instance, is the case for some of those of Ambrose, who seems to have rewritten his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> after delivery. The "De Sacramentis" may possibly be the version by a shorthand-writer of the course which the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> himself edited under the title "De Mysteriis". In any case the "De Sacramentis" (whether by Ambrose or not) has a freshness and naivet&eacute; which is wanting in the certainly <a href="02137a.htm">authentic</a> "De Mysteriis". Similarly the great courses of <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> preached by St. Chrysostom at Antioch were evidently written or corrected by his own hand, but those he delivered at Constantinople were either hurriedly corrected, or not at all. His <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> on <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a>, which have come down to us in two quite distinct texts in the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, are probably known to us only in the forms in which they were taken down by two different tachygraphers. <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> complains of the importunity of these shorthand-writers (Orat. xxxii), as <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> does of their incapacity (Ep. lxxi, 5). Their art was evidently highly perfected, and specimens of it have come down to us. They were officially employed at councils (e.g. at the great conference with the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in 411, we hear of them). It appears that many or most of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the Council of Ephesus, in 449, had their own shorthand-writers with them. The method of taking notes and of amplifying receives illustration from the Acts of the Council of Constantinople of 27 April, 449, at which the minutes were examined which had been taken down by tachygraphers at the council held a few weeks earlier.</p>

<p>Many of St. Augustine's <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> are certainly from shorthand notes. As to others we are uncertain, for the style of the written ones is often so colloquial that it is difficult to get a criterion. The <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> of <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> at <a href="02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, published by <a href="10570b.htm">Dom Morin</a>, are from shorthand reports, and the discourses themselves were unprepared conferences on those portions of the <a href="../bible/psa000.htm">Psalms</a> or of the <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a> which had been sung in the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgy</a>. The speaker has clearly often been preceded by another <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, and on the <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, which his community alone is keeping, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is present and will speak last. In fact the pilgrim &AElig;theria tells us that at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in the fourth century, all the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> present spoke in turn, if they chose, and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> last of all. Such improvised comments are far indeed from the oratorical discourses of <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a>, from the lofty flights of Chrysostom, from the torrent of iteration that characterizes the short <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> of Peter Chrysologus, from the neat phrases of <a href="10081a.htm">Maximus of Turin</a>, and the ponderous rhythms of <a href="09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a>. The eloquence of these Fathers need not be here described. In the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> we may add in the fourth century <a href="06394a.htm">Gaudentius of Brescia</a>; several small collections of interesting <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> appear in the fifth century; the sixth opens with the numerous <a href="04104b.htm">collections</a> made by St. Caesarius for the use of preachers. There is practically no edition of the works of this eminent and practical <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> (apart from some fanciful <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a>) is the most practical preacher of the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. Nothing could be more admirable for imitation than St. Chrysostom. The more ornate writers are less safe to copy. St. Augustine's style is too personal to be an example, and few are so learned, so great, and so ready, that they can venture to speak as simply as he often does.</p>

<h3 id="writers">Writers</h3>

<p>The Fathers do not belong to the strictly classical period of either the Greek or the Latin language; but this does not imply that they wrote bad Latin or Greek. The conversational form of the Koin&eacute; or common dialect of Greek, which is found in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and in many papyri, is not the language of the Fathers, except of the very earliest. For the <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> Fathers write in a more classicizing style than most of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writers; none of them uses quite a vulgar or ungrammatical Greek, while some Atticize, e.g. the Cappadocians and <a href="14386a.htm">Synesius</a>. The <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> Fathers are often less classical. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> is a Latin Carlyle; he <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> Greek, and wrote books in that language, and tried to introduce <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> terms into Latin. <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> "Ad Donatum", probably his first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> writing, shows an Apuleian preciosity which he eschewed in all his other works, but which his biographer Pontius has imitated and exaggerated. Men like <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a> and <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, who had a thorough <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of classical literature, would not employ tricks of style, and cultivated a manner which should be correct, but simple and straightforward; yet their style could not have been what it was but for their previous study. For the spoken Latin of all the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> centuries was very different from the written. We get examples of the vulgar tongue here and there in the letters of <a href="04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> as edited by <a href="09672b.htm">Mercati</a>, for the third century, or in the <a href="02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> in W&ouml;lfflin's or Dom Mona's editions, for the sixth. In the latter we get such modernisms as <em>cor murmurantem, post quibus, cum responsoria sua</em>, which show how the confusing genders and cases of the classics were disappearing into the more reasonable simplicity of Italian. Some of the Fathers use the rhythmical endings of the "cursus" in their prose; some have the later accented endings which were corruptions of the correct prosodical ones. Familiar examples of the former are in the older Collects of the Mass; of the latter the <em>Te Deum</em> is an obvious instance.</p>

<h3 id="east">East and West</h3>

<p>Before speaking of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> characteristics of the Fathers, we have to take into account the great division of the Roman Empire into two languages. Language is the great separator. When two emperors divided the Empire, it was not quite according to language; nor were the ecclesiastical divisions more exact, since the great province of Illyricum, including <a href="12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> and all <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a>, was attached to the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> through at least a large part of the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> period, and was governed by the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, not as its <a href="05676b.htm">exarch</a> or patriarch, but as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. But in considering the literary productions of the age, we must class them as Latin or Greek, and this is what will be meant here by <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> and Eastern.</p>

<p>The understanding of the relations between Greeks and <a href="09022a.htm">Latins</a> is often obscured by certain prepossessions. We talk of the "unchanging East", of the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> Greeks as opposed to the practical <a href="09022a.htm">Romans</a>, of the reposeful thought of the Oriental <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> over against the rapidity and orderly classification which characterizes <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> intelligence. All this is very misleading, and it is important to go back to the facts. In the first place, the East was <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> far more rapidly than the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. When Constantine made <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the established religion of both empires from 323 onwards, there was a striking contrast between the two. In the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> had everywhere a very large <a href="09557a.htm">majority</a>, except possibly in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>. But in the Greek world <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was quite the equal of the old <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> in influence and numbers; in the great cities it might even be predominant, and some towns were practically <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. The story told of <a href="07015a.htm">St. Gregory the Wonder-Worker</a>, that he found but seventeen <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Neoc&aelig;sarea when he became <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that he left but seventeen <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> in the same city when he died (c. 270-5), must be substantially <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>. Such a story in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> would be absurd. The villages of the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> countries held out for long, and the <em>pagani</em> retained the worship of the old gods even after they were all nominally <a href="03712a.htm">Christianized</a>. In Phrygia, on the contrary, entire villages were <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> long before Constantine, though it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that elsewhere some towns were still <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> in <a href="08558b.htm">Julian's</a> day &#151; <a href="06399c.htm">Gaza</a> in Palestine is an example; but then Maiouma, the port of <a href="06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, was <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>

<p>Two consequences, amongst others, of this swift evangelization of the East must be noticed. In the first place, while the slow progress of the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> was favourable to the preservation of the unchanged tradition, the quick <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the East was accompanied by a rapid development which, in the sphere of <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, was hasty, unequal, and fruitful of <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>. Secondly, the Eastern religion partook, even during the heroic age of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, of the <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> which the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> felt so deeply after Constantine, that is to say, of the crowding into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of multitudes who were only half <a href="03712a.htm">Christianized</a>, because it was the fashionable thing to do, or because a part of the beauties of the new religion and of the absurdities of the old were seen. We have actually <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers, in East and <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, such as <a href="01746c.htm">Arnobius</a>, and to some extent <a href="08736a.htm">Lactantius</a> and <a href="08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a>, who show that they are only half instructed in the <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. This must have been largely the case among the people in the East. <a href="15006b.htm">Tradition</a> in the East was less regarded, and <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> was less deep than in the smaller <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> communities. Again, the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> writers begin in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> with <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, just before the third century, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, just in the middle of the third century, and in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Gaul not till the fourth. But the East had writers in the first century, and numbers in the second; there were <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in the second and third. There had been, indeed, Greek writers at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the first and second centuries and part of the third. But when the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> became Latin they were forgotten; the Latin writers did not cite Clement and Hermas; they totally forgot <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, except his chronicle, and his name became merely a theme for legend.</p>

<p>Though <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was powerful and <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the second century, and though her tradition remained unbroken, the break in her literature is complete. <a href="09032a.htm">Latin literature</a> is thus a century and a half younger than the Greek; indeed it is practically two centuries and a half younger. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> stands alone, and he became a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Until the middle of the fourth century there had appeared but one Latin Father for the spiritual reading of the <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Christian</a>, and it is natural that the stichometry, edited (perhaps semi-officially) under <a href="09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> for the control of booksellers' prices, gives the works of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> as well as the books of the Latin Bible. This unique position of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> was still recognized at the beginning of the fifth century. From <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> (d. 258) to Hilary there was scarcely a Latin book that could be recommended for popular reading except <a href="08736a.htm">Lactantius's</a> "De mortibus persecutorum", and there was no <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> at all. Even a little later, the <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> of Victorinus the Rhetorician were valueless, and those of Isaac the Jew (?) were odd. The one vigorous period of <a href="09032a.htm">Latin literature</a> is the bare century which ends with Leo (d. 461). During that century <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> had been repeatedly captured or threatened by barbarians; <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, besides devastating <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Gaul, had almost destroyed the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>; the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> British had been <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> in the English invasion. Yet the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> had been able to rival the East in output and in eloquence and even to surpass it in learning, depth, and variety. The elder sister knew little of these productions, but the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> was supplied with a considerable body of translations from the Greek, even in the fourth century. In the sixth, <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> took care that the amount should be increased. This gave the <a href="09022a.htm">Latins</a> a larger outlook, and even the decay of learning which <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> and Agapetus could not remedy, and which <a href="01204c.htm">Pope Agatho</a> deplored so humbly in his letter to the Greek council of 680, was resisted with a certain persistent vigour.</p>

<p>At Constantinople the means of learning were abundant, and there were many authors; yet there is a gradual decline till the fifteenth century. The more notable writers are like flickers amid dying embers. There were chroniclers and chronographers, but with little originality. Even the <a href="14316c.htm">monastery of Studium</a> is hardly a literary revival. There is in the East no enthusiasm like that of <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, of Isidore, of <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, amid a barbarian world. <a href="12043b.htm">Photius</a> had wonderful <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a> at his disposal, yet <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a> had wider learning, and probably <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> more of the East than <a href="12043b.htm">Photius</a> did of the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. The industrious <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> which propagated learning in every part of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> had no parallel in the Oriental world. It was after the fifth century that the East began to be "unchanging". And as the bond with the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> grew less and less continuous, her <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and literature became more and more mummified; whereas the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin world</a> blossomed anew with an Anselm, subtle as <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, a Bernard, rival to <a href="08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>, an <a href="14663b.htm">Aquinas</a>, prince of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>.</p>

<p>Hence we observe in the early centuries a twofold movement, which must be spoken of separately: an Eastward movement of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, by which the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> imposed her <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a> on the reluctant East, and a Westward movement in most practical things &#151; organization, <a href="09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, ascetics, devotion &#151; by which the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> assimilated the swifter evolution of the Greeks. We take first the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> movement.</p>

<h3 id="theology">Theology</h3>

<p>Throughout the second century the Greek portion of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> bred <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The multitude of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> tried to introduce all kinds of foreign elements into <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Those who taught and <a href="02408b.htm">believed</a> them did not start from a <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Trinity and the <a href="07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> such as we are accustomed to. <a href="09645c.htm">Marcion</a> formed not a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, but a <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; his <a href="14597a.htm">Christology</a> was very far removed from tradition. The <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a> made a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> which retained the <a href="15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices, but asserted a new <a href="13001a.htm">revelation</a>. The leaders of all the new views came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and tried to gain a footing there; all were condemned and <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. At the end of the century, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> got all the East to agree with her traditional rule that <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> should be kept on <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Churches</a> of <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> had a different <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a>. One of their <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> protested. But they seem to have submitted almost at once. In the first decades of the third century, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> impartially repelled opposing <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, those which identified the three <a href="11726a.htm">Persons</a> of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> with only a modal distinction (<a href="10448a.htm">Monarchians</a>, Sabellians, "Patripassians"), and those who, on the contrary, made <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> a mere <a href="09580c.htm">man</a>, or seemed to ascribe to the <a href="09328a.htm">Word of God</a> a distinct being from that of the Father. This last conception, to our amazement, is assumed, it would appear, by the early Greek <a href="01618a.htm">apologists</a>, though in varying language; <a href="02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a> (who as an Athenian may have been in relation with the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>) is the only one who asserts the Unity of the Trinity. <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (somewhat diversely in the "Contra Noetum" and in the "Philosophumena," if they are both his) taught the same division of the Son from the Father as traditional, and he records that <a href="12260a.htm">Pope Callistus</a> condemned him as a Ditheist.</p>

<p><a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, like many of the others, makes the procession of the Word depend upon His office of Creator; and if he is <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> enough to make the procession an <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> and <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> one, this is only because he regards <a href="04470a.htm">Creation</a> itself as <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> and <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a>. His pupil, <a href="05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, in combating the Sabellians, who admitted no real distinctions in the <a href="06608a.htm">Godhead</a>, manifested the characteristic weakness of the Greek <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, but some of his own <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptians</a> were more correct than their patriarch, and <a href="01652a.htm">appealed</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Alexandrian listened to the Roman Dionysius, for all respected the unchanging tradition and unblemished <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the See of Peter; his apology accepts the word <a href="07449a.htm">"consubstantial"</a>, and he explains, no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> sincerely, that he had never meant anything else; but he had learnt to see more clearly, without recognizing how unfortunately worded were his earlier arguments. He was not present when a council, mainly of <a href="11306b.htm">Origenists</a>, justly condemned <a href="11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> (268); and these <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, holding the traditional Eastern view, refused to use the word <a href="07449a.htm">"consubstantial"</a> as being too like <a href="10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a>. The <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>, <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Lucian, rejected (as did the more moderate <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>) the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="04470a.htm">Creation</a>, and they were <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> enough to argue that consequently "there was (before <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> was) when the Word was not", and that He was a creature. All <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> was horrified; but the East was soon appeased by vague explanations, and after Nicaea, real, undisguised <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a> hardly showed its head for nearly forty years. The highest point of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> that the East could reach is shown in the admirable lectures of <a href="04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>. There is one <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, he teaches, that is the Father, and His Son is equal to Him in all things, and the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="01151a.htm">adored</a> with Them; we cannot separate Them in our worship. But he does not ask himself how there are not three <a href="06608a.htm">Gods</a>; he will not use the Nicene word <a href="07449a.htm">"consubstantial"</a>, and he never suggests that there is one <a href="06608a.htm">Godhead</a> common to the three <a href="11726a.htm">Persons</a>.</p>

<p>If we turn to the <a href="09022a.htm">Latins</a> all is different. The essential <a href="10499a.htm">Monotheism</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is not saved in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> by saying there is "one <a href="06608a.htm">God the Father</a>", as in all the Eastern <a href="04478a.htm">creeds</a>, but the <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> teach the unity of the Divine <a href="05543b.htm">essence</a>, in which subsist three <a href="11726a.htm">Persons</a>. If <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a> use subordinationist language of the Son (perhaps borrowed from the East), it is of little consequence in comparison with their main <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, that there is one <a href="14322c.htm">substance</a> of the Father and of the <a href="14142b.htm">Son</a>. Callistus <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicates</a> equally those who deny the distinction of <a href="11726a.htm">Persons</a>, and those who refuse to assert the unity of <a href="14322c.htm">substance</a>. <a href="12260a.htm">Pope Dionysius</a> is shocked that his namesake did not use the word <a href="07449a.htm">"consubstantial"</a> &#151; this is more than sixty years before Nicaea. At that great council a <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has the first place, with two Roman <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the result of the discussion is that the Roman word <a href="07449a.htm">"consubstantial"</a> is imposed up on all. In the East the council is succeeded by a conspiracy of silence; the Orientals will not use the word. Even Alexandria, which had kept to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="05009b.htm">Dionysius of Rome</a>, is not convinced that the policy was <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> and Athanasius spends his life in fighting for Nicaea, yet rarely uses the crucial word. It takes half a century for the Easterns to digest it; and when they do so, they do not make the most of its meaning. It is curious how little interest even Athanasius shows in the Unity of the Trinity, which he scarcely mentions except when quoting the Dionysii; it is Didymus and the Cappadocians who word Trinitarian <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in the manner since <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the centuries &#151; three hypostases, one usia; but this is merely the conventional translation of the ancient Latin formula, though it was new to the East.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>If we look back at the three centuries, second, third, and fourth of which we have been speaking, we shall see that the Greek-speaking <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> taught the Divinity of the Son, and Three inseparable Persons, and one <a href="06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, without being able philosophically to harmonize these conceptions. The attempts which were made were sometimes condemned as <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the one direction or the other, or at best arrived at unsatisfactory and <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> explanations, such as the distinction of the <em>logos endiathetos</em> and the <em>logos prophorikos</em> or the assertion of the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="04470a.htm">Creation</a>. The <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> preserved always the simple tradition of three distinct Persons and one divine <a href="05543b.htm">Essence</a>. We must judge the Easterns to have started from a less perfect tradition, for it would be too harsh to accuse them of wilfully perverting it. But they show their love of subtle distinctions at the same time that they lay bare their want of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> grasp. The common people talked <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> in the streets; but the professional <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> did not see that the root of religion is the unity of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and that, so far, it is better to be a Sabellian than a <a href="13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a>. There is something mythological about their conceptions, even in the case of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, however important a thinker he may be in comparison with other ancients. His conceptions of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> dominated the East for some time, but an <a href="11306b.htm">Origenist</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> would never have influenced the modern world.</p>

<p>The Latin conception of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, on the other hand, was by no means a mere adherence to an uncomprehended tradition. The Latins in each controversy of these early centuries seized the main point, and preserved it at all hazards. Never for an instant did they allow the unity of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to be obscured. The equality of the Son and his <a href="07449a.htm">consubstantiality</a> were seen to be <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to that unity. The <a href="12159a.htm">Platonist</a> <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the need of a mediator between the transcendent <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="04470a.htm">Creation</a> does not entangle them, for they were too clear-headed to suppose that there could be anything half-way between the finite and the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>. In a word, the Latins are <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and the Easterns are not. The East can speculate and wrangle about <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, but it cannot grasp a large view. It is in accordance with this that it was in the West, after all the struggle was over, that the Trinitarian <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was completely systematized by Augustine; in the West, that the <a href="02033b.htm">Athanasian creed</a> was formulated. The same story repeats itself in the fifth century. The <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> arose in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, and in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> only could it have been exorcized. The <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of Antioch and Alexandria each insisted on one side of the question as to the union of the two Natures in the <a href="07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>; the one School fell into <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, the other into <a href="05633a.htm">Eutychianism</a>, though the leaders were <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. But neither Cyril nor the great <a href="14574b.htm">Theodoret</a> was able to rise above the controversy, and express the two complementary <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> in one consistent <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. They held what <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> held; but, omitting their interminable arguments and <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a>, the Latin writer words the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> once for all, because he sees it philosophically. No wonder that the most popular of the Eastern Fathers has always been untheological Chrysostom, whereas the most popular of the <a href="09022a.htm">Western</a> Fathers is the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>. Whenever the East was severed from the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, it contributed nothing to the elucidation and development of <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, and when united, its contribution was mostly to make difficulties for the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> to unravel.</p>

<p>But the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> has continued without ceasing its work of exposition and evolution. After the fifth century there is not much development or definition in the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> period; the <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a> defined needed only a reference to antiquity. But again and again <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> had to impose her <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a> on Byzantium &#151; 519, 680, and 786 are famous <a href="04636c.htm">dates</a>, when the whole <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> had to accept a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> document for the sake of reunion, and the intervals between these <a href="04636c.htm">dates</a> supply lesser instances. The <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> had always possessed a <a href="15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in Roman tradition and in the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of recourse to the See of Peter; the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a> expressed it when they wrote to <a href="12260a.htm">Pope Julius</a> to deprecate interference &#151; <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, they said, was "the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> from the beginning". In the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries the lesson had been learnt thoroughly, and the East proclaimed the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogatives, and appealed to them with a fervour which experience had taught to be in place. In such a sketch as this, all elements cannot be taken into consideration. It is obvious that Eastern <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> had a great and varied influence on <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Christendom</a>. But the essential <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> remains that the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> thought more clearly than the East, while preserving with greater faithfulness a more explicit tradition as to cardinal <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, and that the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> imposed her doctrines and her definitions on the East, and repeatedly, if necessary, reasserted and reimposed them.</p>

<h3 id="discipline">Discipline, liturgy, ascetics</h3>

<p>According to tradition, the multiplication of <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, so that each city had its own <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, began in the province of <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>, under the direction of St. John. The development was uneven. There may have been but one see in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> at the end of the second century, though there were large numbers in all the provinces of <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and a great many in <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> and Palestine. Groupings under <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> began in that century in the East, and in the third century this organization was recognized as a matter of course. Over <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> are the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. This method of grouping spread to the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. At first <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> had the most numerous sees; in the middle of the third century there were about a hundred, and they quickly increased to more than four times that number. But each province of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> had not a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="10244c.htm">see</a>; only a presidency was accorded to the senior <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, except in Proconsularis, where Carthage was the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the province and her <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the first of all <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>. His <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> are undefined, though his influence was great. But <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was near, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had certainly far more actual power, as well as more recognized <a href="13055c.htm">right</a>, than the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a>; we see this in <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, and it remains <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> in spite of the resistance of <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>. The other countries, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, were gradually organized according to the Greek model, and the Greek <em>metropolis, patriarch</em>, were adapted. Councils were held early in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. But disciplinary canons were first enacted in the East. <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> large councils passed no canons, and that saint considered that each <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is answerable to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone for the government of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; in other words, he knows no canon law. The foundation of Latin canon law is in the canons of Eastern councils, which open the Western collections. in spite of this, we need not suppose the East was more regular, or better governed, than the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, where the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> guarded order and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. But the East had larger communities, and they had developed more fully, and therefore the need arose earlier there to commit definite rules to writing.</p>

<p>The florid taste of the East soon decorated the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgy</a> with beautiful excrescences. Many such excellent practices moved Westward; the Latin <a href="13064b.htm">rites</a> borrowed <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> and songs, <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, antiphonal singing, the use of the <a href="01319b.htm">alleluia</a>, of the <a href="05150a.htm">doxology</a>, etc. If the East adopted the Latin <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> imported not merely the Greek <a href="05504c.htm">Epiphany</a>, but <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> after <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a>, in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries. The <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> joined in devotion to Eastern <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The <a href="15459a.htm">special honour and love of Our Lady</a> is at first characteristic of the East (except Antioch), and then conquers the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. The parcelling of the bodies of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> as <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> for devotional purposes, spread all over the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> from the East; only <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> held out, until the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, against what might be thought an irreverence rather than an <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<p>If the first three centuries are full of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the East, yet from the fourth century onward <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> joins with East in making <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the principal goal of such <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> journeys; and these voyagers brought back much <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the East to the most distant parts of the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. <a href="10459a.htm">Monasticism</a> began in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with Paul and Anthony, and spread from <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>; <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> brought the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it to the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>, and the Western monachism of <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a> and <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, of Honoratus and Martin, of Benedict and Columba, always looked to the East, to Anthony and Pachomius and Hilarion, and above all to Basil, for its most perfect models. Edifying literature in the form of the lives of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> began with Athanasius, and was imitated by Jerome. But the Latin writers, Rufinus and Cassian, gave accounts of Eastern monachism, and <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> and the later Greek writers were early translated into Latin. Soon indeed there were lives of Latin <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, of which that of St. Martin was the most famous, but the year 600 had almost come when <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> felt it still necessary to protest that as good might be found in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> as in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and published his dialogues to <a href="12454c.htm">prove</a> his point, by supplying edifying stories of his own country to put beside the older histories of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. It would be out of place here to go more into detail in these subjects. Enough has been said to show that the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> borrowed, with open-minded simplicity and <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>, from the elder East all kinds of practical and useful ways in ecclesiastical affairs and in the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. The converse influence in practical matters of <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> on East was naturally very small.</p>

<h3 id="historical">Historical materials</h3>

<p>The principal ancient historians of the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> period were mentioned above. They cannot always be completely trusted. The continuators of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, that is, Rufinus, <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, are not to be compared to <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> himself, for that industrious <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> has fortunately bequeathed to us rather a collection of invaluable materials than a history. His "Life" or rather "Panegyric of Constantine" is less remarkable for its contents than for its politic omissions. <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> found his materials in the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> at <a href="03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, and still more in that left by <a href="01295b.htm">Bishop Alexander</a> at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. He cites earlier collections of documents, the letters of Dionysius of <a href="04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, <a href="05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, Serapion of Antioch, some of the <a href="05509a.htm">epistles</a> sent to <a href="15409a.htm">Pope Victor</a> by councils throughout the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, besides employing earlier writers of history or memoirs such as Papias, Hegesippus, Apollonius, an anonymous opponent of the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, the "Little Labyrinth" of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (?), etc.</p>

<p>The principal additions we can still make to these precious remnants are, first, <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> on the <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>; then the works of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, full of valuable information about the controversies of his own <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> and place and the customs of the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, and containing also some less valuable information about earlier matters &#151; less valuable, because <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> is singularly careless and deficient in historical sense. Next, we possess the correspondence of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, comprising letters of <a href="01199a.htm">African councils</a>, of <a href="04375c.htm">St. Cornelius</a> and others, besides those of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> himself. To all this fragmentary information we can add much from <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, something from <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and also from <a href="12043b.htm">Photius</a> and Byzantine chronographers. The whole Ante-Nicene evidence has been catalogued with wonderful industry by Harnack, with the help of Preuschen and others, in a book of 1021 pages, the first volume of his invaluable "History of Early Christian Literature". In the middle of the fourth century, St. Epiphanius's book on <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> is learned but confused; it is most annoying to think how useful it would have been had its <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> author quoted his authorities by name, as <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> did. As it is, we can with difficulty, if at all, discover whether his sources are to be depended on or not. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> lives of illustrious men are carelessly put together, mainly from <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, but with additional information of great value, where we can trust its accuracy. <a href="06417a.htm">Gennadius of Marseilles</a> continued this work with great profit to us. The Western cataloguers of <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, such as <a href="11797a.htm">Philastrius</a>, Praedestinatus, and <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, are less useful.</p>

<p>Collections of documents are the most important matter of all. In the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversy the collections published by <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> in his <a href="01618a.htm">apologetic</a> works are first-rate authorities. Of those put together by St. Hilary only fragments survive. Another <em>dossier</em> by the Homoiousian Sabinus, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>, was known to <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, and we can trace its use by him. A collection of documents connected with the origins of <a href="05121a.htm">Donatism</a> was made towards the beginning of the fourth century, and was appended by <a href="11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a> to his great work. Unfortunately only a part is preserved; but much of the lost matter is quoted by Optatus and <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>. A pupil of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="09672b.htm">Marius Mercator</a>, happened to be at Constantinople during the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> controversy, and he formed an interesting collection of <em>pi&egrave;ces justificatives</em>. He put together a corresponding set of papers bearing on the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> controversy. <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, amassed documents bearing on Nestorianism, as a <a href="03052b.htm">brief</a> in his own defence. These have been preserved to us in the reply of an opponent, who has added a great number. Another kind of collection is that of letters. St. Isidore's and St. Augustine's are immensely numerous, but bear little upon history. There is far more historical matter in those (for instance) of Ambrose and Jerome, Basil and Chrysostom. Those of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> are numerous, and of first-rate value; and the large collections of them also contain letters addressed to the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. The correspondence of Leo and of <a href="07470a.htm">Hormisdas</a> is very complete. Besides these collections of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> letters and the <a href="04670b.htm">decretals</a>, we have separate collections, of which two are important, the Collectio Avellana, and that of Stephen of Larissa.</p>

<p>Councils supply another great historical source. Those of Nicaea, <a href="13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, Constantinople, have left us no Acts, only some letters and canons. Of the later &oelig;cumenical councils we have not only the detailed Acts, but also numbers of letters connected with them. Many smaller councils have also been preserved in the later collections; those made by Ferrandus of Carthage and Dionysius the Little deserve special mention. In many cases the Acts of one council are preserved by another at which they were read. For example, in 418, a <a href="01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> recited all the canons of former African <a href="12164c.htm">plenary council</a> in the presence of a <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>; the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> embodies all the Acts of the first session of the <a href="05495a.htm">Robber Council of Ephesus</a>, and the Acts of that session contained the Acts of two <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of Constantinople. The later sessions of the <a href="05495a.htm">Robber Council</a> (preserved only in <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a>) contain a number of documents concerning inquiries and trials of <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Much information of various kinds has been derived of late years from <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a> and Coptic sources, and even from the Arabic, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, <a href="11712a.htm">Persian</a>, <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="14041b.htm">Slavonic</a>. It is not necessary to speak here of the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> writings as sources for our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> organization, ecclesiastical geography, <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. canon law and procedure, archaeology, etc. The sources are, however, much the same for all these branches as for <a href="07365a.htm">history</a> proper.</p>

<h2 id="patristic">Patristic study</h2>

<h3 id="A">Editors of the Fathers</h3>

<p>The earliest histories of <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> literature are those contained in <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and in Jerome's <a href="../fathers/2708.htm">"De viris illustribus"</a>. They were followed by <a href="06417a.htm">Gennadius</a>, who continued <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, by <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>, and by <a href="07649b.htm">St. Ildephonsus of Toledo</a>. In the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the best known are <a href="13783c.htm">Sigebert</a> of the <a href="06407c.htm">monastery of Gembloux</a> (d. 1112), and <a href="15062a.htm">Trithemius</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Sponheim and of <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (d. 1516). Between these come an anonymous <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="10167a.htm">Melk</a> (Mellicensis, c. 1135) and <a href="07461a.htm">Honorius of Autun</a> (1122-5). Ancient editors are not wanting; for instance, many anonymous works, like the Pseudo-Clementines and <a href="01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitutions</a>, have been remodelled more than once; the translators of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Jerome, Rufinus, and unknown <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>) cut out, altered, added; <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> published an expurgated edition of Victorinus "On the Apocalypse". <a href="11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> made a list of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen's</a> writings, and Possidius did the same for those of <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>.</p>

<p>The great editions of the Fathers began when printing had become common. One of the earliest editors was <a href="09114b.htm">Faber Stapulensis (Lef&egrave;vre d'Estaples)</a>, whose edition of <a href="05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a> was published in 1498. The <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="11435a.htm">Pam&egrave;le</a> (1536-87) published much. The controversialist <a href="06058a.htm">Feuardent</a>, a <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> (1539-1610) did some good editing. The sixteenth century produced gigantic works of history. The <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="03534b.htm">"Centuriators" of Magdeburg</a> described thirteen centuries in as many volumes (1559-74). <a href="02304b.htm">Cardinal Baronius</a> (1538-1607) replied with his famous "Annales Ecclesiastici", reaching to the year 1198 (12 vols., 1588-1607). <a href="02566a.htm">Marguerin de la Bigne</a>, a doctor of the Sorbonne (1546-89), published his "Bibliotheca veterum Patrum" (9 vols., 1577-9) to assist in refuting the <a href="03534b.htm">Centuriators</a>.</p>

<p>The great <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> editors were almost in the seventeenth century; <a href="07029b.htm">Gretserus</a> (1562-1625), <a href="05181a.htm">Fronto Ducaeus</a> (Fronton du Duc, 1558-1624), Andreas Schott (1552-1629), were diligent editors of the <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> Fathers. The celebrated <a href="14027c.htm">Sirmond</a> (1559-1651) continued to publish <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> Fathers and councils and much else, from the age of 51 to 92. <a href="11743a.htm">Denis P&eacute;tau</a> (Petavius, 1583-1652) edited <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> Fathers, wrote on <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a>, and produced an incomparable book of historical <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, "De theologicis dogmatibus" (1044). To these may be added the ascetic Halloix (1572-1656), the uncritical Chifflet (1592-1682), and <a href="06388c.htm">Jean Garnier</a>, the historian of the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> (d. 1681). The greatest work of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> is the publication of the "Acta Sanctorum", which has now reached the beginning of November, in 64 volumes. It was planned by Rosweyde (1570-1629) as a large collection of lives of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>; but the founder of the work as we have it is the famous John van Bolland (1596-1665). He was joined in 1643 by <a href="07240a.htm">Henschenius</a> and Papebrochius (1628-1714), and thus the <a href="02630a.htm">Society of Bollandists</a> began, and continued, in spite of the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a>, until the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, 1794. It was happily revived in 1836 (see <a href="02630a.htm">B<font size=-2>OLLANDISTS</font></a>). Other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> editors were Gerhard Voss (d. 1609), Albaspinaeus (De l'Aubespine, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, 1579-1630), Rigault (1577-1654), and the Sorbonne doctor <a href="04421b.htm">Cotelier</a> (1629-86). The <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Comb&eacute;fis (1605-79) edited <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> Fathers, added two volumes to <a href="02566a.htm">de la Bigne's</a> collection, and made collections of <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>. The <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> Valesius (de Valois, 1603-70) was of great eminence.</p>

<p>Among <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> may be mentioned the controversialist Clericus (Le Clerc, 1657-1736); Bishop Fell of Oxford (1625-86), the editor of <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, with whom must be classed Bishop Pearson and Dodwell; Grabe (1666-1711), a <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> who settled in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> Basnage (1653-1723). The famous Gallican <a href="02242a.htm">Etienne Baluze</a> (1630-1718), was an editor of great industry. The Proven&ccedil;al <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Pagi, published an invaluable commentary on <a href="02304b.htm">Baronius</a> in 1689-1705. But the greatest historical achievement was that of a <a href="13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, <a href="14724b.htm">Louis Le Nain de Tillemont</a>, whose "Histoire des Empereurs" (6 vols., 1690) and "M&eacute;moires pour servir &agrave; l'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique des six premiers si&egrave;cles" (16 vols., 1693) have never been superseded or equalled. Other historians are <a href="11103a.htm">Cardinal H. Noris</a> (1631-1704); <a href="01296c.htm">Natalis Alexander</a> (1639-1725), a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>; <a href="06102c.htm">Fleury</a> (in French, 1690-1719). To these must be added the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Archbishop Ussher of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a> (1580-1656), and many canonists, such as <a href="05541b.htm">Van Espen</a>, Du Pin, La Marca, and <a href="09436c.htm">Christianus Lupus</a>. The Oratorian <a href="14697c.htm">Thomassin</a> wrote on <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquities (1619-95); the English Bingham composed a great work on the same subject (1708-22). Holstein (1596-1661), a <a href="04347a.htm">convert</a> from <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, was librarian at the <a href="15276b.htm">Vatican</a>, and published collections of documents. The Oratorian <a href="10570b.htm">J. Morin</a> (1597-1659) published a famous work on the history of <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and a confused one on that of penance. The chief <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> among <a href="01498a.htm">English Protestants</a> is Bishop Bull, who wrote a reply to <a href="11743a.htm">Petavius's</a> views on the development of <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, entitled "Defensio fidei Nicaenae" (1685). The Greek <a href="01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a> (1586-1669), <a href="04577a.htm">custos</a> of the <a href="15276b.htm">Vatican</a> <a href="09227b.htm">Library</a>, was almost a second <a href="02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>. He wrote on <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> and on the ecclesiastical books of the Greeks. A century later the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a> <a href="01794a.htm">J.S. Assemani</a> (1687-1768) published amongst other works a "Bibliotheca Orientalis" and an edition of Ephrem Syrus. His nephew edited an immense collection of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. The chief liturgiologist of the seventeenth century is the <a href="06573a.htm">Blessed Cardinal Tommasi</a>, a <a href="14557a.htm">Theatine</a> (1649-1713, <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> 1803), the type of a saintly savant.</p>

<p>The great <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> form a group by themselves, for (apart from <a href="03189a.htm">Dom Calmet</a>, a Biblical scholar, and <a href="03476b.htm">Dom Ceillier</a>, who belonged to the Congregation of St-Vannes) all were of the Congregation of St-Maur, the learned men of which were drafted into the <a href="01010a.htm">Abbey</a> of St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. <a href="01102a.htm">Dom Luc d'Ach&eacute;ry</a> (1605-85) is the founder ("Spicilegium", 13 vols.); <a href="09479b.htm">Dom Mabillon</a> (1632-1707) is the greatest name, but he was mainly occupied with the early <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="10539b.htm">Bernard de Montfaucon</a> (1655-1741) has almost equal fame (Athanasius, <a href="07316a.htm">Hexapla</a> of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Chrysostom, Antiquities, <a href="11403a.htm">Palaeography</a>). <a href="04454a.htm">Dom Coustant</a> (1654-1721) was the principal collaborator, it seems, in the great edition of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (1679-1700; also letters of the <a href="12260a.htm">Popes</a>, Hilary). <a href="06384b.htm">Dom Garet</a> (Cassiodorus, 1679), Du Friche (<a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, 1686-90), <a href="09722b.htm">Martianay</a> (St. Jerome, 1693-1706, less successful), Delarue (<a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, 1733-59), <a href="09636a.htm">Maran</a> (with Tout&eacute;e, <a href="04595b.htm">Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, 1720; alone, the <a href="01618a.htm">Apologists</a>, 1742; <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory Nazianzen</a>, unfinished), <a href="10037b.htm">Massuet</a> (<a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, 1710), Ste-Marthe (<a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, 1705), <a href="06389a.htm">Julien Garnier</a> (St. Basil, 1721-2), Ruinart (Acta Martyrum sincera, 1689, <a href="15415a.htm">Victor Vitensis</a>, 1694, and <a href="07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> and <a href="06251c.htm">Fredegar</a>, 1699), are all well-known names. The works of <a href="09721a.htm">Mart&egrave;ne</a> (1654-1739) on <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="13064b.htm">rites</a> (1690 and 1700-2) and his collections of anecdota (1700, 1717, and 1724-33) are most voluminous; he was assisted by Durand. The great historical works of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of St-Maur need not be mentioned here, but Dom Sabatier's edition of the Old Latin Bible, and the new editions of <a href="05181b.htm">Du Cange's</a> <a href="06588a.htm">glossaries</a> must be noted. For the great editors of collections of councils see under the names mentioned in the bibliography of the article on <a href="04423f.htm">C<font size=-2>OUNCILS</font></a>.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century may be noted Archbishop Potter (1674-1747, <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>). At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="01701e.htm">Ar&eacute;valo</a> (<a href="08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a>, 1797-1803); <a href="06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, a <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Oratorian (Bibliotheca veterum Patrum, 1765-81). The Veronese scholars form a remarkable group. The historian <a href="16058b.htm">Maffei</a> (for our purpose his "anecdota of <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>" are to be noted, 1702), <a href="15260a.htm">Vallarsi</a> (St. Jerome, 1734-42, a great work, and Rufinus, 1745), the <a href="02223b.htm">brothers Ballerini</a> (<a href="15754d.htm">St. Zeno</a>, 1739; St. Leo, 1753-7, a most remarkable production), not to speak of <a href="02541b.htm">Bianchini</a>, who published <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a> of the Old Latin Gospels, and the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, who re-edited <a href="02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, <a href="05745a.htm">Fabricius</a>, <a href="14697c.htm">Thomassinus</a>, <a href="02242a.htm">Baluze</a>, etc., as well as the "Collectio Amplissima" of councils. A general conspectus shows us the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> taking the lead c. 1590-1650, and the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> working about 1680-1750. The French are always in the first place. There are some sparse names of eminence in <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; a few in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> takes the lead in the second half of the eighteenth century. The great literary histories of <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, <a href="05745a.htm">Fabricius</a>, Du Pin, Cave, Oudin, <a href="13590b.htm">Schram</a>, <a href="09431b.htm">Lumper</a>, <a href="14463c.htm">Ziegelbauer</a>, and Schoenemann will be found below in the bibliography. The first half of the nineteenth century was singularly barren of <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> study; nevertheless there were marks of the commencement of the new era in which <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> takes the head. The second half of the nineteenth was exceptionally and increasingly prolific. It is impossible to enumerate the chief editors and critics. New <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> was poured forth by <a href="09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai</a> (1782-1854) and <a href="12119b.htm">Cardinal Pitra</a> (1812-89), both prefects of the <a href="15276b.htm">Vatican</a> <a href="09227b.htm">Library</a>. Inedita in such quantities seem to be found no more, but isolated discoveries have come frequently and still come; Eastern <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a>, such as those of <a href="02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> and <a href="11547a.htm">Patmos</a>, Constantinople, and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and <a href="14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, have yielded unknown treasures, while the <a href="14408a.htm">Syriac</a>, Coptic, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, etc., have supplied many losses supposed to be irrecoverable. The sands of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have given something, but not much, to <a href="11560a.htm">patrology</a>.</p>

<p>The greatest boon in the way of editing has been the two great patrologies of the <a href="10290a.htm">Abb&eacute; Migne</a> (1800-75). This energetic man put the works of all the Greek and <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> Fathers within easy reach by the "Patrologia Latina" (222 vols., including 4 vols. of indexes) and the "Patrologia Graeca" (161 vols). The Ateliers Catholiques which he founded produced <a href="15698b.htm">wood-carving</a>, pictures, <a href="11297a.htm">organs</a>, etc., but printing was the special work. The workshops were destroyed by a disastrous fire in 1868, and the recommencement of the work was made impossible by the Franco-German <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>. The "Monumenta Germaniae", begun by the <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a> librarian Pertz, was continued with vigour under the most celebrated scholar of the century, Theodor Mommsen. Small collections of <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> works are catalogued below. A new edition of the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> Fathers was undertaken in the sixties by the Academy of Vienna. The volumes published up till now have been uniformly creditable works which call up no particular enthusiasm. At the present rate of progress some centuries will be needed for the great work. The Berlin Academy has commenced a more modest task, the re-editing of the Greek Ante-Nicene writers, and the energy of Adolf Harnack is ensuring rapid publication and real success. The same indefatigable student, with von Gebhardt, edits a series of "Texte und Untersuchungen", which have for a part of their object to be the <a href="11297a.htm">organ</a> of the <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a> editors of the Fathers. The series contains many valuable studies, with much that would hardly have been published in other countries.</p>

<p>The Cambridge series of "Texts and Studies" is younger and proceeds more slowly, but keeps at a rather higher level. There should be mentioned also the Italian "Studii e Testi", in which Mercati and Pio Franchi de' Cavalieri collaborate. In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, in spite of the slight revival of interest in <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> studies <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> by the <a href="11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>, the amount of work has not been great. For learning perhaps <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> is really first in the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions. As critics the Cambridge School, Westcott, Hort, and above all Lightfoot, are second to none. But the amount edited has been very small, and the excellent "Dictionary of Christian Biography" is the only great work published. Until 1898 there was absolutely no <a href="11297a.htm">organ</a> for <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> studies, and the "Journal of Theological Studies" founded in that year would have found it difficult to survive financially without the help of the Oxford University Press. But there has been an increase of interest in these subjects of late years, both among <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> has lately been coming once more to the fore, and is very nearly level with <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> even in output. In the last fifty years, archaeology has added much to <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> studies; in this sphere the greatest name is that of <a href="04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>.</p>

Ecclesia Patrum</em> (133 vols. em. 8vo, Paris, 1829-42); GERSDORF, <em>Bibl. Patrum eccl. lat. selecta</em> (13 vols., Leipzig, 1838-47); the Oxford <em>Bibliotheca Patrum</em> reached 10 vols. (Oxford, 1838-55); PITRA, <em>Spicilegium Solesmense</em> (4 vols. 4to, Paris, 1852-8). The number of these various collections, in addition to the works of the great Fathers, made it difficult to obtain a complete set of patristic writings. MIGNE supplied the want by collecting almost all the foregoing (except the end of the last mentioned work, and Mais later volumes) into his complete editions: <em>Patrologiae cursus completus, Series latine</em> (to Innocent III, A.D. 1300, 221 vols. 4to, including four vols. of indexes, 1844-55), <em>Series graeco-latine</em> (to the Council of Florence, A.D. 1438-9, 161 vols. 4to, 1857-66, and another rare vol. of additions, 1866); the <em>Series graece</em> was also published, in Latin only, in 81 vols.; there is no index in the Series grace; an alphabetical list of contents by SCHOLAREOS (Athens, 1879, useful); other publications, not included in Migne, by PITRA, are <em>Juris ecclesiastici Graecarum hist. et monum.</em> (2 vols., Rome, 1864-8); <em>Analecta sacra</em> (6 vols., numbered I, II, III, IV, VI, VIII, Paris, 1876-84); <em>Analecta sacra et classica</em> (Paris, 1888); <em>Analecta novissima</em>, medieval (2 vols., 1885-8); the new edition of Latin Fathers is called <em>Corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum latinorum, editum consilio et impensis Academiae litterarum Caesarea Vindobonensis</em> (Vienna, 1866, 8vo, in progress); and of the Greek Fathers: <em>Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderten, herausgegeben von der Kirchenv&auml;tter-Kommission den K&ouml;nigl. preussiechen Akad. den Wise</em>. (Berlin, 1897, large 8vo, in progress). Of the <em>Monumenta Germaniae historica</em>, one portion, the <em>Auctores antiquissimi</em> (Berlin, 1877-98), contains works of the sixth century which connect themselves with patrology. Small modern collections are HURTER, <em>SS. Patrum opuscula selecta</em>, with a few good notes (Innebruck, 1st series, 48 vols., 1868-85, 2nd series, 6 vols. 1884-92) &#151; these little books have been deservedly popular; KR&Uuml;GER, <em>Semmlung ausgew&auml;hlter kirchen- und dogmengeschichtlicher Quellenechriften</em> (Freiburg, 1891-); RAUSCHEN, <em>Florilegium patristicum</em>, of first and second centuries (3 fasc., Bonn, 1904-5); <em>Cambridge patristic texts</em> (I, <em>The Five Theol.

German Catholic works are: GOLDWITZER, <em>Bibliographie der Kirchenv&auml;ter und Kirchenlehrer</em> (Landshut, 1828); IDEM, <em>Patrologie verbunden mi Patristik</em> (Nuremberg, 1833-4); the older distinction in Germany between patrology, the knowledge of the Fathers and their use, and patristic, the science of the theology of the Fathers, is now somewhat antiquated; BUSSE, <em>Grundriss der chr.

Dupin, Paris, 1730), and Du Pin's work was put on the Index in 1757; FABACCEUS, <em>Bibliotheca Graece, sive edititia Scriptorum veterum Graecorum</em> (Hamburg, 1705-28, 14 vols.; new ed. by HARLES, Hamburg, 1790-1809, 12 vols., embraces not quite 11 vole, of the original ed.; index to this ed., Leipzig, 1838) &#151; this great work is really a vast collection of materials; Fabricius was a Protestant (d. 1736); he made a smaller collection of the Latin lit. hist., <em>Bibl. Latina, sive non. scr. vett, latt.</em> (1697, 1708, 1712, etc., ed. by ERNESTI, 3 vols., Leipzig, 1773-4), and a continuation for the Middle Ages (1734-6, 5 vols.); the whole was re-edited by MANSI (6 vols., Padua, 1754, and Florence, 1858-9); LE NOURRY, <em>Apparatus ad Biblioth. Max. vett. Patr.</em> (2 vols. fol., Paris, 1703-15), deals with Greek Fathers of the second century and with Latin apologists; CEILLIER, <em>Hist. g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des auteurs sacr&eacute;s et eccl&eacute;s.</em> (from Moses to 1248, 23 vols., Paris, 1729-63; <em>Table g&eacute;n. des Met.</em>, by RONDET, Paris, 1782; new ed. 16 vols., Paris, 1858-69); SCHRAM, <em>Analysis Operum SS. PP. et Scriptorum eccles.</em> (Vienna, 1780-96, 18 vols., a valuable work); LUMPER, <em>Hist. Theologico-critica de vit&acirc; scriptis atque doctrina SS. PP. at scr. eccl. trium primorum saec.</em> (Vienna, 1783-99, 13 vols.; a compilation, but good); the Anglican CAVE published a fine work, <em>Scriptorum eccl. historia literaria</em> (London, 1688; best ed., Oxford, 1740-3); OUDIN, a Premonstratensian, who became a Protestant, <em>Commentarius de Scriptoribus eccl.</em> (founded on Bellarmine, 3 vols. fol., Leipzig, 1722). On the editions of the Latin Fathers, SCHOENEMANN, <em>Bibliotheca historico-litteraria Patrum Latinorum a Tert, ad Greg. M. at Isid. Hisp.</em> (2 vols., Leipzig, 1792-4).</p><p class="cenotes">HISTORIES OF THE FATHERS:-- It is unnecessary to catalogue here all the general histories of the Church, large and small, from Baronius onwards; it will be sufficient to give some of those which deal specially with the Fathers and with ecclesiastical literature. The first and chief is the incomparable work of TILLEMONT, <em>M&eacute;moires pour servir &agrave; l'histoire eccl. des six premiers si&egrave;cles</em> (Paris, 1693-1712, 16 vols., and other editions); MAR&Eacute;CHAL, <em>Concordance des SS.

Litt, bis Eusebius, I, Die Ueberlieferung</em> (Leipzig, 1893; this vol. enumerates all the known works of each writer, and all ancient references to them, and notices the MSS.); II, 1 (1897), and II, 2 (1904), <em>Die Chronologie</em>, discussing the date of each writing; the latter Greek period is dealt with by KRUMBACHER, <em>Geschichte der byzantinischen Litt.</em> 527-1453 (2nd ed. with assistance from EHRHARD, Munich, 1897). The following collected series of studies must be added: <em>Textd und Untersuschungen zur Geschichte der altchristlichen Litt.</em>, ed. VON GEBHARDT AND A.

G.</em> (Halle, 1889; 3rd ed., 1893); SEEBERG, <em>Lehrb. der D. G.</em> (2 vols., Erlangen, 1895), conservative Protestant; IDEM, <em>Grundriss der D.
