<p>An <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> statesman and <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; b. at <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 5 April, 1801; d. at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 26 October, 1852. When still very young he lost his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> and at the age of sixteen he was admitted among the <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the court, he studied <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> University, and obtained there the doctorate; he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1825 and appointed court <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and professor in the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> college. In 1828 he made a journey through <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, and became friendly with <a href="09634a.htm">Manzoni</a> and other great men. He caused <a href="13194b.htm">Rosmini's</a> philosophy to be known in <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, though at a later date he became its opponent. At this time under the pen-name "Demofilo" he was writing articles in Mazzini's "Giovane Italia", printed at <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. In 1833 he resigned his court chaplaincy, and soon after was arrested on suspicion of political intrigues. Nothing could be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> against him, but he was expelled from the country and went to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he made many friends. He now ceased contributing to the "Giovane Italia" and Cousin offered him a chair of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> on condition that he would not oppose Cousin's own <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system. Though financially in very straitened circumstances, Gioberti refused the offer. He then accepted an offer to teach <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in a private <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a> conducted by an Italian. During his stay in <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a> most of his works where published.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1841, on the appearance of his book "Del Buono", the Grand Duke of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> offered him a chair in the <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> University, but King Charles Albert objected, and the offer came to nothing. His fame in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> dates from 1843 when he published his "Del primato morale e civile degli Italiani", which he dedicated to <a href="11609b.htm">Silvio Pellico</a>. Starting with the greatness of ancient <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he traced history down through the splendours of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and recounting all that <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> and art owed to the genius of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he declared that the Italian people were a model for all nations, and that their then insignificance was the result of their weakness politically, to remedy which he proposed a confederation of all the states of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as their head. It is curious that in this work he is very severe on the French, yet he has not a word to say about the Austrians who then occupied <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> territory. Pope and prince received the work very coldly, and a few <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> wrote against it. In 1845 he was once more in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and published the "Prolegomeni al Primato", in which he attacked the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; and in 1847 he printed "II Gesuita Moderno", a large sized pamphlet, full of vulgar invective, in 1848 this was followed by an "Apologia del Gesuita Moderno". These works were answered in 1849 by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Curci's "Divinazione sulle tre ultime opere di V. Gioberti". Early in 1848, when <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was burning with hopes of liberty and independence, Gioberti returned to his native land and was joyously received by his fellow-townsmen. Soon afterwards he went to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> to calm the over-impetuous and to oppose Mazzini; from there he visited King Charles Albert at Sommacampagna. He received a mission for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and on his arrival his reception was so enthusiastic that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> became alarmed. On his return from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the king wanted to appoint him senator of the kingdom, but Gioberti preferred to be elected as deputy; he became president of the Chamber and, in July, he joined the Collegno cabinet. After the unfortunate Salasco armistice he broke up the cabinet, declared for a continuation of the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and bitterly assailed the Revel ministry. He next founded a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> to propagate the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a federated <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, with the King of <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> and not the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at its head. In December he became president of the ministry (with Rattazzi and other democrats) whereas the new cabinet was all for <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, Giobertl had learned caution, and was anxious to reorganize the army. Moreover, he wanted <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> to re-establish in their estates the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Grand Duke of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, who had been driven out by the revolution; so he quarrelled with his fellow-ministers and resigned on 20 February, 1849, but in the newspapers he carried on the quarrel. After the disastrous battle of <a href="11134b.htm">Novara</a> (23 March, 1849), Victor Emmanuel II offered him a portfolio; he agreed to join the ministry but would not take a portfolio. He was then sent as plenipotentiary minister to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> to solicit French aid in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He was unsuccessful, and finding he was out of favour at <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> he resigned his post, but remained in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where, after three years passed in study, he died. In 1851 he published his "Rinnovamento civile d' Italia" which contains an impassioned criticism of political events from 1848 onwards. This last book, while it clings to the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a federated <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, shows that Gioberti was a republican and that he hoped the loss of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> temporal power would bring about the religious renovation of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Thereupon all his works were put on the Index. His closing years were embittered by seeing his hopes shattered, and this bitterness finds an echo in his works.</p>

<p>Gioberti's philosophy is a mixture of <a href="11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> ontologism with <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a> and traditionalism. The ontologism of <a href="09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>, as modified by <a href="06471b.htm">Cardinal Gerdil</a>, had been taught him at the <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> University. His first principle is that the <em>primum cognitum</em> of the human <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> or being; i.e. absolute and eternal <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> as far as "human <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a>" can grasp it is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. "Being" he calls the <em>primum philosophicum</em>, because in the <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> order it is the <em>primum psychologicum</em>, and in the order of existing things it is the <em>primum ontologicum</em>; it is the common foundation of all reality and all <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. <a href="03432a.htm">Intuition</a> of being embraces the judgment, "being exists or is necessarily", which is not the result of any <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> process, but is the spontaneous effect produced when being presents itself to the mind. But in being we merely see its relative attributes, not its essence, we remains unknown (the superintelligible) and is the object of <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="12738a.htm">religion</a>. Among these relative attributes is comprised the creative act, by <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> of which, in being, we arrive at a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of its results, namely, contingent things, and thus establish the <em>formula idealis</em>, "being creates existing things", <em>ens creat existentias</em>. This judgment is synthetical <em>a priori</em>, not in the <a href="08603a.htm">Kantian</a> sense, but by "objective synthesis" resulting from the revelation of being. However, <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> of the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> remains too indeterminate, and hence the necessity of speech which so circumscribes the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that we can contemplate or re-think it (this is pure traditionalism).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>His theory of creation is the most important part of his system and requires a longer explanation. He calls the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> also the <em>Esse Universale</em>, which is common to and identical in all things, and which is nothing more or less than their possibility itself. Before the creation <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> (being, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>) is <em>universalis</em> and abstract. It becomes concrete by its own act, individuating itself, making itself finite, and multifying itself. "To create is therefore to individuate". In this process the intelligible that was absolute becomes relative; there are two cycles to the process, one descending, inasmuch as the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> infringes on the concrete (<em>mimesis</em>), and other ascending, it reaches out more and more towards the intelligible absolute (<em>methexis</em>), and participates of the Divine Being (this is pure <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a>). Thus he arrives at the conclusion that in the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> order the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of created things are so many steps in the scale of the Divine Essence. And as regards creation, he adopts the saying of <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel</a> that "logic . . . is nothing but creation". From all this, Gioberti's <a href="11447b.htm">pantheism</a> is evident. No <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> he is always asserting that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> was distinct from His creatures; but the sincerity of these statements is not beyond question. As a matter of fact, after his separation from the Mazzinians they published a letter of his to the "Giovane Italia" in which he expressly stated that <a href="11447b.htm">pantheism</a> is the only <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> and sound philosophy". His theory of mimesis and methexis is also used to prove the <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. Then again the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of being is made the foundation of moral <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> as a binding force, and, inasmuch as it approves or disapproves, we have the concepts of merit and demerit. The aim of the moral law is to bring to pass the perfect union of existences and being, in other words to complete the methexic cycle. Man endowed with freedom can approach or keep away from being; hence the origin of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>; and when such aversion from being is endless it becomes <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> and immanent. Later, however, recognizing that this would be an exception to the "logical" law of methexis, he denied this eternal immanence of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that, in politics, he denied the sovereignty of the people. In Gioberti's theory the object of religion is the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> and the superintelligible, which meant according to him the essence of being revealed by means of speech. On the other hand he treats at length of the harmony between religion and <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> or civilization. But as a rule all his vague theorizing was tinged with <a href="12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, and even in his latest works he writes: "science and civilization must go on throwing light on what is supernatural and superintelligible in religion", and again, "modern <a href="12652a.htm">rationalism</a> is destined to bring about the union of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>". His <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works are: "Teorica del sovrannaturale" (1838; 2nd ed., with replies to critics, 1850); "Introduzione allo studio della filosofia" (1840); "Lettere sugli errori politico-religiosi di Lamennais" (1840); "Del Bello" and "Del Buono" (1841); "Errori filosofici di Antonio Rosmini." (1842). Mention should also be made of his posthumous works: "Riforma Cattolica"; "Filosofia della Rivelazione"; "Protologia". His complete works in thirty-five volumes were published at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, in 1877.</p>
