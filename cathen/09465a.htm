<p>The small remnant of the old duchy of this name and since 11 May, 1867, an independent neutral grand duchy, comprising 998 sq. miles of territory, lying principally between 49&#176; 27&#180; and 50&#176; 12&#180; N. lat., and 5&#176; 45&#180; and 6&#176; 32&#180; E. long.</p>

<p>It is bounded by <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> on the west, <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> on the east, <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> and (for a short distance) <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> on the south. It is well wooded, having over 190 sq. miles of forest, and well watered (Moselle, Sure, Our, and Alzett, the first two being navigable to a greater or less extent); it is situated at an elevation of about 1000 feet above the sea level, is mountainous and possesses a temperate healthy climate. The arable lands, including almost half the country, yield abundant crops of grain, and splendid pastures feed numerous herds of cattle and horses. The vine produces annually more than 1,300,000 gallons of wine and the fruit harvest is no less generous. There is an inexhaustible supply of fine building-stone. Especially important are the extensive beds of excellent iron ore (10,000 acres), which are extensively worked. Trades and industries flourish, thanks to the network of roads and railways. The population, which numbers about 250,000 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, is almost entirely of Germanic origin and a dialect is in use which suggests the German of the Palatinate. In one or two districts only Walloon is spoken. In administration and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, French predominates. In the churches and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, sermons and instructions are given in High German.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Almost all of Luxemburg is <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Only in the capital city and in the industrial centres (Esch, Dudelingen, Differdingen, Rodingen, Rimmelingen) there are <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> communities whose entire membership scarcely numbers 3000. Nevertheless they enjoy the same <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> as the hundred-times more numerous native inhabitants. Of <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> there are only about 1200, but their number is increasing. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have had a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of their own to preside over them since 1870 (officially recognized in 1873). Originally Luxemburg belonged to various sees (Trier, Li&#232;ge, <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, Cologne), from 1795 to 1801 it belonged to <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, then to Namur. From 1840-70 it was a <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>; in that year it was raised to the dignity of a <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> being Nicholas Adames. Since 1883 his successor Joseph Koppes has been assisted by a chapter of nine dignitaries (<a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a> and eight canons) in the administration of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The former <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church of Our Blessed Lady in the city of Luxemburg is the present <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Parochial <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> are performed by 260 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> with 200 additional <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> assisted by <a href="12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of different orders.</p>

<p>The diocese also possesses several institutions for the sick and for <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> purposes, and for those preparing to enter the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> there is a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in the capital. For higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> there is in the same city a flourishing athen&aelig;um in which the more advanced classes give the usual <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> instruction; gymnasia and similar institutions exist in Diekirch, Echternach, etc. Common <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> has been <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> since 1881. The <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> (700, with 32,000 children) are non-sectarian and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are allowed merely to give religious instruction. Children may begin their secondary <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> only at the age of twelve years. The line which in most states divides the <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> from the non-educated has been in this way bridged over, and social distinctions are less marked in Luxemburg than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organizations we will mention here only the Bonifatius-Verein, which since its establishment in 1850 has collected 200,000 marks which has been almost entirely handed over to German mission stations. The <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the people have been upheld (since 1847) by the splendidly conducted journal "Luxemburger Wort". Among the lesser newspapers the "Moselzeitung" which appears in Gravenmacher, has a large circulation. The editors of the well-known periodicals "Stimmen aus Maria Laach" and "Die Katholischen Missionen" (Fathers Frick and Huonder, S.J.) direct them from Luxemburg.</p>

<p>The grand duchy is a constitutional monarchy, the sovereignty being vested in the House of Nassau, the so-called Walramic line, according to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of primogeniture. As the present grand duke, William, has no son by his marriage with Maria Anna of Braganza, the crown will revert on his death (according to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of 1907) to his eldest daughter, who like her sisters belongs to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The parliament consists of 51 members elected for six years, part of which is chosen every three years. The Government consists of a president (minister) and three directors general, and is responsible to the Chamber, but submits bills only after obtaining the opinions of fifteen councillors of state, named by the reigning prince. The country is divided into three administrative districts, twelve cantons, and 130 communes. Justice is administered by a supreme court, two circuit courts and a criminal court in every canton. The armed force (one company of volunteers, one company of gendarmes) is concerned merely with the maintenance of order. The financial system (modelled on the French both as to the <a href="11152a.htm">coins</a> and the weights and measures) is in flourishing <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a>. The national <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> is small. Receipts and expenditures balance, so that there is no lack of means for promotion of culture. The national colours are red, white, and blue. There are several orders, the most widely distributed being the Order of the Crown of Oak (5 classes, 2 medals). The capital of the grand duchy, also called Luxemburg, is very ancient, and was formerly strongly fortified, but is now dismantled, and beautifully laid out. It is rich in fine <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular buildings (churches, castles, government buildings, etc.), as well as in scientific institutions and industrial plants. It has over 25,000 inhabitants. Among the other towns that of Echternach is interesting for its primitive basilica, which contains the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Frisian apostle, <a href="15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>. The procession that takes place annually is unique and is the last of the "Springing processions", the origins of which seems <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The first written account of this country and people is found in the fifth book of C&aelig;sar's "Commentarii de Bello Gallico". On the Lower Moselle and its tributaries dwelt at that time (53 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) the powerful race of the Treviri, who, in alliance with the people under their protection (for example the Eburones under Ambiorix), at first gave the Romans great trouble, but they were soon compelled to yield to superior numbers and gradually attained the highest civilization. Under <a href="04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> (323-337) <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> (<em>Augusta Trevirorum</em>) became the capital of the province Belgica prima, and later the residence of the prefects of Gaul. The <a href="03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> was introduced at a very early period. Since 316 the town was the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. As more than half of the subsequent Duchy of Lorraine belonged for centuries to the <a href="15042a.htm">Diocese of Trier</a>, it is a <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> conclusion that the Christianization of the Ardennes proceeded principally from there. During the Germanic migration the north-eastern provinces of the Roman Empire suffered greatly. Devastated and depopulated, they were occupied by the victorious <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>. In the division of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> empire (843) the provinces in question fell to the share of the Emperor Lothair. In the middle of the tenth century (963?) the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> lord, Siegfried, who held rich possessions in the Forest of Ardennes, acquired the Castellum Lucilini (supposed to have been built by the Romans) with the lands in its vicinity, and styled himself Graf von L&uuml;tzelburg. From the marriage of this great and good man descended Empress Saint Cunigunde, wife of Henry II, the Saint.</p>

<p>The last of Siegfried's male descendents, Conrad II, died about 1126. His dominions passed first to the counts of <a href="10679a.htm">Namur</a> and subsequently to Ermesinde, who reigned from 1196 to 1247. She was especially noted for the impulse she gave to <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> by the foundation of <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Her son and successor, Henry V (1247-81), showed the influence of his noble mother. He took part in Saint Louis's <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against <a href="15088a.htm">Tunis</a>. His successor, Henry VI, remained until nearly 1288 at <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> near Woringen. His wife, Beatrice, had borne him two sons, both of whom attained the highest honours and excellence: Baldwin, afterwards <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and Henry, who obtained the Roman imperial crown as Henry VII (1309). The advancement of the reigning <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> brought no advantage to the country, as the counts wandered farther and farther from home, and concerned themselves only with the affairs of the Empire or the <a href="02612b.htm">Kingdom of Bohemia</a>. They endeavoured to compensate for this in a measure by raising Luxemburg to a duchy, but could not prevent part of it from crumbling away and the whole (1444) falling to <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> by conquest. From the House of Valois, which became extinct on the death of Charles the Bold, in 1477, the country passed to <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and was subject to the Spanish Habsburgs (1556-1714); then to the German Habsburgs (1714-95), and finally to the French (until 1814). The last rule was attended with pernicious results, especially as regards religion and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, the brutalities of the French to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and her servants left sad memories. Even the worship of the goddess of reason prevailed for a time in place of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion.</p>

<p>After the overthrow of <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, better times began for Luxemburg. The Congress of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> decided that as an appendage of the newly created Kingdom of the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> with the rank of grand duchy, it should become a part of the German Confederation. The <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> revolution of 1830 soon exercised a momentous influence on the territorial stability of the country. The entire western (Walloon) part (larger in extent, but more sparsely populated and less fertile than the remainder) was separated from the German Confederation and annexed to the new <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Kingdom. The King of <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> established a regency in the part which remained to him (only under personal union) and in 1842 as Lord of Luxemburg joined the German <em>Zollverein</em>. Until 1866 the country enjoyed quiet and increasing prosperity. The garrisoning of the city and castle of Luxemburg by <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> troops for the first time introduced <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> into the grand duchy. After the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> victories in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> (1866) and the foundation of the North German Confederation, Luxemburg was drawn into the political whirlpool. <a href="10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> thought of annexing the little country and the King of <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> declared himself ready to discuss the matter. Even Bismarck favoured the plan. But when the German nation declared unanimously against it, and the danger of a Franco-German <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> became imminent, the great powers interfered and regulated the "Luxemburg question" at a conference assembled in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, which decreed that the fortress of Luxemburg should be abandoned and dismantled and the "country declared neutral and under the protection of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>". Luxemburg, however, remained a member of the German <em>Zollverein</em>. On the death of William III of <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, Luxemburg passed, as the result of a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> agreement made by the two Nassovian houses in 1783, to the Nassau Walram branch. The old Duke of Nassau, Adolf, who had been deposed in 1866 by <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, assumed the regency on 23 November, 1890, as grand duke. It has been settled in detail that in case his son and successor leaves no male heir, the crown will descend to the eldest daughter.</p>
