<p>(Detroitensis)</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> established 8 March, 1838, comprises the counties of the lower peninsula of the <a href="10280a.htm">State of Michigan</a>, <a href="15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> south of the Counties of Ottawa, Kent, Montcalm, Gratiot, and Saginaw, and east of the Counties of Saginaw and Bay; an area of 18,558 miles. Suffragan of <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>.</p>

<p>To the <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> Father <a href="08420b.htm">Isaac Jogues</a> and his fellow <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Charles Raynbaut, belongs the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of planting the Cross in Michigan when, in 1642, they began their mission to the <a href="10512b.htm">Chippeways</a> of the Sault Ste. Marie. Father Ren&eacute; Menard, also a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, followed them in 1660, and was <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> the next year by a band of prowling savages. His death did not deter others of his brethren in the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> from hastening to this field of labour, and we find <a href="01326b.htm">Father Claude Allouez</a>, at Chegoimegon, 1 October, 1665, preaching to the Ottawas and <a href="07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, and with him these other missionaries: Fathers <a href="04601a.htm">Claude Dablon</a>, Louis Andr&eacute;, <a href="05164a.htm">Gabriel Druilletes</a>, and the famous Jacques Marquette. The last, in 1671, began at Michilimackinaw, his mission of St. Ignatius, where the first <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> for white men in Michigan was established. <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> took formal possession of the West in 1671, but <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> entering the field to dispute for the mastery, political intrigue followed, to the disaster of the old missions among the Indians. Fort St. Joseph, established at Detroit in 1688, developed into the post established there in 1700 by La Mothe Cadillac, who brought with him a number of <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>. This mission was served by the Recollects and under the pastorate of the Rev. Nicholas Benedict Constantin de l'Halle, on 26 July, 1701, the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Anne was dedicated. This is the mother-church of the Northwest, and the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> records are preserved in an unbroken series in the archives of the St. Anne's Church of the present, the building being the sixth of the name in the line of succession. The first entry in this registry is that of the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of a child of Cadillac, the founder of the colony. It is asserted that no other <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> can present a similar record. This church was burned by discontented Indians in 1704, and again during an Indian outbreak in 1712. Father de l'Halle was killed by the Indians in 1706.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Other <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> during this period were the Recollect Fathers Bonaventure, Dominic de la Marche, Cherubin Denieau, Hyacinth Pelifresne, and Simplicius Bouquet (1752-82) and the Sulpitian Fathers Calvarin, Mercier, and Thaumur de la Somce. Detroit remained under English domination until 1796, when with the change of political control the <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> passed to Bishop Carroll of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec recalled his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from the Michigan territory. Among those ministering at Detroit during the English occupation were Father Thomas Portier, who died in 1781, and Father John Francis Hubert, who was made Coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec in June, 1785.</p>

<p>At the dawn of the nineteenth century Detroit, still a military post, had a population of about 2000, mainly <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. St. Anne's parish then comprised the whole of the present <a href="10280a.htm">State of Michigan</a> and most of <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>. In 1796 Bishop Carroll sent the Sulpitian Father Michael Levadoux to take charge at Detroit. In June of the same year Fathers Gabriel Richard and Dilhet were appointed to assist him, the latter taking up his residence at Raisin River. Father Levadoux was recalled to <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1801. Father Richard succeeded him and became not only <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Anne's, but one of the leading figures in the development of the West. This remarkable <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> was born at Saintes, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, 15 October, 1767. His father was a government employee, and his mother Genevi&egrave;ve Bossuet, a scion of the same <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> as the great <a href="02698b.htm">Bishop of Meaux</a>. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> as a Sulpitian at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in October, 1791. The <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> drove him from his native land, and with Fathers Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, Ciquard, and Matigonon, he arrived in <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 24 June, 1792. It was intended that they should be teachers at St. Mary's Seminary, but they were assigned to missionary work instead, as the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> was not then ready for them. Father Richard was sent to Prairie du Rocher and Kaskaskia, <a href="07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, where he spent six years of hardship and privation, but fruitful in the results of his <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> ministrations. When he arrived at Detroit in June, 1798, he found religious conditions far from ideal, the town having been for years an Indian trading centre. He began at once to exert a salutary influence for the reformation of existing abuses and devoted himself also to promoting the welfare of the numerous Indian missions in the surrounding country. In the summer of 1801 he had <a href="04717b.htm">Bishop Denaut</a> of Quebec visit Detroit on the invitation of Bishop Carroll and confirm 521 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of ages ranging from thirteen to eighty years. His <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> list of their names and ages is still kept in St. Anne's archives. In 1804 he started a Young Ladies' Academy and a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> to foster vocations for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> for young men, but a fire which destroyed the town 11 June, 1805, swept these away as well as the church and priests' residence. So active were his resourceful methods that within three years another church was provided, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of Detroit were again in operation, and tuition given in six primary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and two academies for girls. He was one of the founders of the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of Michigan, which began with the act of the legislature passed 26 August, 1817, establishing "the Catholepistemiad or <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of Michigan" of which he was vice president and professor for six of the thirteen departments of which its curriculum was made up. In 1807 the governor and other officials requested him to lecture to them and thus afforded him the opportunity to be the first <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> to deliver a series of religious lectures to non-Catholics. He spoke to them on the general principles of religion and morality at noon every <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in the Council House. Explaining this action to Bishop Carroll, he wrote: "As there was no English minister here of any denomination, I thought it might be of some utility to take possession of the ground." The following year he went to Baltimore and brought back type and a printing press which he set up in Detroit. From this, on 31 August, 1809, he issued the "Michigan Essay or Impartial Observer", the first paper published in <a href="10280a.htm">Michigan</a> and the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. It had several columns printed in French and the rest in English and had only one advertisement &mdash; that of St. Anne's <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. Between 1809 and 1812 he printed on this press seven books of a religious and <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> character, one, "The Epistles and Gospels for all the Sundays and Feast-days of the Year", being the first publication in the Northwest of a part of the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of 1812 with <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> demoralized conditions in Detroit, which fell into the hands of the British. Father Richard was arrested and kept a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> during the contest. On being released he returned to his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> and was at once busy helping everybody to repair the ravages of the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>. In 1823 he was elected a Delegate to Congress from <a href="10280a.htm">Michigan</a> Territory, the only instance in which a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> has held a seat in the House of Representatives. He had five opponents at the polls, but many non-Catholics voted for him, which outweighed the bitter opposition of a number of members of his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> led by one of the trustees who had long been at enmity with him. He gave his salary for the improvement of the church. Just before he left for Washington he was put in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> by one of his parishioners who had obtained a <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> in a civil court and remarried. Father Richard declared him <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and the man sued for damages to his <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a> and business and got a judgment of $1,116. This Father Richard refused to pay, and he was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> until three of his friends gave a bond for him. The judgment was eventually reversed. In Congress he worked assiduously for the interests of <a href="10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, but the only notable speech he made was that advocating the bill for the opening of a post-road from Detroit to <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. He sought re-election at the end of his term, but was defeated, mainly through the exertions of his trustee opponents. When Bishop Fenwick was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> in 1822 Michigan passed from Bardstown to that <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Father Richard prepared for him a statement of the condition of the Territory, in which he then estimated there were about 6000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with five churches and two <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> &mdash; himself and his assistant. An epidemic of cholera broke out in Detroit in the summer of 1832, and the venerable missionary, while unstintingly devoting himself to the help of the suffering, fell a victim to the disease, of which he died, 13 September, 1832. Preparations had been under way even then to raise Detroit to a <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, of which, had he lived, he would probably have received the <a href="10404a.htm">mitre</a>.</p>

<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>(1) John Frederic Reze (the name is also given as Reese in the German <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> records), who had been a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary throughout the territory, was appointed the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> 25 February, 1833, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> 6 October of the same year. He was born 6 February, 1791, at Viennenberg, <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, and enjoys the distinction of being the first German-born <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the American <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Drafted into military service in his youth, he served under Bl&uuml;cher as a dragoon at the battle of Waterloo. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1822, and <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the American missions in 1825, affiliating himself with Bishop Fenwick in <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. In 1827 he was sent to <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> to secure <a href="06484b.htm">German</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and financial aid for the struggling missions and returned in a year, after success in both efforts. Through his exertions the famous Leopoldine Association that gave so much substantial help to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> was founded in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1829. When he look charge of the Diocese of Detroit there were eight churches and the Ottawa Indian mission within its limits. Under his auspices the Poor Glares opened a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in Detroit and a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="06777a.htm">Green Bay</a> (1833). <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> church was built at Detroit, and <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> established at Monroe, Grand River, and Bertrand. A <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> was opened in Detroit in 1834 during an outbreak of cholera, where also St. Philip's College, an <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, Trinity Academy, and a house of the Ladies of Providence were established, with several <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, was attacked with softening of the brain and expressed in a letter to the <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, in 1837, a wish to resign or transfer the administration to a coadjutor. He was suspended from all episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he remained until the disorders in the city by the revolutionists in 1848, and then retired to his native <a href="07353a.htm">Diocese of Hildesheim</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where he died at the mother-house of the Sisters Of Charity, 30 December, 1871, and was buried in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of that place.</p>

<p>(2) Peter Paul Lefebre, another active and successful missionary of the <a href="03773a.htm">Diocese of Cincinnati</a>, was named as the coadjutor and administrator of Detroit, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Zella, at Philadelphia, 21 November, 1841. He was born 30 April, 1804, at Roulers, near <a href="06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and, emigrating to the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1828, was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at St. Louis, 17 July, 1831. He was in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> when he was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but returned at once for his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. He was a careful and conservative <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, forecasting the future in his selection of church sites, and devoting himself actively to the expansion of the facilities for the practice of the Faith in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the spread of sound <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. The <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> and the Religious of the Sacred Heart were established in Detroit, and for the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> the <a href="08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, the Sisters of Notre Dame, the Sisters of Charity, and the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary were brought into the diocese. In 1844 the creation of the new See of <a href="10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a> relieved the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Detroit of the care of that section and enabled him to devote more attention to his Indian missions, which were developed splendidly. In 1857 the separation of the Diocese of Sault-Ste-Marie was made at Bishop Lefebre's suggestion. With Bishop Spalding he was mainly instrumental in founding, in 1857, the <a href="01424a.htm">American College at Louvain</a>. He died, 4 March, 1869.</p>

<p>(3) <a href="02684c.htm">Casper H. Borgess</a> was appointed his successor and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Calyson and coadjutor and administrator of Detroit, 24 April, 1870. On the death of Bishop Reze, 30 December, 1871, he assumed the title of Detroit. He resigned 16 April, 1888, and died 3 May, 1890.</p>

<p>(4) John Samuel Foley was named the fourth <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 4 November, 1888. He was born in that city 5 November, 1833, and <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> 20 December, 1856. His brother was Bishop Thomas Foley, administrator of <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a> (1870-79). The early settlers of Detroit had been French; these were followed, at different intervals, by <a href="02395a.htm">Belgians</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>, Poles, <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a>. Bishop Foley established a special <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the Poles and secured the ministrations of religious of that nationality. A <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> among them of several years' duration, and of disastrous results, was healed through his forbearance. In 1907 the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the golden jubilee of his <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, presented Bishop Foley with St. Francis's Home for Orphan Boys, built at a cost of $250,000.</p>

<h2>Religious orders</h2>

<p>The Congregation of the Sisters Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary was founded at Monroe, <a href="10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, 28 Nov., 1845, by the Rev. Louis Gillet, C. SS. R. Three young ladies, two from <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and one from Detroit, formed the new community, whose rule was taken from that of <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>, and whose secondary object was the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of youth. In 1859 some of the sisters went to <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; there are now three distinct mother-houses, one in the <a href="11793b.htm">Archdiocese of Philadelphia</a>, one in the <a href="13633a.htm">Diocese of Scranton</a>, and the original at Monroe, in the Diocese of Detroit.
