<p>Eucharistic Congresses are gatherings of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> for the purpose of celebrating and glorifying the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> and of seeking the best means to spread its <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> throughout the world. The <a href="05573a.htm">Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist</a> is one of the principal <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> and is therefore of paramount importance as the most precious treasure that Christ has left to His <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as the centre of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship and as the source of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. The main advantages of these congresses have been in the concentration of the thoughts of the faithful upon the mystery of the altar, and in making known to them the means by which devotion towards the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> may be promoted and implanted in the hearts of the people. The promoters of Eucharistic congresses believe that, if during recent years devotion to the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> has become more widespread, if works of adoration, Confraternities of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and the practice of frequent Communion have spread rapidly and extensively, it must be ascribed in great part to these gatherings.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The first congress owed its inspiration to <a href="13686a.htm">Bishop Gaston de S&eacute;gur</a>, and was held at <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, 21 June, 1881. The <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> at first was merely local and met with few adherents, but it grew from year to year with an ever-increasing importance. The second gathering was at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, in 1882, and the third at <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, in the following year. When from the 9th to the 13th of September, 1885, the fourth congress met at <a href="06302a.htm">Fribourg</a> in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, under the presidency of the famous Mgr. Mermillod, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09040a.htm">Lausanne and Geneva</a>, his influence and example drew to the platform members of the Cantonal Government, officials of the municipality of Fribourg, officers of the army, judges of the courts, while thousands of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from all over <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> joined in the formal procession. <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, in the South of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, was the place of meeting of the fifth congress, from the 20th to the 25th of June, 1S86, and about 1500 <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and 30,000 <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> were present at the closing exercises.</p>

<p>The sixth congress met in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 2-6 July, 1888, and the great memorial church of the Sacred Heart on Monmartre was the centre of the proceedings. Antwerp, in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, entertained the next congress, 15-21 August, 1890; an immense altar of repose was erected in the Place de Meir, and it was estimated that 150,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> were gathered about it when <a href="06648a.htm">Cardinal Goossens</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, gave the solemn Benediction. Bishop Doutreloux of <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> was then president of the Permanent Committee for the Organization of Eucharistic Congresses, the body which has charge of the details of these meetings.</p>

<p>Special importance was attached to the eighth congress, which went to Jerusalem to hold its sessions from the 14th to the 21st of May, 1893. <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> sent as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> Cardinal Lang&eacute;nieux, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>. Here the reunion of the Orient was advocated, and an adoration of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was preached on the very spot where tradition says the <a href="01224a.htm">Agony in the Garden</a> took place. Next year the congress was held at <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 25-29 July, and the different churches of the East were largely represented. A place was given in the deliberations for the first time to the study of social questions affecting the <a href="08719a.htm">working</a> classes. Paray-le-Monial, the city of the Sacred Heart, 20-24 September, 1897, was the scene of the tenth congress; and the eleventh, the best organized and most numerously attended of the series, met at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 13-17 July, 1898. Cardinal Lang&eacute;nieux was again the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> at the twelfth congress which had Lourdes, the city of Eucharistic <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as its meeting place, 7-11 August, 1889. This gathering was notable for the number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who took part in the procession. When the thirteenth congress met at <a href="01489b.htm">Angers</a>, 4-8 September, 1901, a special section was formed for young men to read and discuss papers having reference to such works as young men ought to undertake for the promotion of devotion to the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> and the solution of social questions. Namur, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 3-7 September, 1902, was chosen as the location for the fourteenth congress, and the fifteenth, 20-24 July, 1904, went to Angoul&ecirc;me where the operations of French law forbade the usual procession of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>.</p>

<p><a href="12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> having expressed a wish that the Eucharistic Congress should be held in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the delegates met there, 1-6 June, 1905. He added to the solemnity of the occasion by celebrating <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>, at the opening of the sessions, by giving a special audience to the delegates, and by being present at the procession that closed the proceedings. It was the dawn of the movement that led to his <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, "Tridentina Synodus", 20 December, 1905, advising daily communions.</p>

<p>Tournai, in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, saw the seventeenth congress, 15-19 August, 1906; and the next one went to <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, in <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, 7-11 August, 1907. Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli was the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>, and the German Government suspended the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of 1870, forbidding processions, in order that the usual solemn procession of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> might be held. Each year the congress had become more and more definitely international, and at the invitation of Archbishop Bourne of Westminster it was decided to hold the nineteenth congress in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, the first under the auspices of, and among, English-speaking members of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>



<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In addition to these general congresses there had also grown up, in all countries where <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were numerous, local gatherings of the Eucharistic leagues which were potent factors in the spread of the devotion. These were held in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a>, and the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. The first of these in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> was at St. Louis, in September, 1901; the second at New York, in 1905; and the third at <a href="12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, in 1907. The presidents of the Permanent Committee of the International Eucharistic Congresses, under whose direction all this progress was made were: <a href="13686a.htm">Bishop Gaston de S&eacute;gur</a>, of <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a>; Archbishop de La Bouillerie, titular of Perga and coadjutor of <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>; Archbishop Duquesnay of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>; Cardinal Mermillod, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09040a.htm">Lausanne and Geneva</a>; Bishop Doutreloux of <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and Bishop Thomas Heylen of <a href="10679a.htm">Namur</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. After each congress this committee prepared and published a volume giving a report of all the papers read and the discussions on them in the various sections of the meeting, the sermons preached, the addresses made at the public meetings, and the details of all that transpired.</p>

<p>As the most representative and important of all the congresses, the whole <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world was at once interested in the nineteenth, which was held in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, 9-13 September, 1908, and regarded as the greatest religious triumph of its generation. In an affectionate letter voicing anew his interest in these congresses, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> once more designated Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli as his <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to attend the sessions. More than three hundred and fifty years had elapsed since a <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had been seen in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. With him were six other <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, fourteen <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, seventy <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and a host of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. No such gathering of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> had ever been seen outside of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in modern times, and <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> prepared to make it locally even more memorable. The seeds of "the Second Spring", one of them aptly said, awakened by the tears and blood of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and strengthened by the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the remnant of the faithful in the dreary years of the <a href="11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, bore flower and fruit.</p>

<p>A distinguished escort met Cardinal Vannutelli when he landed at Dover, and an enormous crowd assembled to witness the arrival of a <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> for the first time in more than three centuries. On the next day, 9 September, the congress was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> opened in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, by the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>, supported by Cardinals Gibbons of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Logue of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Sancha y Herv&agrave;s of Toledo, Ferrari of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Mathieu of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and Mercier of <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Bishops, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> from all quarters of the globe were about them. The regular sessions began on 10 September, Archbishop Amette of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> celebrating the Mass. Two sectional meetings in English and one in French then listened to the papers and discussions. In the evening there was a great meeting of 15,000 people at the Albert Hall, to greet the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, at which meeting resolutions pledging all to promote devotion to the Eucharist and unalterable fidelity to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were passed. The speakers included Archbishops Carr of <a href="10155a.htm">Melbourne</a> and Bruchesi of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. On 11 September Archbishop Van der Wetering, of <a href="15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, was the celebrant of the Mass, and the next day <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated according to the Byzantine Rite by the Very Reverend Arsenius Atiych, <a href="01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> of the church of Saint-Julienle-Pauvre of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, assisted by several Greek Assumptionist <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from Constantinople. The Mass on Sunday, 13 September, celebrated by the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, and at which Cardinal Gibbons preached, closed the series of splendid ceremonies that marked the congress. <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> followed, and then the solemn procession took place.</p>

<p>It had been intended to carry the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> through the streets, but, owing to a protest and public clamour against this, made by the <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> composing the Protestant Alliance, the Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, sent a formal request to Archbishop Bourne on the part of "His Majesty's Government", for the abandonment of this programme, and this was complied with. The <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>, attended by a guard of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> headed by the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and made up of eleven English noblemen and the Duke of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and the Comte d'Eu and some members of the French Chamber of Deputies, after passing over the route, gave solemn benediction from the balcony of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to the multitude below. Telegraphing after the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Cardinal Vannutelli said to the Cardinal Secretary of State: "The Congress concluded with a great triumph today when the procession passed through the streets of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> packed with crowds raising continuous cheers for the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> and the other <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The Sacred Host was not carried in the procession, but I gave a final benediction with the Sacrament to the crowd from three open balconies on the <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Members of the House of Lords formed an escort of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> for me. Perfect order was kept."</p>

<p>The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> sent a special letter to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a> after the congress concluded, stating that, though it was the first of its kind in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, it must be looked on as the greatest of all, for its concourse of illustrious men, for the weight of its deliberations, for its display of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and for the magnificence of its religious functions. He thanked the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and all who had taken any part in the proceedings. Before it closed the congress decided to have the session of 1909 meet at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and that of 1910 at <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois D&eacute;sir&eacute;, <a href="10048a.htm">Cardinal Mathieu</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, who had attended the Congress, was stricken with an illness that necessitated an operation shortly after his arrival in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. He died in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> from the effects of this on the 25th of October following. Another great dignitary of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> who was called to his reward shortly after assisting at this memorable congress was Ciriaco Maria, Cardinal Sancha y Herv&agrave;s, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo and <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the West Indies, who died at Toledo, 25 February, 1909, in the seventy-first year of his age.</p>
