<p>The proper support of church edifices and church institutions, as well as of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> who minister in them, has always been both a necessity and a problem. As the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ is a visible organization, it must embrace a visible <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, worship, and <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a>. These must be maintained. As a consequence, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> must acquire <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> both movable and immovable, and this she cannot obtain without a corresponding generosity on the part of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. To pretend that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> should be utterly deprived of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, is not only an <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, but also an absurdity. In the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Dispensation</a>, the Jewish <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> were put in possession of certain towns all through <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and by the <a href="10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> they received a portion of various <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered in the Temple. The magnificent Temple itself was a gift of the kings of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and its maintenance was provided for partly by royal munificence, partly by the offerings of the people. The Temple had its treasury or <em>corbona</em>. By Divine command, as we read in Scripture, the Aaronic <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> received <a href="06082a.htm">firstfruits</a>, <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and other contributions towards their support.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Apostolic times</h2>

<p>Nor was there less recognition of the general principle in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. We are told that Christ and His <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> had a common purse for the defraying of their expenses. That this information comes to us only incidentally, through the narration of an event bearing no direct relation to it, shows that the <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> presumes the reader to take it for granted that there was a common purse for the expenses of Christ and His disciples. The <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> portray to us the fervour of the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who sold their lands and laid their proceeds at the feet of the Apostles that they might employ them for the needs of the nascent Church. Along with the support of the poor and the <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> and the <a href="11322b.htm">orphan</a>, would also necessarily be included the sustentation of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the defraying of the expenses connected with the worship of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Christ in sending forth His disciples to preach told them to accept what was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their support from the people to whom they ministered, basing it on the general principle that the labourer is worthy of his hire (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs7">Luke 10:7</a>); <a href="11567b.htm">Saint Paul states</a> (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm">1 Corinthians 9</a>) that it is <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> command that the faithful give temporal sustenance to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. While reminding the Corinthians that he himself has been no charge or burden to them, he takes occasion to inculcate on them the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of supporting their <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>. "If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things? Know you not that they who work in the holy place, eat the things that are of the place; and that they that serve the altar, partake with the altar? So also the Lord ordained that they who preach the Gospel, should live by the Gospel" (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs11">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>, <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs13">13</a>-<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs14">14</a>).</p>

<p>Connected with this contribution towards the support of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, we find <a href="11567b.htm">Saint Paul</a> also alluding to the similar <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of helping the poor. In the fifteenth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans he states that contributions had been made in <a href="12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> and <a href="01101c.htm">Achaia</a> for the support of the poor in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and that he is on his way to that city to bring the contributed relief (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs25">Romans 15:25-28</a>). In like manner (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm">1 Timothy 5</a>) he speaks of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> supporting the <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a>. The Apostles in fact, as we learn from the Acts, charged the <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> with the ministry to the temporal wants of the poor. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has always been mindful of this conjoining of the support of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of church institutions with that of the poor and suffering, and hence the regulations for setting apart some of the income of holders of <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> and the employment of church moneys for the relief of the helpless and the indigent, the <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a>, the <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and the sick.</p>

<h2>The early Church</h2>

<p>From the beginnings of the <a href="03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> history, as we gather it from the Fathers and early <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, the faithful made <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> offerings to defray the expenses of Divine worship and to support the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the poor. Though these offerings would naturally be for the most part in money and in kind, yet we find also <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> set aside for <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes. Thus the <a href="03510a.htm">Christian cemeteries</a> or <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a> and the "titles" or houses where Mass was offered seem very early, even in the lifetime of the Apostles, to have become <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to church uses. That in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> they passed into the possession of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and became <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a> in the modern sense of the term, is evident from various edicts and decrees of the Roman Emperors, as, for example, of <a href="02108b.htm">Aurelian</a> and Constantine. These show conclusively that, even in the times of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> by <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> rulers, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had lands and edifices of various kinds in its possession. Nor was this state of things confined to the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but it was practised and recognized all over the Roman Empire.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>The endowed Church</h2>

<p>When peace was given to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by Constantine, at the beginning of the fourth century, an era of temporal prosperity for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> set in. As the Empire gradually became <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, the donations for religious purposes increased by leaps and bounds. Constantine himself set an example for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> rulers who followed him, when he bestowed upon the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the Lateran palace and erected magnificent <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Apostles Saint Peter and <a href="11567b.htm">Saint Paul</a>. Henceforth the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>, which had been formerly adverse to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, became its protector. Gifts of money and land for <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes were now legally recognized, and though some of the later Roman emperors placed restrictions upon the donations of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, yet the wealth of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> rapidly increased. Whatever losses <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> suffered by the inroads of the barbarians on the fall of the Western Roman Empire, in the last quarter of the fifth century, were made up for later, when the conquering barbarians in their turn were <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="03041a.htm">Edifices for Divine worship</a>, asylums for the poor and sick, <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="04340c.htm">nunneries</a>, <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and collegiate churches, chantries and preceptories, were founded and endowed in great numbers. The spirit of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> manifested itself in conferring on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> the means for adding becoming splendour to the celebration of Divine worship and for founding <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> to support the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The bitter complaint made, after the so-called <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, that "under the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> giving had no end" was <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> to a surprising extent. Landed <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> became as a rule the title for the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>. A great advantage of this system was that the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were not <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make constant demands on their flocks for the means of livelihood or to sustain worship; and only those who felt impelled to give <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> were looked to for offerings. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> always insisted on the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a> that the faithful must support their <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>, yet this support was generally provided for by perpetual foundations, not dependent on the temporary generosity of the people. The wealth of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at this period has sometimes been made a matter of reproach to her, but while freely admitting that abuses were possible and indeed at times unquestionable, yet this was in contravention of the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was never the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> intention that her <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> should acquire <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> or income for the purpose of leading an indulgent or luxurious life. The saying of <a href="01383c.htm">Saint Ambrose</a> that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has wealth not in order to hoard it, but to bestow it on those who are in need of it, was always recognized as a bounden <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>. Hence the canonical restrictions placed upon the holder of a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> in the employment of his income, and the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> imposed upon him of setting aside part of it for the poor. It must not be forgotten that when the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was wealthiest, it covered <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> with asylums and places of refuge for every form of poverty and distress, and that the great landed <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were also noted for their hospitality to <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, their generosity to the indigent, and their <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. It is also noteworthy that despite the calamitous usurpations of the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a> in many countries, which reduced the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to comparative indigence, yet the fervour of vocations has never been chilled by the loss of endowments and pensions. The canon law contains many severe regulations against <a href="02148b.htm">avarice</a> and <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> in the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. As this is not a technical treatment of the question of <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>, nothing is here said specially of the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> governing its acquisition, administration, and alienation; neither, for the same reason, do we enter into any detail concerning the regulations made for <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> and those who hold them. It is intended merely to point out, in general, the temporal means and the sources of support of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions and of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> during the course of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> history. The rapacities of Governments and the <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> of revolutions have torn from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> many of her endowments in most countries of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and all of them in some. In such cases the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> must again, as in the earliest times, look to the direct generosity of the faithful for their support and for the means of carrying on the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> and benevolent institutions of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Missionary countries</h2>

<p>It is particularly in countries where the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has never been endowed and established, and in those where all such advantages have been entirely withdrawn from her, that the problem of Church maintenance must be faced in all its nakedness. To show what means have been employed to solve this difficult problem, and likewise to give some appreciation of the generosity of the not over-wealthy faithful on the one hand and of the care of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rulers to avoid abuses on the other, it will be well to chronicle the decrees of various <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> in countries where church maintenance is a burning question. The <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, first of all, insist on the fact that the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> are bound by the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a> to support the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> who are their spiritual guides. The First Synod of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1791 declares: "Owing to the increasing number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> dispersed over widely-separated tracts of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, there is need of a much larger number than formerly of labourers in the Lord's vineyard, and these cannot be obtained or supported unless the means be given by the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as indeed they are bound by Divine precept to give them, for the Apostle says that it is but just that those who sow spiritual things for others should reap of the latter's carnal things (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs11">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>). Therefore the faithful should be frequently reminded of this <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and if they do not satisfy it, they have only themselves to blame if they cannot have Mass on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> or feast days nor obtain the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in their extreme necessities. Consequently, when in proportion to the worldly goods with which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has endowed them, they refuse to contribute to the ministry of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and so do not satisfy the Divine and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> precept through their own fault, let them <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that they are in a state of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and unworthy of obtaining reconciliation in the tribunal of penance; and moreover that they will have to give an account to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, not only for their own <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also for the dense <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and vices of the poor who on account of the miserable parsimony of the richer people are entirely deprived of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> instruction. In order therefore that what is done in other parts of the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a> should have a beginning among us, we have made decrees concerning the offerings of the faithful" (Decr. 23). The Fathers give these regulations concerning the contributions: "The offerings according to the ancient custom of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, are to be divided into three parts if it be <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>; so that one part may be applied to the support of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, one to the relief of the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and one for obtaining such things as are <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the Divine worship and the church fabric. If provision has already been made from other sources for the sustentation of the <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the sanctuary and for the relief of the indigent, then all the offerings should be used for procuring <a href="01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and other things <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the Divine service, for repairing the churches or for building new ones" (Decr. 7). In 1837, the Fathers of the Third <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> say: "Lest <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> be forced to beg or suffer such penury as is unbecoming to their sacred order, we exhort the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to admonish the faithful of their <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to supply a proper sustenance for those especially who labour in word and <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> among them. And if on account of sickness or other cause they be not able to fulfil their sacred ministry, lest affliction be added to affliction, let what is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> be supplied to them by the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> to whom they have ministered. If the congregation be too poor to do so, we exhort the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to use all the means in their power to arouse the charity of other <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and other congregations in their behalf" (Decr. 2). The Third <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, in 1861, declares: "Treating of the proper support of the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>, the Fathers unanimously agreed that the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> are bound under grave <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> to give him sustenance; but that the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> on his side, if called to assist a dying <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who has refused to fulfil this <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> though able to do so, is also bound under grave <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> to visit him, on account of the serious <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of charity towards a dying man placed in extreme necessity." In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, we find the following in the First <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Westminster, held in the year 1855: "As the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of paying <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> does not exist among us, let the faithful be warned that they are not freed thereby from the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of providing for Divine worship and for the proper support of the sacred <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>" (Decr. 4). "The faithful who through devotion or for any other cause do not frequent the quasi-parochial church or missionary to whom by domicile they are assigned, should not imagine themselves to be freed from the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of assisting the church and supporting their <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>. They should also be as solicitous as those who attend their proper church for relieving the misery of the poor and for <a href="05295b.htm">educating</a> the young. Therefore, by <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> giving according to their means, let them strengthen their legitimate <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> who must sustain the burden and heat of the day in cultivating the vineyard of the Lord" (Decr. 5). The payment of <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> is declared to be binding on the faithful of the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> by the Fourth <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a>, in 1868: "As the <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> has crept into many minds that <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> and other <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> which are paid to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or her <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> for their support and to enable them to fulfil their <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> towards the faithful of whom they have spiritual charge, are to be paid only through force of <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>, and that the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of giving them does not arise from any other source, in order that this <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> be entirely corrected and completely removed, we consider it opportune to declare and <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> that this <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> is derived specially from the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> herself has made or can make independently of the <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>; and that it pertains to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of each <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> to impose <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> concerning this matter upon the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as necessity shall require, and taking into consideration circumstances of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> and places. Wherefore if it seems just and opportune to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to demand a tax, defined with proper moderation, of the faithful of any place, whether the <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> there prescribes or does not prescribe the paying of <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>, let each of them pay it to the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> to whom under any title belongs the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of ministering to their spiritual needs. There can be no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the faithful of that place severally are bound in <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> to pay this tax, and anyone who refuses is to be visited with penalties according to the circumstances. What has been said of the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> on the faithful of supporting their <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> is also to be held concerning the building and the reparation of <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> and churches, namely that it binds the <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the faithful" (Decr. 16). In <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the Third <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, in 1858, treats also of <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>: "in collecting the offerings of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who emulating the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and even the Hebrews are accustomed to contribute the <a href="06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of grain and other products to <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and vicars as to the <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, we ordain that no more be demanded than what is offered spontaneously and <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>. Reproaches against those who may perchance show themselves less liberal, are to be avoided under pain of suspension" (cap. xvii, 1).</p>

<h2>Blessings of giving</h2>

<p>The <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> that it is more blessed to give than to receive is also insisted on by the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>. Speaking of contributions for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the pastoral letter of the Fifth <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (1843) says: "It is by placing the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions in the respective <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> on solid foundations, that you will secure for yourselves and your children the perpetuity of the <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a> wherewith it has pleased <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to enrich you in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. Those to whom the wealth of this world has been given, cannot better employ a portion of it than in providing for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the altar. We are far, however, from meaning to undervalue the offerings which <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> may inspire for the erection of <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> to the glory of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, or charity may present for the clothing and maintenance of the <a href="11322b.htm">orphan</a>. We exhort you brethren to follow the impulse of the Holy Ghost in the various <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> for which your charitable co-operation is solicited, and to remember in the day of your abundance, that whatever you set apart to the glory of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, in the exercise of charity, is so much secured against the caprice of fortune. 'Be not then high-minded, nor hope in uncertain riches, but in the <a href="06608a.htm">living God</a> (who giveth us abundantly, all things to enjoy), do good, be rich in <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, distribute readily, communicate, lay up in store for yourselves a good foundation against the time to come, that you may obtain <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> life" (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs17">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>). Again the Fathers of the Sixth <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> (in 1846) write: "On you it depends to give, especially to those who labour in word and <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, that support which will leave them without solicitude for the things of this world, that they may wholly apply themselves to the exercise of the holy ministry. We beseech you, brethren, to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> them who labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you, that you may esteem them more abundantly in charity for their work's sake. To you we look for means to <a href="05295b.htm">educate</a> youth for the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, that when fully instructed in the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of their holy vocation, and trained in discipline, they may become fit <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and adorn it by their <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, as well as by their talents. You should aid in the erection of the <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> in which you and your children are to worship, and see that the house of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> be not unworthy of the sublime functions which are to be performed in it. Of the worldly goods which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has bestowed on you, you should set apart a reasonable portion to be specially devoted to His glory; and you should rejoice at the opportunity thus afforded you to manifest your gratitude for His benefits." The Fathers of the First <a href="02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1852) joyfully acknowledged the generosity of the faithful: "The wants of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in this vast country so rapidly advancing in population and prosperity, impose on us, your <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and on you, our children in Christ, peculiar and very arduous <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>. We have not only to build up the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, by the preaching of the Gospel, and the inculcation of all the virtues it teaches, but also to supply the material wants of religious worship in proportion to the unexampled rapidity with which our flocks increase. We have to establish missions in places where, but a few years since, none or but few <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were to be found, and where now the children of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> cry with clamorous importunity for the bread of life. We have to build the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, where before <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> name was not publicly worshipped; and to multiply His <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> where they no longer suffice for the constantly increasing wants of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. We have to provide a ministry for the present and future wants of the country, and in this matter we have to contend with difficulties which are unknown in countries where religion has been long established, and where the <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of past generations have furnished ample means for this most important object. We have to provide for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of our youth. We have not only to erect and maintain the church, the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the schoolhouse, but we have to found <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, establish <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and provide for every want of suffering humanity, which religion forbids us to neglect. We thank the Giver of all good gifts for the extraordinary benediction which He has hitherto bestowed upon our efforts, and those of the venerable men whose places we fill. We rejoice at having the opportunity of bearing public testimony to the generous assistance which we have received from our flocks in our respective <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Much however as has been done, much still remains to be accomplished. Our churches are nowhere equal to the wants of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, and, in many places, are far from being sufficiently spacious to afford one-half of our people the opportunity of attending Divine worship. We therefore exhort you, brethren, to co-operate generously and cheerfully with your <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>, when they appeal to you in behalf of <a href="03592a.htm">works of charity</a> and religious <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. In contributing to Divine worship, you make an offering to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of the gifts He has bestowed on you, and a portion of which He requires should be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to His service, as a testimony of your continued dependence on His sovereign mercy. We hope that the example of your <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> forefathers, and even of some among yourselves, will be generally felt and not infrequently imitated; and that here as well as elsewhere, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> will be able to show the <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> of her children's <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in the numerous <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> raised to the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> name, in the beauty of His sanctuary which the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> will ever <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, and in the ample and permanent provision made for the maintenance of public worship."</p>

<h2>Restrictions on the clergy</h2>

<p>While vigorously insisting on the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of giving on the part of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> demands on the part of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> that moderation and <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> be exercised and that abuses be avoided. The First Synod of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, in 1791, warns <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to avoid "all appearance of <a href="02148b.htm">avarice</a> or <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>". In the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Council of <a href="07117b.htm">Halifax</a>, in 1857 (Prov. I), it is decreed: "In the administration of the Sacraments care must be taken lest anything be done that savours of the horrible crime of <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> or <a href="02148b.htm">avarice</a> or filthy lucre, and the Sacraments must never be denied to any one under the pretext that he has not made the customary offerings. If any <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> acts otherwise, he is an unfaithful dispenser, he makes light of the ministry of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he <a href="13506d.htm">scandalizes</a> the little ones; and Such a delinquent should <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that he may be severely punished according to the judgment of the ordinary" (Decr. 4). The Plenary Synod of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, at Thurles in 1850, contains a similar <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> (Decr. 5): "In the offerings made by ancient and received usage in the administration of certain <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, let the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> beware lest anything be done that may savour of <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> or <a href="02148b.htm">avarice</a>. Let the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> never be denied under the pretext that offerings have not been made; otherwise the delinquents may be disciplined according to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> judgment." The following <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> (14) is found in the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the First <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Westminster (1855): "Where the custom obtains (which is indeed ancient in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>), of giving presents to individual <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, such offerings belong to them. But let every <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> be on his guard lest he fall under suspicion of receiving anything in view of the sacrament of penance administered by him." In 1854, the First Council of the Colonies of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> passed the following <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> (Art. vii, 2): "Let every ordinary determine the stipend for Masses and for everything else that may be accepted from the faithful in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions, an let no <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> infringe this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> under any circumstances, nor ever let them think that they are allowed to deny the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to those who, on account of their poverty, make no contributions. Let the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> keep before their eyes these words of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXII): 'Let them prohibit absolutely those importunate and illiberal exactions of <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> (for they are exactions rather than requests) and other similar things, which are not far removed from <a href="14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> guilt or the disgrace of seeking after lucre.'" The authority of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is needed for unusual demands on the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Thus the Second <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a> (1854): "It is not permitted to any <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="11727a.htm">ecclesiastical person</a> or <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> to make an extraordinary collection for any object whatever, unless the license of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has been asked and obtained" (Decr. 6). In Australia, the Second <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of 1869 makes a similar precept (No. xii): "We prohibit any collection under any title or pretext, without the permission of the ordinary." <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> enter into greater details (II Prov. Westmin.): "Every one seeking <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> from the faithful must have the autograph of the ordinary or of his own superior declaring the object of the collection, and the license of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place where he collects, under the condition expressed in his letters that he is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to render an accurate account to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or to his superior of all the money collected by him and stating explicitly where he obtained it, what <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> contributed it, and how long he remained in each place" (Decr. 21). In regard to stipends, the Second <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Quebec decrees: "Lest <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and rectors of churches fall under suspicion or acquire a bad reputation among their flocks, let them carefully distinguish their own <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> from those of their churches; nor may they change the tariff for <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions without the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, nor may they take anything as their own, except such things as the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> law or approved custom ascribes to them" (Art. xvi, &#167; 2, 8). <a href="07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>, writing to the <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a>, in 1841, declared: "As to what pertains to the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, let it be your care to admonish the faithful subject to you, that these Divine gifts are not to be received for any earthly price; but that they are to be distributed gratis by the <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> who have received them gratis; nor can any probable custom contrary to the canon law (against <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>) be pretended, for the purpose of asking money on the occasion of the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, when this has been rightly forbidden by you or the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a> by faculties received from us for the preservation of the <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>." The people are also warned against improper means for obtaining money for charitable purposes. The Pastoral Letter of the <a href="02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1866) says: "We warn our people most solemnly against the great abuses which have sprung up in the matter of fairs, excursions and picnics, in which, as too often conducted, the name of charity is made to cover a multitude of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>. We forbid all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from having anything to do with them except when managed in accordance with the regulations of the ordinary, and under the immediate supervision of their respective <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>." Certain abuses are sternly censured by the American <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (II Plen. Balt.): "It is reported, and we have learned it with great sorrow, that there are some <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in certain localities who during the Mass itself descend from the altar and go around in the church asking <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. We reprobate, and command the extirpation of this most disgraceful abuse, which is injurious to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and its sacred rites, and which provokes the derision and contempt of non-Catholics. Concerning this matter we lay the burden on the <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> of each of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>" (tit. vi, cap. i). Again in the same chapter the Fathers say: "We cannot but declare that it is an intolerable abuse and a profanation of holy things, when, as has often happened, public and frequent invitations to give <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> for the foundation [of Masses] are inserted for many months together in public newspapers among profane business notices. We desire the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and [regular] <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> to destroy this abuse without delay and prevent it in the future." Likewise when treating of pew-rent, the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> that certain seats must be left free, nor can the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> diminish the free space without the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (e.g. II Prov. Westmin., viii). As to collecting money at church entrances when the Sacred Mysteries are celebrated, the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, writing to the American <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in 1882 and again in 1866, declared that this practice was contrary to the desires of the <a href="12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>.</p>

<h2>Ways and means</h2>

<p>The principal methods of obtaining money for the support of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and church institutions, have been already touched on. We may summarize the main ones here. For <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> the Second <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Westminster (viii, De. bon. eccl.) enumerates: pew-rent, collections during Mass, seat money, <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> contributed on the occasion of a sermon by a distinguished preacher, and house-to-house collections. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, the same methods are employed. In some parts of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a> are payable, and the Third <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Quebec (No. ix) decreed for Upper <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> that a certain sum should be required of each of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, to be computed on the basis of the civil assessment roll. In addition to the above, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> may accept fixed stipends for Masses, and although they may not demand money for the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, yet they can receive what is spontaneously offered at <a href="02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, <a href="09707a.htm">marriages</a>, funerals, etc. The poor are to be buried gratis (II Plen. Balt., c. ii). No offering may be received for confession (II Prov. Westmin., viii, 14). Nor is any money to be asked for conferring extreme unction (Syn. Plen. Thurles for <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, xv). For the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and his assistants, a definite salary is usually fixed, payable out of the revenues of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> (III Plen. Balt., No. 273). To distinguish between <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> goods and <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> perquisites, the following rule is given: When the things offered are adapted for <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes, they are presumed to be given to the church; when they are for personal use, they are supposed to be given to the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The latter rule applies also to sacred objects if they are presented by the congregation to a particular <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, expressly as a token of gratitude and affection.</p>
