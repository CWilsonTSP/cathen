<p><a href="01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> comprising the Department of the Yonne. It was suppressed by the Concordat of 1802 which annexed to the <a href="15067a.htm">Diocese of Troyes</a> the Dioceses of Sens and Auxerre and by a somewhat complex combination gave the title of <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Auxerre to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, and the purely honorary title of <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Sens to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, otherwise deprived of all real <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Sens. The Concordat of 1817 reestablished the Archdiocese of Sens and the Diocese of Auxerre, but this arrangement did not last. The <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of July, 1821, the pontifical <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 4 Sept., 1821, the royal ordinance of 19 October, 1821, suppressed the Diocese of Auxerre and gave to the Archdiocese of Sens as territory all the Department of the Yonne, and as suffragan the Dioceses of <a href="15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, <a href="10778a.htm">Nevers</a>, and <a href="10603b.htm">Moulins</a>.

<h2>Diocese of Sens</h2>

<p>The history of the religious beginnings of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sens dates from Sts. Savinian and Potentian, and through some connecting legends also has to do with the Dioceses of <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, <a href="15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, and <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>. <a href="07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> is silent with regard to Sts. Savinian and Potentian, the founders of the See of Sens; the Hieronymian Martyrology which was revised somewhat before 600 at Auxerre or Autun, ignores them. The cities of <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a> and Troyes have nothing relative to these <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> in their local liturgy prior to the twelfth century, and that of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> nothing prior to the fifteenth, which recalls the preaching of Altinus, Eodaldus, and Serotinus, the companions of Sts. Savinian and Potentian. Previous to the ninth century there was in the cemetery near the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Pierre le Vif at Sens a group of <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> among which have been recognized those of the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sens. In 847 the solemn transfer of their bodies to the church of St-Pierre le Vif originated great popular devotion towards Sts. Savinian and Potentian. In 848 Wandelbert of Pr&uuml;m named them the first patrons of the church of Sens. Ado, in his <a href="09741a.htm">martyrology</a> published shortly afterwards, speaks of them as envoys of the Apostles and as <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The <a href="09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of Usuardus, about 875, indicates them as envoys of the "Roman pontiff" and as <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. In the middle of the tenth century the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of these two <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> were hidden in a subterranean vault of the Abbey of St-Pierre le Vif to escape the pillage of the Hungarians, but in 1031 they were placed in a beautiful <a href="12762a.htm">reliquary</a> executed by the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> Odoranne. This <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, in a chronicle published about 1045, speaks of Altinus, Eodaldus, and Serotinus as the apostolic companions of Savinian and Potentian, but does not regard them as having been sent by St. Peter.</p>

<p>In a document which, according to the Abb&eacute; Bouvier, dates from the end of the sixth century or the beginning of the seventh, but which, according to Mgr Duchesne was written in 1046 and 1079 under the inspiration of Gerbert, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Pierre le Vif, is developed for the first time a vast legend which traces to Sts. Savinian and Potentian and their companions the evangelization of the churches of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, and Troyes; this document Mgr Duchesne calls the Gerbertine legend. After some uncertainties and hesitations this legend became definitely fixed in the chronicle of Clarius, compiled about 1120. It impossible that the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> was preached at Sens in the second century, but we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> from Sidonius Apollinaris that in 475 the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sens had its thirteenth <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the list of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> does not permit the supposition that the <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> existed prior to the second half of the third century or the beginning of the fourth. Among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sens in the fourth century may be mentioned: St. Severinus, present at the <a href="13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> in 344; St. Ursicinus (356-87), exiled to Phrygia under Constantius through the influence of the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>, visited by St. Hilary on his return to Sens after three years of exile, and who about 386 founded at Sens the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sts. Gervasius and Protasius. In the fifth century: St. Ambrose (d. about 460); <a href="01230b.htm">St. Agroecius (Agrice)</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> about 475; St. Heraclius (487-515), founder of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. John the Evangelist at Sens. In the sixth century: St. Paul (515-25); St. Leo (530-41), who sent St. Aspais to evangelize Melun; St. Arthemius, present at the councils of 581 and 585, who admitted to public penance the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, St. Bond, and of, a criminal made a <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the seventh century: St. Lupus (Lou, or Leu), b. about 573, <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> approximately between 609 and 623, son of Blessed Betto, of the royal house of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and of Ste-Austregilde, founder of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ste-Colombe and perhaps also of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="06049d.htm">Ferri&egrave;res</a> in the Gatinais, which some historians, trusting to an <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> charter, believed to have been founded under <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a>; he secured from the king authorization to coin money in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; St. Annobertus (about 639); St. Gondelbertus (about 642-3), whose episcopate is only <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by the traditions of the Vosgian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Senones, which traditions date from the eleventh century; St. Arnoul (654-7); St. Emmon (658-75), who about the end of 668 received the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="01160a.htm">Hadrian</a>, sent to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> with <a href="14571a.htm">Archbishop Theodore</a>: perhaps St. Am&eacute; (about 676), exiled to P&eacute;ronne by Ebroin, and whose name is suppressed by Mgr Duchesne as having been interpolated in the episcopal lists in the tenth century; St. Vulfran (692-5), a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of Fontenelle, who soon left the See of Sens to evangelize Frisia and died at <a href="06129a.htm">Fontenelle</a> before 704; St. Gerie, <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> about 696. In the eighth century: St. Ebbo, at first <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Pierre le Vif, <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> before 711, and who in 731 placed himself at the head of his people to compel the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> to raise the siege of Sens; and his successor St. Merulf.</p>

<p>In the ninth century great <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> occupied the See of Sens: Magnus, former <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> before 802, author of a sort of hand book of legislation of which he made use when he journeyed as <em>missus dominicus</em>, or royal agent for <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, died after 817; Jeremias, ambassador at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> of Louis the Pious in the affair of the <a href="07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a>, died in 828; St. Alderic (829-36), former <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ferri&egrave;res, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Maur des Fosses at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 832; V&eacute;nilon (837-65) anointed Charles the Bald, 6 June, 843, in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, to the detriment of the privileges of the <a href="07356b.htm">See of Reims</a>; his <em><a href="16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a>,</em> or <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, was Andrade, author of numerous <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings, among others of the poem "De Fonte Vitae" dedicated to <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a>, and of the "Book of Revelations", by which he sought to put an end to the divisions between the sons of Louis the Pious. In 859 Charles the Bald accused V&eacute;nilon before the Council of Savonni&egrave;res of having betrayed him; the matter righted itself, but opinion continued to hold V&eacute;nilon guilty and the name of the traitor Ganelon, which occurs in the "Chanson de Roland" is but a popular corruption of the name V&eacute;nilon. Ansegisus (871-83), at the death of Louis II, Emperor of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, negotiated at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for Charles the Bald and brought thence the letter of <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a> inviting Charles to come and receive the imperial crown. He himself was named by <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a> <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> of the Gauls and Germania and vicar of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and at the Council of Ponthion was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> installed above the other <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> despite the opposition of <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a>; in 880 he anointed Louis III and Carloman in the abbey of Ferri&egrave;res. It was doubtless in the time of Ansegisus, while the See of Sens exercised a real primacy, that a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a> of his church compiled the historical work known as the "Ecclesiastical Annals of Sens" or "Gestes des Archev&ecirc;ques de Sens", an attempt to write the history of the first two French dynasties.</p>

<p>Vaulter (887-923) anointed King Eudes in 888, King Robert in July, 922, and King Raoul, 13 July, 923, in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of St-M&eacute;dard at <a href="14130c.htm">Soissons</a>; he doubtless inherited from his uncle Vaultier, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, a superb Sacramentary composed between 855 and 873 for the Abbey of St-Amand at Puelle. This Sacramentary, which he gave to the church of Sens, forms one of the most curious monuments of <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> art and is now in the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="14297a.htm">Stockholm</a>. Among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sens may also be mentioned: St. Anastasius (967-76 Sevinus (976-99), who presided at the Council of St-Basle and brought upon himself the disfavour of <a href="07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a> by his opposition to the deposition of Arnoul; Gelduinus (1032-49), deposed for <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> by <a href="09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> at the of the Council of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. The second half of the eleventh century was fatal to the Diocese of Sens. Under the episcopate of Richerius (1062-96), <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a> withdrew <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> authority from the See of Sens to confer it on that of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and Richerius died without having accepted this decision; his successor Daimbert (1098-1122) was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in March, 1098, only after having given assurance that he recognized the primacy of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Bishop Henri Sanglier (1122-42), caused the condemnation by a council in 1140 of certain propositions of <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a>. The see regained great prestige under Hugues de Toucy (1142-68), who at <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 1152 <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> Constance, wife of King Louis VII, despite the protests of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and under whose episcopate <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, driven from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, installed the pontifical Court at Sens for eighteen months after having taken the advice of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<p>Among later <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sens were: Guillaume aux Blanches Mains (1168-76), son of Thibaud IV, Count of Champagne, uncle of <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>, and first cousin of Henry II, who in 1172 in the name of <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> placed the Kingdom of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> under an <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> and in 1176 became <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>; Michael of Corbeil (1194-9), who combated the <a href="09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of "Publicans"; Peter of Corbeil (1200-22), who had been professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>; Pierre Roger (1329-30), later <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>; Guillaume de Brosse (1330-8), who erected at one of the doorways of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Sens an equestrian <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of Philip VI of Valois to perpetuate the remembrance of the victory won by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> over the pretentions of the legist Pierre de Cugni&egrave;res; Guillaume de Melun (1344-75), who together with King John II was taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the English at the battle of <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> in 1356; Guy de Roye (1385-90); Henri de Savoisy (1418-22), who at <a href="15067a.htm">Troyes</a> in 1420 blessed the marriage of Henry VI of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> with Catherine of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; Etienne Tristan de Salazar (1475-1519), who concluded the first treaty of alliance between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a>; Antoine* Duprat (q.v.) 1525-35, made <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1527; Louis de Bourbon Vende (1535-57), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, from 1517; Jean Bertrandi (1557-60), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1559; Louis de Lorraine (1560-2), Cardinal de <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> from 1553; Nicolas de Pellev&eacute; (1562-92), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> from 1570; Cardinal du Perron (1606-18); Languet de Gergy (730-53), first biographer of Marie Alacoque and member of the <a href="01089a.htm">French Academy</a>; Paul d'Albert (1753-88), Cardinal de Luynes after 1756 and member of the <a href="01089a.htm">French Academy</a>; Lom&eacute;nie de Brienne (1788-93), minister of Louis XVI, <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1788, and who during the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> <a href="11176a.htm">swore</a> to the civil constitution of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> but refused to <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the first constitutional <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, returned to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> his <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat, refused to become constitutional <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, was twice <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by the Jacobins of Sens and died in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> of apoplexy; Anne, Cardinal de la Fare (1821-9), Victor Felix Bernadou (1867-91), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1886.</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of Sens, which perhaps became a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="10244c.htm">see</a> at the middle of the fifth century, until 1622 numbered seven suffragans: Chartres, Auxerre, Meaux, Paris, <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, <a href="10778a.htm">Nevers</a>, and Troyes; the Diocese of Bethl&eacute;em at Clamecy (see <font SIZE="-1">NEVERS</font>; was also dependent on the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Sens. In 1622 <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> having been raised to a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="10244c.htm">see</a>, the Sees of <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and Meaux were separated from the Archdiocese of Sens. As indemnity the abbey of Mont Saint-Martin in the <a href="03209c.htm">Diocese of Cambrai</a> was united to the <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> revenue.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Diocese of Auxerre</h2>

<p>The "Gestes des &eacute;v&ecirc;ques d'Auxerre", written about 875 by the canons Rainogala and Alagus, and continued later down to 1278, gives a list of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> which, save for one detail, Mgr Duchesene regards as accurate; but the chronological data of the Gestes" seem to him to be very arbitrary for the period prior to the seventh century. No other church of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> glories in a similar list of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> as <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>; already in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> this multiplicity of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> was remarkable. St. Peregrinus (P&eacute;l&eacute;rin) was the founder of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>; according to the legend, he was sent by Situs II and was <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> under <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> in 303 or 304.</p>

<p>After him are mentioned without the possibility of certainly fixing their dates: St. Marcellianus, Valerianus, St. Helladius, St. Amator (d. 418), who had been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="14779a.htm">tonsured</a> by St. Helladius and who thus affords the earliest example of <a href="14779a.htm">ecclesiastical tonsure</a> mentioned in the <a href="07365a.htm">religious history</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; the illustrious St. Germain d'Auxerre (q.v.; 418-48); St. Elladius; St. Fratemus; St. Censurius, to whom about 475 the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Constantius sent the Life of St. Germain; <a href="15230a.htm">St. Ursus</a>; St. Theodosius, who assisted in 511 at the Council of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>; St. Gregorius; <a href="11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>; St. Droctoaldus; <a href="05379a.htm">St. Eleutherius</a>, who assisted at four Councils of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> between 533 and 549; <a href="13163a.htm">St. Romanus</a>; St. Actherius; St. Aunacharius (Aunaire; 573-605), uncle of St. Lupus, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Sens; St. Desiderius (Didier); St. Palladius, who assisted at several councils in 627, 650, and 654; <a href="15426c.htm">St. Vigilius</a>, who was assassinated about 684, doubtless at the instigation of Gilmer, son of Waraton, mayor of the palace; St. Tetricius (692-707); Venerable Aidulf (perhaps 751-66); Venerable Maurin (perhaps 766-94); Blessed Aaron (perhaps 794-807); Blessed Angelelmus (807-28); St. Heribaldus (829-57), first <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of Louis the Pious, and several times given ambassadorial charges; St. Abbo (857-69); Blessed Christian (860-71); Ven. Wibaldus (879-87), Ven. Herifridus (Herfroy; 887-909); St. G&eacute;ran (909-14); St. Betto (933-61); Ven. Guy (933961); Bl. John (997-998); Ven. Humbaud (1095-1114), drowned on the way to Jerusalem; St. Hugues de Montaigu (1116-1136), a friend of <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>; Bl. Hugues de M&acirc;con (1137-51), <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="12233a.htm">Pontigny</a>, often charged by <a href="05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> with adjusting differences and re-establishing order in <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; Ven. Alanus (1152-67), author of a life of St. Bernard; Ven. Guillaume de Toucy (1167-81), the first <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> who went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to acknowledge the authority of <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>.</p>

<p>Among later <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> may be mentioned: Hugues de Noyers (1183-1206), known as the "hammer of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>" for the vigour with which he sought out in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> of the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> and the "Caputi&eacute;s"; Guillaume de Seignelay (1207-20), who took part in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> and in 1230 became the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Ven. Bernard de Sully (1234-44); Guy de Mello (1247-70), who was <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> in the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> of Charles of Anjou against Manfred; Pierre de Mornay (1296-1306), who negotiated between <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> and Philippe le Bel and in 1304 became chancellor of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; Pierre de Cros (1349-51), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1350; Philippe de Lenoncourt (1560-62), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1586; Philibert Babou de la Bourdaisi&egrave;re (1562-70), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1561; the Hellenist <a href="01445a.htm">Jacques Amyot</a> (1571-93), translator of the works of Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus, tutor of Charles IX, grand almoner of Charles IX and Henry III; Charles de Caylus (1704-54), who made his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> a centre of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and whose works in four volumes were condemned by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1754. The Cathedral of St-Etienne of Sens, founded in 972 and rebuilt under Louis VII and <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>, is regarded by several archaeologists as the most ancient of pointed style churches. When in 1241 the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> brought to Sens the Crown of Thorns which St. Louis had obtained from Baldwin II, the king went at the head of a procession to within five leagues of Sens, took the <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a>, and with his brother Robert entered the city barefoot and deposited the <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> in the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church until the Sainte Chapelle of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> was built to receive it. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Auxerre, completed in 1178, contains numerous <a href="13641b.htm">sculptures</a> in the Byzantine style.</p>

<p>The Dioceses of Sens and Auxerre contained illustrious Abbeys; for that of Ferri&egrave;res, located in a region which now depends on the <a href="11318b.htm">Diocese of Orl&eacute;ans</a>, see <a href="06049d.htm">FERRIERES</a>. The Abbey of St-Pierre le Vif dates from the sixth century, but M. Maurice Prou has <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that the diploma of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a> and the testament of "Queen" Th&eacute;odechilde, in the archives of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, lack authenticity. The Th&eacute;odechilde who founded the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was not the daughter of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a> but his granddaughter, the daughter of Thierry first king of Austrasia. The <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> instituted by Rainard, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Pierre le Vif, were celebrated during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The Abbey of St. Columba, the great primitive saint of the City of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, was founded about 590. Her "Passion" dates beyond <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> from the end of the sixth century, in the time of Bishop St. Loup, who translated the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Columba to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> church. It is probable that her <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> took place in the time of <a href="02108b.htm">Aurelian</a>. Her cultus was widespread, extending to <a href="13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, <a href="02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, and <a href="04359b.htm">Cordova</a>. The Acts of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Sts. Sanctian, Augustine, and Beata, companions of St. Columba, seem to date from the end of eighth century or the beginning of the ninth century. In the Abbey of St. Columba, whose third church was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 26 April, 1164, by <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, were buried Raoul, King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and Richard, Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. The Abbey of St. Germain d'Auxerre, founded in 422 by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Germain, in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>, took the name of St. Germain when it was rebuilt by Queen Clotilde about 500. In 850 Abbot Conrad, brother-in-law of Louis the Pious, had <a href="04558a.htm">crypts</a> built in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in which were deposited many bodies of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a> was <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Germain before becoming <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; King Charles VI of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> did not disdain the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of seeing his name inscribed among those of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="04558a.htm">crypts</a> were ravaged by the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> in 1567. The <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> followed the <a href="02436a.htm">Benedictine rule</a>; it was twice reformed, from 995-9 by St. Mayeul of Cluny and his disciple Heldric, and in 1029 by the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of St-Maur.</p>

<p>The Abbey of St-Edmond of <a href="12233a.htm">Pontigny</a>, the second daughter of <a href="03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, was founded in 1114 by Thibaud IV the Great, Count of Champagne. Hugh, Count of <a href="09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, one of the first thirty companions of St. Bernard, was the first <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Louis VII, King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, was its benefactor. St. Thomas &agrave; Becket took refuge at <a href="12233a.htm">Pontigny</a> before seeking shelter at St. Columba's at Sens.  In the thirteenth century Stephen Langton and later St. Edmund, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, also found refuge at <a href="12233a.htm">Pontigny</a>. The <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of St-Michel at Tonnerre was founded about 800 on the site of a hermitage <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the time of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis I</a>; it was restored about 980 by Milo, Count of Tonnerre. In the fifteenth century Cardinal Alanus, <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="03187a.htm">Callistus III</a>, numbered it among the twelve most illustrious <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Gaul. The arrondissement of Avallon, now in the Diocese of Sens, and formerly dependent on the <a href="02144a.htm">Diocese of Autun</a>, possessed the celebrated <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of V&eacute;zelay. It was founded about 860 under the protection of Christ and the Blessed Virgin by Gerard, Count of Roussillon and his wife, <a href="02519a.htm">Bertha</a>; Gerard declared the territory free and dependent only on the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> in 867 and Charles the Bald in 868 confirmed the donation. Eudes, the first <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, offered hospitality to <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, who in, 879 <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the first church of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The Norman invasions laid waste the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but it was restored under Abbot Geoffrey, installed in 1037. Under this <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> the cultus of <a href="09761a.htm">St. Magdalen</a> appeared for the first time at V&eacute;zelay; a letter of <a href="09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> (1050) shows that the name of <a href="09761a.htm">St. Magdalen</a> was part of the official title of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Mgr Duchesne has shown that the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of V&eacute;zelay, at this <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, constructed a first account according to which the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Sts. Maximinus and <a href="09761a.htm">Magdalen</a>, at St-Maximin in Provence, had been opened and their bodies removed to V&eacute;zelay; shortly afterwards a second account relates that there was taken away only the body of <a href="09761a.htm">St. Magdalen</a>. For two centuries the account of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of V&eacute;zelay was accepted; <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of Lucius III, <a href="15211a.htm">Urban III</a>, and <a href="04018a.htm">Clement III</a> confirmed the statement that they possessed the body of <a href="09761a.htm">St. Magdalen</a>. The <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> was visited in the twelfth century by a host of illustrious <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>; "All France", writes Hugh of <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, seems to go to the solemnities of the <a href="09761a.htm">Magdalen</a>."</p>

<p>In 1096 Abbot Artaud, who was later assassinated, had begun the construction of the Basilica of the Madeleine, which was dedicated in 1104 by Paschal II; his successor, Renaud de Semur, later <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, completed it, raised it from its ruins after the great fire of July, 1120, and also built the abbatial chateau. Alberic, a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of Cluny, named <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> by <a href="08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, built in front of the portal the <a href="10704b.htm">narthex</a>, or church of the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, the doorways of which have marvelously wrought archivolts and which was blessed by <a href="08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> in 1132 during his sojourn at V&eacute;zelay; he died a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. Under Abbot Pontius of Montboisier (d. 1161), a former <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of Cluny, V&eacute;zelay emancipated itself from <a href="04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> rule, declared its autonomy as against the claims of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="02144a.htm">Autun</a>, and victoriously resisted the encroachments of the counts of <a href="10778a.htm">Nevers</a>. The second <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> was preached in 1146 by St. Bernard in the abbatial chateau amid such enthusiasm that the assistants tore their garments to make crosses and distribute them to the crowd. Guillaume IV of <a href="10778a.htm">Nevers</a> sought to be revenged on the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of V&eacute;zelay, and his <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a>, L&eacute;thard, defying <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, forced the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> to take flight, but in 1166 Louis arranged a peace between the Comte de Nevers and Abbot Guillaume de Mello. On Pentecost, 1166, St. Thomas &aacute; Becket from the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of V&eacute;zelay pronounced <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> who, to gratify King Henry II had violated the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Louis VII came himself to V&eacute;zelay at epiphany, 1167, to celebrate the reconciliation between the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of V&eacute;zelay and Count Guillaume IV, and in expiation of his crimes Guillaume IV set out for the Holy Land where he died in 1168.</p>

<p>Under the rule of Abbot Girard d'Arcy (1171-96), <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> and <a href="13041b.htm">Richard Coeur de Lion</a> met at V&eacute;zelay in July, 1190, to arrange for the <a href="04543c.htm#section3">Third Crusade</a>. In place of the Romanesque <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> burnt in 1165, Girard had built the choir today admired as one of the most beautiful specimens of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> architecture and falsely attributed to Abbot Hugh, his successor. St. Louis came to V&eacute;zelay in 1267 for a solemn feast organized by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> for the recognition of the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a> and at which Simon de Brion, the future <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>, represented the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>; St. Louis returned here in 1270 on his way to the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>. This benevolence of the kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the constant menace which the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> endured from the counts of <a href="10778a.htm">Nevers</a> led the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of V&eacute;zelay and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to accept the act whereby Philip the Bold in 1280 declared himself protector and guardian of the Abbey. Hugues de Maison-Comte, who became <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> in 1352 and was taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> with John II of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> at the battle of <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, occupied himself after two years of captivity in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> with fortifying the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> against an English attack; he rendered it impregnable and in gratitude Charles V made him a member of the royal council. The claims put forth by the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of Provence, beginning in 1279, that they possessed the body of <a href="09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a> injured the prestige of V&eacute;zelay during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In 1538 a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of secularization sought from <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a> by <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> themselves transformed the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> into a simple collegiate church. Odet de Chatillon, brother of Coligny and <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of V&eacute;zelay, subsequently became a <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>. The <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenot</a> masters of V&eacute;zelay converted the Madeleine into a storehouse and stable and burned the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>. During the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> the ancient <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> buildings were sold at auction. In 1876 the future Cardinal Bernadou, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Sens, determined to restore the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of <a href="09761a.htm">St. Mary Magdalen</a> at V&eacute;zelay and brought thither a <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> which <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> had given to the Chapter of Sens in 1281.</p>
