<p><a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a>; b. probably about 1378 in the District of the Marches; d. probably 1427. The history of this artist has for a long time been involved in mystery, and even <a href="15274a.htm">Vasari's</a> statements concerning him have to be accepted with caution. Of his early life we still <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, but thanks to the investigations of Milanesi, Amico Ricci, and later on of Venturi and Corrado Ricci, we have a few definite facts concerning him. The earliest mention of him is concerned with the decoration of the large council hall in the doges' palace at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, which, it seems clear, must have been carried out between 1411 and 1414, probably in the former year, as the theory set up by Wickhoff, placing the work at a much later date, has now been proved to be untenable. In 1408, however, <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> is known to have <a href="11395a.htm">painted</a> a large <a href="01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> in <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> for Francesco Amadi, and this date implies that he must have been resident in the city for some years previously, because it was not possible for an artist, who had not been born in <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, to be accepted as a member of its <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> or guild, unless resident in the city for some considerable time before he made his application. Between April, 1414, and September, 1419, we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that he was <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a> in <a href="02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, decorating a <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> for Pandolfo Malatesta, and it was on the occasion of the visit which <a href="09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a> made to Malatesta, when he was received at Chiari, that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> invited <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> to pay him a visit in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. We have evidence of the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> on which he set out, because on the 18 September, 1419, he applied for a safe-conduct. There were serious difficulties, however, connected with the early days of the pontificate of <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, and <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> only got as far as Florence, and could not proceed to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Of <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile's</a> residence in Florence we have evidence from the two applications he made, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 23 March, and 6 April, 1420, that he might be relieved from the payment of tribute, inasmuch as he was only temporarily sojourning in <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and was on his way to his native city; but he could not have remained very long in <a href="05744a.htm">Fabriano</a>, because on 21 November, 1422, he figures in the deeds of matriculation connected with the <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> and <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a> of Florence, and in the following year he signs and dates his picture executed to the order of Palla Strozzi for the church of Santa Trinit&egrave; in that city. The evidence that he continued in Florence in 1423 is found in some deeds relating to a curious quarrel which took place between one of <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile's</a> pupils and a certain Bernardo, who threw some stones into the courtyard of the house where <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> was, breaking some small pieces of <a href="13641b.htm">sculpture</a> which happened to be of great value to the artist.</p>

<p>Gentile's work in <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> has usually been assigned to the year 1426, but closer investigation shows that it was carried out in 1425, and a lease of a house in <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> taken for a month by the artist in that year is still in existence, and proves the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the residence of <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> in <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>, and the time that he took to <a href="11395a.htm">paint</a> the picture. It is <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 July, and at the end of August of the same year <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> was in <a href="11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a> in the Duomo, as the archives of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> prove. That work completed, he was at length able to leave for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in 1427 was at work in the church of San Giovanni in Laterano, and the records of his engagement and stipend have been printed. By 22 November, 1428, he was dead, because on that day, according to the evidence of the commune of <a href="05744a.htm">Fabriano</a>, his niece Maddalena took possession of the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of her uncle, who was declared to have died in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> intestate. Further evidence of this date is given by a deed dated October, 1427, in which the master is spoken of as deceased, and these documents prove the inaccuracy of the statements of <a href="15274a.htm">Vasari</a> both as regards the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile's</a> decease and the place where <a href="15274a.htm">Vasari</a> says he died, <a href="03793c.htm">Citt&agrave; di Castello</a>. Amico Ricci and Milanesi were inaccurate in stating that <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> died after 1450, as they were misled by a phrase "autore requisito" which occurs in a document representing the visit of <a href="15269c.htm">Roger van der Weyden</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when he visited San Giovanni in Laterano, and saw the <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> of <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a>. He expressed the greatest admiration for the work, and according to Ricci and Milanesi called the author of the <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> before him. Inasmuch as the visit took place in 1450, these two authors placed <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile's</a> decease after that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, but the phrase refers to the author having died, and this is <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by the two documents just cited.</p>

<p>These few facts practically embrace all that we definitely <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> respecting this artist. He is said to have learned his art under Allegretto Nuzzi. His family name is by some writers given as Maso or Massi, and his burial is said to have taken place in Santa Francesca Romana in the Campo Vaccino, but all these statements are for the present matters of conjecture. He was probably born at <a href="05744a.htm">Fabriano</a> in the <a href="01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, according to the evidence of his name, but Nuzzi is believed to have died when <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> was fifteen years old, and therefore he could have derived very little instruction from Nuzzi. Two of his pictures are <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a>, the "Adoration of the Kings" in the Academy at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1423; and the group of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> in San Nicol&ograve; in the same city, 1425. His best work in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> has perished, but he is well represented in the Brera Gallery in <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, the galleries of <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, Paris, and Berlin; and important pictures in the Heugel collection in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and the Stroganoff collection in St. Petersburg are now accepted as being from his hand. Of his work in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> there is a representation of the <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a> of <a href="11063b.htm">St. Nicholas</a> to be seen in the Vatican Gallery, and part of his work in <a href="11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> still remains. A picture in the royal collection at Buckingham Palace is attributed to him, with considerable evidence in its favour; and his <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> are also to be seen at Settignano, in the municipal gallery at <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and in the Jarves collection at Newhaven in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> but his most important work is the large picture in the Academy in <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, a <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a> of remarkable excellence and extraordinary beauty. In his birthplace there is one picture representing St. Francis, which is probably a genuine work. His <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> are distinguished by great magnificence of colour and marked by his peculiar method of high relief in <em>gesso</em> work, and by the remarkable use he made of small portions of the most brilliant colour, applied in conjunction with masses of gold. He may be accepted as one of the greatest masters of his period, and as a man exceedingly skilful in composition, and full of grand <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> as regards colouring and effect, for in the combination of rich colour with gold he has seldom if ever been equalled amongst decorative <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a>.</p>
