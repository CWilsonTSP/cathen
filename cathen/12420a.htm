<p>Three confraternities of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> &#151; the Apostolic Union, the <a href="12422b.htm">Priests' Eucharistic League</a>, the Priests' Communion League &#151; have reached a stage of unprecedented diffusion throughout the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and receive special treatment elsewhere in this ENCYCLOPEDIA. Confraternities of a local character form the subject of this article. A confraternity is a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> associated for some <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> object. The members are linked together by a bond of brotherhood for mutual co-operation in the pursuit of a specific object of religion or charity by means of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, example, and counsel. This definition will exclude <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> formed for purely scientific or literary work. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> funds of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, even though they include certain religious <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> towards the living and the dead, fall outside its limits. The "Societas pro clero defuncto" is a mutual engagement to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> for the deceased <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of a district; it is an association but not a confraternity. On the other hand the numerous <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> in all parts of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, called by the name of "Monte-pio", will doubtless, many of them, fall under the title of confraternity, on account of the importance assigned to the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of visiting the sick brethren and affording them not only material aid but spiritual consolation, and administering to them the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Two or more of the associates are appointed to visit the sick at least every three days.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>A confraternity of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the strict sense of the word seeks before all else the personal sanctification of its members. Sacerdotal confraternities in different parts of the world present a close family-likeness, their common object being to preserve <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from the dangers of spiritual and social isolation, and to afford them something of that mutual support which belongs to a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> community. "Conjunct&aelig; vires plus valent quam singul&aelig;" is the expression by which the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has recently <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the principle. The particular aims of priests' confraternities may be reduced to three: personal <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> learning, and mutual financial aid. The first two are universal, the third appears occasionally. The religious exercises almost invariably insisted upon are: the half-hour's meditation, Mass with preparation and thanksgiving of fifteen minutes, visit to the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, the devout recitation of the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, <a href="13184b.htm">rosary</a>, weekly confession, monthly recollection, and biennial retreats. Ecclesiastical learning is understood to comprise the study of those subjects which are proper to the various departments of the ministry, and great importance is attached to associated study by means of conferences and discussions. Financial assistance embraces cases of sickness and old age, as well as loans, medical attendance, and legal advice.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Spain</h2>

<p>The uncertainty of the position of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> under a hostile Government has led to the display of considerable activity, of late years in different parts of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in the establishment of the "Monte-pio", an association for the help of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in sickness or old age. Such <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> are to be found in the Dioceses of C&oacute;rdova, Madrid-Alcal&aacute; (founded 1909), and for the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the cities of Valencia (1897), Toledo (1901), Le&oacute;n (1902), Orviedo (1903), Saragossa (1904), Palencia (1905), Astorgia (1906), Urgel (1906), <a href="11295b.htm">Orense</a>, Salamanca (1907), and in the districts of north <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, Ayerbo, and Bolea in <a href="07513a.htm">Huesca</a>. In <a href="06723a.htm">Granada</a> there is the "Refugio de San Pedro Nolasco" under the care of the <a href="02802b.htm">religious of St. John of God</a> for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who by reason of age or infirmity are ordinarily unable to celebrate <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>. Should there be further accommodation after these have been provided for, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> over sixty years of age who are able to celebrate regularly are also admitted. There is a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> for mutual aid in the Diocese of Majorca (established 1846) and Vitoria (1846), also in the cities of San Sebastian and Guernica; another called "La Providenza" is found in the <a href="14459a.htm">Diocese of Tarragona</a>. A brotherhood for mutual assistance in case of illness exists among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the town of <a href="15405a.htm">Vich</a> (1846) in the <a href="02288e.htm">Diocese of Barcelona</a>. Masses are said for all deceased members once a year, and for individual members shortly after death. The co-operative <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> called "The Spanish Clergy Association", established in Ambrona (Soria) for the purchase of provisions, hardly falls within the scope of the present article, nor does the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> now being projected in <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a> by Fr. Armendariz for the vindication of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> from the <a href="03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of the anticlerical press. In Ciudad Real, <a href="03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>, and other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> there exists a brotherhood in which each <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a> for his fellow members. At his death his mass-register is shown to the brotherhood, and if it appears that he has faithfully offered Mass for deceased members, each living member offers a Mass for him. The brotherhoods framed upon the type of the "Associaci&oacute;n de Sacerdotes del Obispado de Ja&eacute;n", under the title of Our Lady of Capilla and St. Euphrasius, dedicate their lives to the apostolate of the working-class in any of the forms required by the present social conditions. They teach <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>; they distribute wholesome literature; they attract the young to confraternities and the practices of religion; and they are always ready for work in the confessional, so as to make it easy for people to approach the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. They hold a day's retreat every month, during which the charitable <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> for the next month are allotted. In case of sickness three of the associates are selected to minister spiritually to the sick brother.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The "Venerable Congregaci&oacute;n de Sacerdotes de San Felipe Neri y Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Presentaci&oacute;n" took its rise under the invocation of St. Philip in the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. James, <a href="15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, as early as the year 1645. Later on the members erected the church of the Oratory, where the congregation is now installed, and in 1609 united with the ancient but languishing confraternity of the Presentation. The personal sanctification of the associates, and as a consequence the greater spiritual profit of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, form the objects of the Institute. Priests and <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> in <a href="11279a.htm">sacred orders</a> are eligible for admission, and on entering take an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity to the rules which prescribe certain religious <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> and in particular visitation of the sick, attendance at the funerals of the brethren, and <a href="04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>. As a type of other forms may be taken the ancient "Hermandad [Brotherhood] de San Pedro de la Ciudad de Xerez". Its aim is the performance of spiritual and corporal works of mercy. The confraternity supplies a legal adviser and two medical <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> at a low fee; moreover, it also provides decent interment for <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> of the brethren, and for <a href="13322a.htm">sacristans</a> who have assisted the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> in its charitable offices. There are likewise brotherhoods of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="13744a.htm">Seville</a>, Puerto de S. Maria, in Santucar de Renameda, Carmina, Ecija, and in the principal cities of <a href="01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>. To these must be added the association of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> entitled "Hermandad de Sacerdotes operarios Diocesanos del Sagrado Coraz&oacute;n de Jes&uacute;s", founded in 1872 by Manuel Domingo y Sol (died 1909). This association, which has received the approval of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, takes charge of the discipline in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, of which it has several in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, one in Mexico, and the Spanish College in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whose late <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, Benjamin D. Mi&ntilde;ana, became superior of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> on the death of the founder.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Portugal</h2>

<p>A confraternity has existed in <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> from the year 1415 with the title of "Veneravel Irmandade dos Clerigos Pobres" under the protection of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> and is now installed in the suppressed <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Martha. It is composed of secular and <a href="12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> in orders. Its chief works are to render special homage to the <a href="15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>, to afford spiritual and temporal succour to the brethren, and to aid primary <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. In 1887 the brotherhood took up the functions of a benefit <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Austria</h2>

<p>Austria possesses several confraternities of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The "Associatio Perseveranti&aelig; Sacerdotalis", founded in 1868 for secular or <a href="12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, has its seat in <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. The aim proposed to members is their sanctification and perseverance. The <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> promotion of devotion to the Sacred Heart is a prominent feature of the association. Much is made of intercourse between members; the anniversary day of <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> is observed with fitting solemnity. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> has a monthly journal called the "Korrespondenz der Associatio" (Vienna). The "Priester-Sodalit&auml;t zum heiligsten Herzen Jesu" of Botzen was established in 1866. Candidates are admitted after a year's probation. The key-note of the association is personal <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> by the thoughtful and reverent discharge of <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>. It supplies a guide to life by fixing a minimum for certain religious exercises likely to be crowded out: thus, meditation, twenty minutes, and when this is impossible its place is to be supplied by spiritual reading or ejaculatory <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>; confession, at least fortnightly; retreat, at least every second year, with three days' recollection other years; preparation for Mass and thanksgiving (fifteen minutes) in the church for example's sake; night <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> with the congregation. Stress is laid on regular application to the studies of the ministry; specialization is encouraged as promoting interest. Other points are: careful preparation of all instructions, <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the work of the confessional, special care of talented boys and of neglected children."Der Marianische Kongregation im Priester-seminar" in Brixen has for its object to foster <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> among its members and to cultivate the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> spirit among the students of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The means insisted on are a <a href="15459a.htm">personal devotion to Our Lady</a>, public devotions with sermons twice a month, and mutual admonition. Its journal is the "Priester-Konferenz-Blatt". At Innsbruck there is a confraternity connected with the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">College</a> entitled "Priestergebetsverein", consisting of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and seminarians in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The essential object of the association is to maintain the bonds of spiritual companionship established in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> when the young <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> leave to take up their pastoral work. The means employed are <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (particularly associated devotion to the Sacred Heart) and correspondence (the periodical of the confraternity being sent to members, and members writing to the committee at least once a year).</p>

<h2 id="section4">France</h2>

<p>A peculiar feature of the "Association des Pr&ecirc;tres s&eacute;culiers du Sacr&eacute;-C&oelig;ur" (Issoudun, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>) is its intimate relation with the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, of whose congregation it is the offspring. "Le soutien d'un pr&ecirc;tre, c'est le pr&ecirc;tre" is the principle which has guided the missionaries in founding an association whereby they may co-operate in the sanctification of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The confraternity was founded in 1858, blessed by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1860, and enriched by him with special favours in 1867 and 1874. In 1882 the roll of the association contained 700 names. At that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> a journal was inaugurated, to be succeeded three years later by the monthly review entitled "Le Sacr&eacute;-C&oelig;ur". Each member under the advice of his director arranges his rule of life with sufficient detail to forestall omissions and yet with a certain elasticity so as not to interfere with <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> [see the "Manuel" (Issoudun), published by the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart].</p>

<h2 id="section5">Rome</h2>

<p>The "Pia Unio S. Pauli Apostoli", established in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, may be accepted as an approved type of a <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> association. It dates back to 1797, when it was instituted as a confraternity of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the corporal and spiritual assistance of sick brethren. With the co-operation of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> the good work extended and ultimately embraced the distinct works of fostering vocations to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the care of the young on festival days, and the holding of discussions on moral subjects. It was reorganized by <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 26 May, 1910, and attached to the church of S. Maria della Pace. The central <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the association is sanctification by the exercise of the sacred ministry. On the <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> side financial aid is given in time of sickness and a loan committee has been projected. Provision is also made for the legal defence of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> when this is desirable.</p>

<h2 id="section6">United States</h2>

<p>The needs of the teeming, active, and diversified population of America have called into being a number of agencies for dealing with the spiritual and social problems which are constantly arising. Mention therefore should be made here of the following <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> of priests: "Association for the Protection of <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> and <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Immigrants"; "Association of the Secular Polish Clergy"; "Catholic Board for Mission Work among the Coloured People"; "The Bureau of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indian Missions"; "Catholic Missionary Union", which provides funds to enable <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to defray the expenses of giving missions to non-Catholics in their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Finally the "Priests' Total Abstinence League" appears to come nearest to the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a confraternity whose central <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is self-sanctification. [See the "Catholic Directory" (Milwaukee, 1910), 725-731.]</p>

<h2 id="section7">Spanish America</h2>

<p>It must suffice here to give the names of several <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in certain districts of South America: <a href="01702d.htm">Argentina</a>, the "Associaci&oacute;n Eclesi&aacute;stica de S. Pedro" with centres at <a href="03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a> and C&oacute;rduba; Colombia, "Asociaci&oacute;n de sufragios del Clero" at Bogota; <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, "Liga Sacerdotal Riograndeza" at <a href="12289c.htm">Porto Alegre</a>. In Mexico there is the "Asociaci&oacute;n del Esp&iacute;ritu Santo" and the "Asociaci&oacute;n de S. Juan Nepomuceno" at <a href="07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>, and the "Asociaci&oacute;n de Socorros mutuos de Cl&eacute;rigos" in the <a href="10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section8">Germany</h2>

<p>In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> almost all the associations for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> have as their object either the cultivation of the ascetical life among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> or the assistance of the members in their temporal necessities. One of the most important of the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> is the "Associatio Perseveranti&aelig; Sacerdotalis" (see III. AUSTRIA). The association has already been introduced into about 27 <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The "Eucharistic Association of the Priests of the Adoration" was founded in 1858 for <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and was canonically erected into a confraternity on 16 January, 1887. Its objects are to foster among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> truly <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> sentiments and a lively <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> and veneration for the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. Each member is to spend each week one hour without intermission in adoration before the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and to celebrate one Mass yearly for deceased members, to whom he is also to apply once monthly the plenary <a href="07783a.htm">indulgence</a> granted for each hour of adoration. The official organ, "S. Eucharistia", is published in six languages; the membership is about 7000 in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Among this class of associations may be also mentioned the "Priesterabstinentenband" (with its organ "Sobrietas") for promoting total abstinence, and the <em>Katechetenvereine</em> in <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, etc.</p>

<p>There are three important associations for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> with the primary object of the rendering of assistance to members in temporal matters. These are;</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(1) the "Priesterverein zur Unterst&uuml;tzung kranker Mitglieder";</li><li>(2) "St. Josephs-Priesterverein" in <a href="06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a>;</li><li>(3) the "Pax".</li></ul></div>

<p>The first, which is essentially an insurance <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, pays to sick <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> three marks daily, provided they have been members for at least one year. The entrance fee varies from 2 marks to over 100 marks according to the age of the applicant; the annual tax is 10 marks. Founded in 1882 it paid 127,192 marks to 513 members in 995 cases of sickness in the first twenty-five years of its existence. The association has almost 1000 members (600 in the <a href="04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>). St. Josephs-Priesterverein in <a href="06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a> (primarily an Austrian association) was founded in 1876 by Mgr Filippi in Meran, and was transferred in 1882 to G&ouml;rs; its object is to secure places in sanatoria for sick <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who need to take a cure to recover their health. The fee for membership is three Kronen yearly (about 60 cents), or a single payment of fifty Kronen. The "Pax", or the "Association of the Catholic Priests of Germany", was founded in 1905 to supply good and cheap insurance for <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporations; the foundation of a pension fund, the affording of legal protection, and the procuring of abatements at sanatoria and hotels are also in contemplation and to some extent attained. Specially favourable terms have been secured from the life insurance company "Concordia", at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and the fire insurance company "Rhineland" at Neuss. Any <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> who takes an insurance with either of these companies becomes thereby a member of the association. The members (about 1500) come from all parts of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, although the southern and eastern <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (except <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>) are not equally well represented. The Polish <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> have founded a separate insurance <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, the "Unitas".</p>
