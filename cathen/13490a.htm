<p>Born at <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, 21 September, 1452; died at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 23 May, 1498. The <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> reformer came from an old <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Intellectually very talented he devoted himself to his studies, and especially to philosophy and medicine. In 1474 while on a journey to <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a> he heard a powerful sermon on repentance by an Augustinian and resolved to renounce the world. He carried out this decision at once and entered the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at Bologna without the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>. Feeling deeply the widespread depravity of the era of the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, as is evident from the poem "On the Decline of the Church", which he wrote in the first year of his monastic life, the young <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> devoted himself with great <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and ascetic practices. In the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Bologna he was entrusted with the instruction of the <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>. He here began to write <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatises based on <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. In 1481 or 1482 he was sent by his superior to preach in <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>. In this centre of the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> he immediately opposed with great energy the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and often immoral life prevalent in many classes of <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> and especially at the court of Lorenzo de Medici. Savonarola's sermons made no impression, for his method and mode of speaking were repulsive to the Florentines; but this did not discourage his reforming <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He preached in the other cities of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> during the years 1485-89. At <a href="02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, in 1486, he explained the Book of Revelation and from that time became more and more absorbed in Apocalyptic <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> concerning his own era, the judgment of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> which threatened it, and the regeneration of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> that was to follow. At the same time he was filled with an intense <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, and was ready to risk all in order to combat wickedness and to spread <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life. In 1489 he returned to Florence which was to be the scene of his future labours and triumphs as well as of his fall.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In August, 1490, Savonarola began his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> in the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of San Marco with the interpretation of the Apocalypse. His success was complete. All Florence thronged to hear him, so that from his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> he acquired a constantly growing influence over the people. In 1491 he became <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Marco. He made manifest his feelings towards the ruler of Florence by failing to visit Lorenzo de Medici, although the <a href="10120a.htm">Medici</a> had always shown themselves generous patrons of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Lorenzo took no notice of this but continued his benefits, without however changing the opinion of the new prior. Savonarola began at once with the inner reform of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> itself. San Marco and other <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> were separated from the Lombard Congregation of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> and were formed in 1493 with <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> approval into an independent congregation. Monastic life was reformed in this new congregation by rigid observance of the original Rule. Savonarola, who was the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the new congregation, set the example of a strict life of <a href="10578b.htm">self-mortification</a>; his cell was small and poor, his clothing coarse, his food simple and scanty. The <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to learn a trade and the <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> were kept constantly at their studies. Many new brethren entered the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>; from 50 the number of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of San Marco rose to 238, among them being members of the first <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of the city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Savonarola preached with burning <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and rapidly won great influence. He was looked upon and <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> by his followers as a <a href="12477a.htm">prophet</a>. His sermons, however were not free from extravagance and vagaries. Without regard to consequences he lashed the immoral, vain-glorious, pleasure-seeking life of the Florentines, so that a very large part of the inhabitants became temporarily contrite and returned to the exercise of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Both his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> and his whole <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> made a deep impression. He bitterly attacked Lorenzo the Magnificent as the promoter of <a href="11388a.htm">paganized</a> art, of frivolous living, and as the tyrant of Florence. Nevertheless, when on his death bed, Lorenzo summoned the stern preacher of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> to administer spiritual consolation to him. It is said that Savonarola demanded as a condition of <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> that Lorenzo restore its liberties to Florence; which, however, the latter refused to do. This however cannot be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> with absolute historical <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>. From 1493 Savonarola spoke with increasing <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> against the abuses in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, against the immorality of a large part of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, above all against the immoral life of many members of the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, even of the wearer of the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a>, <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, and against the wickedness of princes and courtiers. In prophetic terms he announced the approaching judgment of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the avenger from whom he hoped the reform of Church life. By the avenger he meant Charles VIII, King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, who had entered <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was advancing against Florence. Savonarola's denunciation of the <a href="10120a.htm">Medici</a> now produced its results. Lorenzo's son Pietro de Medici, who was <a href="07149b.htm">hated</a> both for his tyranny and his immoral life, was driven out of the city with his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>.</p>

<p>The French king, whom Savonarola at the head of an embassy of <a href="06105c.htm">Florentines</a> had visited at <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, now entered the city. After the king's departure a new and peculiar constitution, a kind of theocratic democracy, was established at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, based on the political and social doctrines the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> had proclaimed. Christ was considered the King of Florence and protector of its liberties. A great council, as the representative of all the citizens, became the governing body of the republic and the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of Christ was to be the basis of political and social life. Savonarola did not interfere directly in politics and affairs of State, but his teachings and his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> were authoritative. The moral life of the citizens was regenerated. Many <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> brought articles of luxury, playing-cards, ornaments, pictures of beautiful <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, the writings of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and immoral poets, etc., to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Marco; these articles were then publicly burned. A brotherhood founded by Savonarola for young people encouraged a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a>, <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life among its members. <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> some of this brotherhood went about from house to house and along the streets to take away dice and cards from the citizens, to exhort luxuriously dressed married and single <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> to lay aside frivolous ornament. Thus there arose an actual police for regulating morality, which also carried on its work by the objectionable methods of spying and denunciation. The principles of the severe judge of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> were carried out in practical life in too extreme a manner. Success made Savonarola, whose speech in his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> was often recklessly passionate, more and more daring. Florence was to be the starting point of the regeneration of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In this respect he was constantly looking for the interposition of Charles VIII for the inner reform of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, although the loose life and vague extravagant <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of this monarch in no way fitted him to undertake such a task.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>These efforts of Savonarola brought him into conflict with <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, like all Italian princes and cities, with the exception of Florence, was an opponent of the French policy. Moreover, Charles VIII had often threatened him with the calling of a reform council in opposition to him. This led <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> to regard all the more dubiously the support that Florence under the influence of Savonarola gave the French king. Furthermore the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> preacher spoke with increasing <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> against the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>. On 25 July, 1495, a <a href="03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> commanded Savonarola in virtue of <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> obedience to come to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and defend himself on the score of the prophecies attributed to him. Savonarola excused himself on the plea of impaired health and of the dangers threatening him. By a further <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 8 September the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> was forbidden to preach, and the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Marco was restored to the Lombard Congregation. In his reply of 29 September, Savonarola sought to justify himself, and declared that, as regards his teaching, he had always submitted to the judgment of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In a new <a href="03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> of 16 October written with great moderation the union of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Marco with the Lombard Congregation was withdrawn, Savanarola's conduct was judged mildly, but the prohibition to preach, until his vindication at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was maintained.</p>

<p>In the meantime Savonarola had again entered the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> on 11 October in order to rouse the Florentines against Pietro de Medici and on 11 February the Signoria of Florence actually commanded the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> to preach again. Savonarola now resumed his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> on 17 February and was thus unjustifiably disobedient to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. In these <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons he <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a> lashed the crimes of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> thereby increasing the passionate excitement at Florence. A <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> threatened and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was again forced to interpose. On 7 November, 1496, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> were formed into a new congregation, the first vicar of which was Cardinal Caraffa. Even then Savonarola refused obedience and again during the <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten season</a> of 1497 preached with uncontrolled <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> against the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 12 May, 1497, he was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Under the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of 19 June he published a letter "against the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>" as being <a href="06249a.htm">fraudulently</a> obtained and sought to show that the judgment against him was null and void. The Florentine ambassadors at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> probably hoped to prevent any further measures on the part of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, but their hopes were unfounded, especially as Savonarola became more defiant. Notwithstanding his <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> he celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> on <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a> and distributed <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. Moreover, disregarding an <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> edict, he began again on 11 February, 1498, to preach at the Cathedral and to demonstrate that the sentences against him were void. Even at this juncture the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> desired to act with gentleness, if the obstinate <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> would submit, but the latter remained defiant and with his adherents set about calling a council in opposition to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. He drew up letters to the rulers of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> urging them to carry out this scheme which, on account of the alliance of the Florentines with Charles VIII, was not altogether beyond possibility.</p>

<p>In Florence itself the opposition to Savonarola grew more powerful, and an adversary from the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> offered to undergo the <a href="11276b.htm">ordeal</a> by fire in order to prove him in <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>. Savonarola himself did not want to take up the challenge, but some of his ardent adherents among the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> declared themselves ready for it. The <a href="11276b.htm">ordeal</a> for both sides was to take place on 7 April, 1498, before a large public gathering. Everything was ready for the test, but it did not take place. The people now turned against Savonarola. There were outbreaks and the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Marco was attacked; Savonarola and a fellow-member of the order, Domenico da Pescia, were taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. The <a href="09118a.htm">papal delegates</a>, the general of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ilerda were sent to Florence to attend the trial. The official proceedings, which were, however, falsified by the notary, still exist. The captured <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were tortured; Savonarola's following in the city fell away. On 22 May, 1498, Savonarola and two other members of the order were condemned to <a href="12565a.htm">death</a> "on account of the enormous crimes of which they had been convicted". They were hanged on 23 May and their bodies burned.</p>

<p>In the beginning Savonarola was filled with <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, and self-sacrifice for the regeneration of <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He was led to offend against these virtues by his fanaticism, obstinacy, and disobedience. He was not a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> in matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. The erection of his <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> at the foot of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> monument at Worms as a reputed "forerunner of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>" is entirely unwarranted. Among his writings mention should be made of: "Triumphus Crucis de fidei veritate" (Florence, 1497), his chief work, an apology for <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; "Compendium revelationum" (Florence, 1495); "Scelta di prediche e scritti", ed. Villari Casanova (Florence, 1898); "Trattato circa il Reggimento di Firenze", ed. Rians (Florence, 1848); further letters edited by Marchese in the "Archivio. storico italiano", App. XIII (1850); poems edited by Rians (Florence, 1847). The "Dialogo della verita" (1497) and fifteen sermons were placed later on the Index.</p>
