<p><a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10413a.htm">Modena</a>, b. at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> 25 Jan., 1509; d. at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1 Dec., 1580. He belonged to a distinguished <a href="10298a.htm">Milanese</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, raised to the nobility in the twelfth century. His father held the dignity of chancellor of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and it was probably to bind the father to his interest that <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> in 1529 named his son Giovanni, then only twenty years of age, to the <a href="10413a.htm">See of Modena</a>. By this appointment great offence was given to Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, who on the pretext that the <a href="10413a.htm">See of Modena</a> had previously been promised to himself, invoked the aid of Duke Alfonso of <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and took forcible possession of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, appropriating all its revenues. The dispute was not settled until 1532, when Morone at last bought off the opposition of d'Este by agreeing to pay him an annual pension of 400 ducats. Even as early as 1529, the young bishop-elect, whose talents had already attracted attention at the <a href="11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>, was chosen by <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> for a diplomatic mission to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Under <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a> Morone's gifts as a negotiator placed him at once in the very front rank of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> politicians. He was sent as <a href="09118a.htm">papal envoy</a> to Duke Sforza of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1535, and in the following year accepted, not altogether without reluctance, the important mission of <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at the court of Ferdinand, King of the Romans. His instructions were to press on the affair of the council in <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. He was to obtain from Ferdinand a safe-conduct for those who intended to take part in it, and to insist upon Mantua or some other Italian city as the place of meeting.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>With the exception of an interval from September, 1538 to July, 1539, and another in 1541, Morone remained at his post in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> for nearly six years, and he was present at the diets of Hagenau in 1540 and <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1541, while at the important meeting of Spiers in 1542 he appeared as the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> special representative, and played a leading part, though even his great tact and resolution were able to do little in the complicated tangle of German religious affairs. During these early years in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and indeed throughout his life, Morone remained a conspicuous member of a little group of moderate and <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> men who saw that in the deadly struggle with <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, the faults were not all on one side. When <a href="13324a.htm">Cardinal Sadoleto</a> in 1537 for addressing a courteously worded appeal to <a href="10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> was denounced by many of his own side as little better than a traitor and a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>, Morone wrote the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> a letter of sympathy. "There are in these parts", he said, "many reputed defenders of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> who think that our religion consists in nothing but <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> . . . . and they are so wedded to this point of view that, without ever looking into the matter itself, they take in bad part not only all negotiations with the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, but every single word spoken about them which is not abusive". Morone further advises <a href="13324a.htm">Sadoleto</a> to treat his critics with silent contempt, and states his own conviction that to show charity to <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> was a better way than to overwhelm them with abusive language, adding: "if only this course had been adopted from the first, there would probably be less difficulty than there is in bringing about the union of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>" (see the letter in "Archiv f. Reformationsgeschichte", 1904, I, 80-81).</p>

<p>On 22 May, 1542, <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a> published his <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, which had been drafted by <a href="13324a.htm">Sadoleto</a>, summoning the <a href="15030c.htm">council</a> to meet at <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a>, on 1 Nov., of the same year. On 2 June, Morone was created a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and on 16 Oct., he and Cardinals Parisio and <a href="12201b.htm">Pole</a> were named <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> to preside over the assembly as the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> representatives. But this first attempt to launch the long-desired council was a failure. Morone went to <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a> and waited until the handful of representatives, who never met in public session, gradually dispersed, the council being formally prorogued 6 July, 1543. Before the assembly was again convened Morone was named <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> (practically <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> governor) at Bologna, and he had nothing to do with the sessions of the <a href="15030c.htm">council</a> which took place at <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a> between December, 1545 and June, 1546, though after the council had been ostensibly transferred to Bologna, he was named by <a href="08564a.htm">Julius III</a> as one of the commissioners to arrange for its return to <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a>. In 1555 he was sent to the Diet of Augsburg, but the death of Julius necessitated his recall and under the Pontificate of <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> Morone, who owing to his wide and liberal views had the misfortune to awaken the <a href="11581a.htm">pope's</a> suspicions when the latter presided over the Roman <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, was arrested by the <a href="11581a.htm">pontiff's</a> order, confined in the Castle of Saint Angelo (31 May, 1557), and made the object of a formal prosecution for <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, in which his views on justification, the invocation of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, the veneration of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> and other matters were incriminated and submitted to rigid inquiry.</p>

<p>The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> strenuously repudiated these charges, but he was kept in confinement until the death of <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>. In 1560 his successor <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> authorized a revision of the process against Morone, and as a result the <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and the whole procedure against him were declared to be entirely without justification; the judgment also recorded in the most formal terms that not the least suspicion rested upon his <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. A few years later when the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> <a href="06635a.htm">Gonzaga</a> and <a href="13729c.htm">Seripando</a> died at <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a>, Morone and Cardinal Navagero were appointed to succeed them, and the former eventually presided over the concluding sessions of the council with conspicuous tact and dignity. He was also placed upon the commission appointed to see that the <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decrees were duly carried into execution. Under the succeeding pontiffs his credit was in no way impaired. He was sent on a mission to <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a> in 1575, and in 1576 was appointed to attend the Diet of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. As Cardinal Protector of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, Morone in 1578-1579 had much to do with the administration of the English College (see <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Record Society, "Miscellanea", II, London, 1906); and when he died he had been for some time <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. Few <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in that century were so successful in retaining the esteem of men of all parties and all creeds as this large-minded and eminently able and honest churchman. His reports as <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, recently published of late years in the German series of "Nuntiaturberichten", throw a flood of light upon the religious conditions of the empire, and it is interesting to note that the "Claudius internuntius" whose letters were so often turned to good account by <a href="12672b.htm">Raynaldi</a> proves to be no other than Morone himself (see Ehses in "R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift", 1903). It may be mentioned in conclusion that Morone had much to do with the founding of the important Collegium Germanicum in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a work in which he was closely associated with <a href="07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>.</p>
