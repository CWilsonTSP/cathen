<p>Sixth Bishop and second <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Philadelphia, b. At Thurles, County Tipperary, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 20 February, 1831; d. At Philadelphia; 11 February, 1911. His early <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> was received at the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> in his native town. In his twelfth year he entered the select <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of Mr. J. L. Naughton, Richmond Street, <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, where he began his Classical studies. In 1844, while a pupil at Mr. Naughton's <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, he headed a delegation of students, and in their name made an address to Daniel O'Connell, then a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in Richmond Bridewell Prison. It is said that the great Liberator complimented the young speaker, and predicted a brilliant future for him. In 1847 he was adopted for the Diocese of St. Louis in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> by <a href="08618a.htm">Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick</a> and entered St. Patrick's College, Carlow. In 1852 he finished his course and was advanced to <a href="04647c.htm">deacon's</a> orders, but being too young to be <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, he set out for St. Louis with Rev. Patrick Feehan, a subject of the same diocese, and afterward <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and on his arrival was appointed to teach in the Diocesan Seminary at Carondelet. On account of his exceptional ability as a public speaker, <a href="08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> permitted. the young <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> to preach frequently in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His fame went forth at once, and he drew large audiences, made up not only of the regular members of the congregation, but of the most prominent people of all <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> from various parts of the city and more distant points. On 8 September, 1853, by special <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and was appointed assistant <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He served there as assistant and as <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> until 1861, when he was appointed to build the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Annunciation at St. Louis. Having completed this task promptly and successfully, he was transferred to the rectorship of St. John's parish, at St. Louis. During all these years he was noted for his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the work of the ministry, for his faithfulness in attending the military <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a> in Gratiot Street Prison during the Civil War, for the frequency and effectiveness of his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>, and for the large number of converts, many of them <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of note, who by his influence were brought into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1866 he attended the <a href="02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> as one of <a href="08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick's</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and was one of three <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> chosen to preach on that occasion, the others being Archbishop John Lancaster Spalding, and the late <a href="07186a.htm">Rev. Isaac Hecker, C.S.P.</a> In 1868 he spent a year in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> with <a href="08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a>. His fame as an orator had preceded him, and he received calls from all sides. At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, at the request of <a href="12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, he delivered the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> course for that year. <a href="08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> appointed him <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and administrator of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, during his attendance at the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. On 14 February, 1872, he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15041b.htm">Tricomia</a>, and Coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Louis with right of succession. After serving faithfully and successfully in this capacity for twelve years, he was made titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13393a.htm">Salamis</a> on 6 January, 1884.</p>

<p>In the meantime the See of Philadelphia had become <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> by the death of Archbishop Wood, and on 8 June, 1884, Archbishop Ryan was appointed to succeed him. During his reign in Philadelphia the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> grew rapidly, as can be seen by the following table:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Churches &mdash; 127 in 1884; 297 in 1911</li><li>Priests &mdash; 260 in 1884; 582 in 1911</li><li>Nuns &mdash; 1020 in 1884; 2565 in 1911</li><li>Schools &mdash; 59 in 1884; 141 in 1911</li><li>Pupils &mdash; 22,000 in 1884; 66,612 in 1911</li><li>Orphans supported &mdash; 998 in 1884; 3,230 in 1911</li><li><a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population &mdash; 300,000 in 1884; 525,000 in 1911 </li></ul></div>

<p>During that time also the Roman <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> High School for Boys, which was endowed by Mr. Thomas Cahill, was built, and put in operation; high school centres for girls taught by the different communities were established; a new central high school for girls was partly endowed and begun; St. Francis' Industrial School for Boys was endowed and successfully operated, the Philadelphia Protectory for Boys was erected: it has since been enlarged, at a cost of over half a million dollars and with capacity for six hundred; St. Joseph's Home for Working Boys was founded; a new <a href="06159a.htm">foundling asylum</a> and maternity <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> was built; a new St. Vincent's Home for younger <a href="11322b.htm">orphan</a> children was purchased with the archbishop's Golden Jubilee Fund of $200,000; a third Home for the Aged was erected; a Memorial Library Building, dedicated to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, was begun at St. Charles' Seminary, Overbrook; and the three <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of the city doubled their capacity. The extent of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> is shown by his care for the emigrants who came into the diocese during his time. In 1884 there were very few foreign churches in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; now there are 20 for the <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a>, 23 for the Poles, 18 for the Greeks, 15 for the Slovacs, 6 for the Lithuanians, and several for other nationalities.</p>

<p>The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> took special interest in the Indians and <a href="12627a.htm">negroes</a>. He established two congregations for the latter in Philadelphia, and invited the Holy Ghost Fathers to build their college and mother-house at Cornwells, near the city. Under his direction Mother Katharine Drexel founded the <a href="02599a.htm">Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</a>, who devote themselves entirely to the Indians and <a href="12627a.htm">negroes</a>, with their mother-house, <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> at Cornwells and several <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in the West and South. Another <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of this interest is found in the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> attendance at the Lake Mohonk conferences, and at the meetings of the U. S. Indian Commission, to which he had been appointed by President Roosevelt. By his <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and tact he removed much prejudice against the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and obtained special privileges for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in public institutions. His great reputation as an orator brought him invitations to speak, not only at the most important <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions, but also on secular occasions. In addition to his monthly sermons, in St. Louis on the first <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a>, and in Philadelphia on the second, he preached frequently at the laying of corner-stones, at the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and churches, and at funerals. Some of the more remarkable instances were the dedication of St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, the conferring of the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> on <a href="04395a.htm">Archbishop Corrigan</a>, and his funeral sermon; the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> and funeral of Archbishop Hennessy of <a href="05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, and the funeral of <a href="08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> of St. Louis. He addressed the St. Louis Legislature twice; opened the St. Louis University on two occasions; spoke before the Committee of the United States Senate on Indian affairs; opened the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia in 1900, and was the principal speaker at the McKinley Memorial service in Philadelphia, after the president's assassination.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>He lectured on various occasions, the most important of his lectures probably being on "What Catholics do not believe", St. Louis, 1877, and on "Agnosticism", Philadelphia, 1894. He received the degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of St. Louis and from the University of <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Under his guidance the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "Standard and Times" of Philadelphia, his official organ, obtained a reputation unexcelled in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism; and under his editorial direction the "American <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Quarterly Review" preserved and extended the reputation which it had already made as a leading exponent of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> thought. The celebrations of the Silver Jubilee of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in the <a href="02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, 1897, and of his Golden Jubilee in the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, 1903, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> the esteem in which he was held by the whole community, irrespective of creed, because the whole city rejoiced; while his death showed how universally he was <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a>, for the whole city wept. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was best known as an orator and a wit. He was adorned most by strong <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, by great meekness and <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>, and by a <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> that was far-reaching and admirable. He has left no published works except some lectures. These are: "Modern Religious Skepticism"; "What <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> do not Believe"; "Christian Civilization", and "Agnosticism": all are published by the <a href="15077a.htm">Catholic Truth Society</a> of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> as well as by similar organizations in this country and <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. There is a fifth lecture on "Religion and the Fine Arts".</p>
