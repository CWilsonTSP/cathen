<p>The restoration of <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> from the bondage of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> to the liberty of the children of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> through the satisfactions and <a href="10202b.htm">merits</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>The word <em>redemptio</em> is the <a href="15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> rendering of Hebrew <em>kopher</em> and Greek <em>lytron</em> which, in the <a href="12681a.htm">Old Testament</a> means generally a ransom-price. In the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, it is the classic term designating the "great price" (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs20">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>) which the Redeemer paid for our liberation. Redemption presupposes the original elevation of <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> to a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> state and his downfall from it through <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>; and inasmuch as <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> calls down the wrath of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and produces man's servitude under <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a>, Redemption has reference to both <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and man. On <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> part, it is the acceptation of satisfactory amends whereby the Divine <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> is repaired and the Divine wrath appeased. On man's part, it is both a deliverance from the slavery of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and a restoration to the former <a href="01148a.htm">Divine adoption</a>, and this includes the whole process of <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life from the first reconciliation to the final <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>. That double result, namely <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> satisfaction and man's restoration, is brought about by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> vicarious office working through satisfactory and <a href="10202b.htm">meritorious</a> actions performed in our behalf.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Need of redemption</h2>

<p>When <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> came, there were throughout the world a deep consciousness of moral depravation and a vague longing for a restorer, pointing to a universally felt need of rehabilitation (see Le Camus, "Life of Christ", I, i). From that subjective sense of need we should not, however, hastily conclude to the objective necessity of Redemption. If, as is commonly held against the Traditionalist School, the low moral condition of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> under <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> or even under the <a href="10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a> is, in itself, apart from revelation no <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> positive of the existence of <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>, still less could it necessitate Redemption. Working on the data of Revelation concerning both <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> and Redemption, some <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, like St. Athanasius (De incarnatione, in P.G., XXV, 105), <a href="04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (Contra Julianum in P.G., LXXV, 925) and <a href="08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (De fide orthodoxa, in P. G, XCIV, 983), so emphasized the fitness of Redemption as a remedy for <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> as almost to make it appear the sole and <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> means of rehabilitation. Their sayings, though qualified by the oft-repeated statement that Redemption is a <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> work of mercy, probably induced <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> (Cur Deus homo, I) to pronounce it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the hypothesis of <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>. That view is now commonly rejected, as <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> was by no means bound to rehabilitate fallen <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Even in the event of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> decreeing, out of his own free volition, the rehabilitation of man, <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> point out other means besides Redemption, v.g. Divine condonation pure and simple on the sole condition of man's repentance, or, if some measure of satisfaction was required, the mediation of an exalted yet created interagent. In one hypothesis only is Redemption, as described above, deemed absolutely <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> and that is if <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> should demand an adequate compensation for the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a>. The juridical axiom "honor est in honorante, injuria in injuriato" (honour is measured by the dignity of him who gives it, offence by the dignity of him who receives it) shows that mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> bears in a way an <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> malice and that nothing short of a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> possessing <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> worth is capable of making full amends for it. True, it has been suggested that such a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> might be an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> <a href="07610b.htm">hypostatically united</a> to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, but, whatever be the merits of this notion in the abstract, <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> practically disposes of it with the remark that "both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one" (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#vrs11">Hebrews 2:11</a>), thus pointing to the <a href="08374c.htm">God-Man</a> as the real Redeemer.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Mode of redemption</h2>

<p>The real redeemer is <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who, according to the Nicene creed, "for us men and for our <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> descended from <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary and became man. He was also crucified for us, suffered under <a href="12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> and was buried". The energetic words of the Greek text [<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, n. 86 (47)], <em>enanthropesanta, pathonta</em>, point to <a href="07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and sacrifice as the groundwork of Redemption. <a href="07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> &mdash; that is, the personal union of the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> with the Second Person of the <a href="15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> &mdash; is the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> basis of Redemption because this, in order to be efficacious, must include as attributions of the one Redeemer both the humiliation of man, without which there would be no satisfaction, and the dignity of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, without which the satisfaction would not be adequate. "For an adequate satisfaction", says <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the act of him who satisfies should possess an <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> value and proceed from one who is both <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and Man" (<a href="../summa/4001.htm#article2">III:1:2 ad 2um</a>). Sacrifice, which always carries with it the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of suffering and immolation (see Lagrange, "Religions semitiques", 244), is the complement and full expression of <a href="07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. Although one single theandric operation, owing to its <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> worth, would have sufficed for Redemption, yet it pleased the Father to demand and the Redeemer to offer His labours, passion, and death (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs17">John 10:17-18</a>). St. Thomas (<a href="../summa/4046.htm#article6">III:46:6 ad 6um</a>) remarks that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> wishing to liberate man not only by way of power but also by way of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, sought both the high degree of power which flows from His <a href="06608a.htm">Godhead</a> and the maximum of suffering which, according to the human standard, would be considered sufficient satisfaction. It is in this double light of <a href="07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and sacrifice that we should always view the two concrete factors of Redemption, namely, the satisfaction and the merits of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3 id="A">Satisfaction of Christ</h3>

<p>Satisfaction, or the payment of a <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> in full, means, in the moral order, an acceptable reparation of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> offered to the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> offended and, of course, implies a penal and painful work. It is the unmistakable teaching of Revelation that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> offered to His heavenly Father His labours, sufferings, and death as an <a href="02055a.htm">atonement</a> for our <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>. The classical passage of Isaias (<a href="../bible/isa052.htm">52</a>-<a href="../bible/isa053.htm">53</a>), the <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> character of which is recognized by both Rabbinical interpreters and <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writers (see Condamin, "Le livre d'Isaie" <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1905), graphically describes the servant of <a href="08329a.htm">Jahveh</a>, that is the <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a>, Himself innocent yet chastized by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, because He took our iniquities upon Himself, His self-oblation becoming our peace and the sacrifice of His life a payment for our transgressions. The <a href="14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> proposes Himself as a model of self-sacrificing <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> because He "is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a redemption for many" (<em>lytron anti pollon</em>) (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs28">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="../bible/mar010.htm#vrs45">Mark 10:45</a>). A similar declaration is repeated on the eve of the Passion at the <a href="14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>: "Drink ye all of this. For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs27">Matthew 26:27, 28</a>). In view of this and of the very explicit assertion of St. Peter (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs11">1 Peter 1:11</a>) and St. John (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs2">1 John 2:2</a>) the <a href="10415a.htm">Modernists</a> are not justified in contending that "the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> expiatory death is not evangelic but Pauline" (prop. xxxviii condemned by the Holy Office in the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili" 3 July, 1907). Twice (<a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs23">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>, <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs3">15:3</a>) <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> disclaims the authorship of the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>. He is, however, of all the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writers, the best expounder of it. The redeeming sacrifice of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the theme and burden of the whole Epistle to the Hebrews' and in the other Epistles which the most exacting critics regard as surely Pauline, there is all but a set theory. The main passage is <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs23">Romans 3:23 sq.</a>: "For all have <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and do need the glory of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, Whom <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> hath proposed to be a propitiation, through <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in his blood, to the shewing of his <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, for the remission of former <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>." Other texts, like <a href="../bible/eph002.htm#vrs16">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs20">Colossians 1:20</a>; and <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs13">Galatians 3:13</a>, repeat and emphasize the same teaching. The early Fathers, engrossed as they were by the problems of <a href="14597a.htm">Christology</a> have added but little to the soteriology of the Gospel and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. It is not <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, however, to say with <a href="13086a.htm">Ritschl</a> (" Die christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versohnung", Bonn, 1889), Harnack ("Precis de l'histoire des dogmes", tr. <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1893), Sabatier ("La doctrine de l'expiation et son evolution historique", Paris, 1903) that they viewed Redemption only as the deification of humanity through <a href="07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> vicarious satisfaction. "An impartial inquiry", says Riviere, "clearly shows two tendencies: one idealistic, which views <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> more as the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> restoration of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> to an <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a> and Divine life, the other realistic, which considers it rather as the expiation of our <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> through the death of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The two tendencies run side by side with an occasional contact, but at no time did the former completely absorb the latter, and in course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, the realistic view became preponderant" (Le dogme de la redemption, p. 209). St. Anselm's famous treatise "Cur Deus homo" may be taken as the first systematic presentation of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Redemption, and, apart from the exaggeration noted above, contains the synthesis which became dominant in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. Far from being adverse to the <em>satisfactio vicaria</em> popularized by <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, the early <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> accepted it without question and even went so far as to suppose that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> endured the pains of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> in our place. If we except the erratic views of <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, <a href="14113a.htm">Socinus</a> (d. 1562) in his "de Deo servatore" was the first who attempted to replace the traditional <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> vicarious satisfaction by a sort of purely <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> exemplarism. He was and is still followed by the <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalist</a> School which sees in the traditional theory all but <a href="04675b.htm">defined</a> by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, a spirit of vindictiveness unworthy of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and a subversion of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> in substituting the innocent for the guilty. The charge of vindictiveness, a piece of gross <a href="01558c.htm">anthropomorphism</a>, comes from confounding the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> of revenge and the virtue of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. The charge of <a href="08010c.htm">injustice</a> ignores the fact that <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the juridical head of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs22">Ephesians 1:22</a>), <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> offered Himself (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs15">John 10:15</a>), that we might be saved by the grace of one Saviour even as we had been lost by the fault of the one Adam (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs15">Romans 5:15</a>). It would be a crude conception indeed to suppose that the guilt or culpability of men passed from the consciences of men to the <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>: the penalty alone was <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> assumed by the Redeemer and, in paying it, He washed away our <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and restored us to our former <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> state and destination.</p>

<h3 id="B">Merits of Christ</h3>

<p>Satisfaction is not the only object and value of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> theandric operations and sufferings; for these, beside placating <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, also benefit man in several ways. They possess, in the first place, the power of impetration or intercession which is proper to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, according to <a href="../bible/joh011.htm">John 11:42</a>: "And I <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> that thou hearest me always." However, as satisfaction is the main factor of Redemption with regard to <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, so man's restoration is due principally to the merits of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. That merit, or the quality which makes <a href="01115a.htm">human acts</a> worthy of a reward at the hands of another, attaches to the works of the Redeemer, is apparent from the easily ascertained presence in them of the usual conditions of merit, namely</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the wayfarer state (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs14">John 1:14</a>);</li><li>moral liberty (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs18">John 10:18</a>);</li><li>conformity to the <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> standard (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs29">John 8:29</a>); and</li><li>Divine promise (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#vrs10">Isaiah 53:10</a>).</li></ul></div>

<p><a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> merited for Himself, not indeed grace nor essential glory which were both attached and due to the <a href="07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a>, but accidental <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#vrs9">Hebrews 2:9</a>) and the exaltation of His name (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs9">Philippians 2:9-10</a>). He also merited for us. Such Biblical phrases as to receive "of his fulness" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs16">John 1:16</a>), to be <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a> with His <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a> (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs3">Ephesians 1:3</a>), to be made alive in Him (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs22">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>), to owe Him our <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#vrs9">Hebrews 5:9</a>) clearly imply a communication from Him to us and that at least by way of merit. The <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> [Decretum pro Jacobitis, <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, n. 711 (602)] credits man's deliverance from the domination of <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a> to the merit of the Mediator, and the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. V, cc. iii, vii, xvi and canons iii, x) repeatedly connects the merits of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the development of our <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life in its various phases. Canon iii of Session V says <a href="01455e.htm">anathema</a> to whoever claims that <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> is cancelled otherwise than by the merits of one Mediator, <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and canon x of Session VI defines that man cannot merit without the <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> through which <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> merited our justification.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The objects of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> merits for us are the <a href="06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a> lost by <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, that is, grace (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs14">John 1:14-16</a>) and <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs22">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>); the preternatural gifts enjoyed by our <a href="01129a.htm">first parents</a> in the state of innocence are not, at least in this world, restored by the merits of Redemption, as <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> wishes us to suffer with Him in order that we may be glorified with Him (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs17">Romans 8:17</a>). <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> explaining how <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> merits pass on to us, says: <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> merits for others as other men in the state of grace merit for themselves (<a href="../summa/4048.htm#article1">III:48:1</a>). With us merits are essentially personal. Not so with <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> who, being the head of our race (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs15">Ephesians 4:15</a>-<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#vrs23">5:23</a>), has, on that score, the unique prerogative of communicating to the subordinate personal members the Divine life whose source He is. "The same motion of the Holy Ghost", says Schwalm, "which impels us individually through the various stages of grace toward life eternal, impels <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> but as the leader of all; and so the same law of efficacious Divine motion governs the individuality of our merits and the universality of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> merits" (Le Christ, 422). It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that the Redeemer associates others to Himself "For the perfecting of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, . . . for the edifying of the <a href="10663a.htm">body of Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs12">Ephesians 4:12</a>), but their subordinate merit is only a matter of fitness and creates no right, whereas <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on the sole ground of His dignity and mission can claim for us a participation in His Divine privileges.</p>

<p>All admit, in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> meritorious actions, a moral influence moving <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to confer on us the grace through which we merit. Is that influence merely moral or does it effectively concur in the production of grace? From such passages as <a href="../bible/luk006.htm">Luke 6:19</a>, "virtue went out from him", the <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> insist much on the <em>dynamis zoopoios</em> or <em>vis vivifica</em>, of the Sacred Humanity, and <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/4048.htm#article6">III:48:6</a>) speaks of a sort of <em>efficientia</em> whereby the actions and passions of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as vehicle of the Divine power, cause grace by way of instrumental force. Those two modes of action do not exclude each other: the same act or set of acts of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> may be and probably is endowed with twofold efficiency, meritorious on account of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> personal dignity, dynamic on account of His investment with Divine power.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Adequacy of redemption</h2>

<p>Redemption is styled by the <a href="13120c.htm">"Catechism of the Council of Trent"</a> (1, v, 15) "complete, integral in all points, perfect and truly admirable". Such is the teaching of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>: "where <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, grace did more abound" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs20">Romans 5:20</a>), that is, <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> as the effects of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> are, they are more than compensated by the fruits of Redemption. Commenting on that passage <a href="08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (Hom. X in Rom., in P.G., LX, 477) compares our liability to a drop of water and <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> payment to the vast ocean. The <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> reason for the adequacy and even superabundance of Redemption is given by <a href="04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a>: "One died for all . . . but there was in that one more value than in all men together, more even than in the whole creation, for, beside being a perfect man, He remained the only <a href="14142b.htm">son of God</a>" (Quod unus sit Christus, in P.G., LXXV, 135fi). <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> (Cur Deus homo, II, xviii) is probably the first writer who used the word "infinite," in connection with the value of Redemption: "ut sufficere possit ad solvendum quod pro peccatis totius mundi debetur et plus in infinitum". This way of speaking was strongly opposed by <a href="05194a.htm">John Duns Scotus</a> and his <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> on the double plea that the Humanity of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> is finite and that the qualification of <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> would make all <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> actions equal and place each of them on the same level with His sublime surrender in the Garden and on Calvary. However the word and the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> passed into current <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and were even officially adopted by <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> (Extravag. Com. Unigenitus, V, IX, 2), the reason given by the latter, "propter unionem ad Verbum", being the identical one adduced by the Fathers.</p>

<p>If It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that; according to the axiom "actiones sunt suppositorum", the value of actions is measured by the dignity of the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who performs them and whose expression and coefficient they are, then the theandric operations must be styled and are <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> because they proceed from an <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>. <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus's</a> theory wherein the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> intrinsic worth of the theandric operations is replaced by the extrinsic acceptation of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, is not altogether <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> against the charge of <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> leveled at it by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> like <a href="13592a.htm">Schwane</a> and <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> like Harnack. His arguments proceed from a double confusion between the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> and the nature, between the agent and the objective conditions of the act. The Sacred Humanity of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> is, no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> the immediate principle of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> satisfactions and merits, but that principle (<em>principium quo</em>) being subordinate to the Person of the Word (<em>principium quod</em>), borrows from it the ultimate and fixed value, in the present case <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>, of the actions it performs. On the other hand, there is in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> actions, as in our own, a double aspect, the personal and the objective: in the first aspect only are they uniform and equal while, viewed objectively, they must needs vary with the nature, circumstances, and finality of the act.</p>

<p>From the adequacy and even superabundance of Redemption as viewed in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ our Head</a>, it might be inferred that there is neither need nor use of personal effort on our part towards the performance of satisfactory works or the acquisition of merits. But the inference would be fallacious. The <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of cooperation, which obtains all through the providential order, governs this matter particularly. It is only through, and in the measure of, our co-operation that we appropriate to ourselves the satisfactions and merits of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. When <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, after denying human liberty on which all <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> rest, was driven to the makeshift of "fiducial <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>" as the sole means of appropriating the fruits of Redemption, he not only fell short of, but also ran counter to, the plain teaching of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> calling upon us to deny ourselves and carry our cross (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs24">Matthew 16:24</a>), to walk in the footsteps of the Crucified (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs21">1 Peter 2:21</a>), to suffer with <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> in order to be glorified with Him (Rom. viii, 17), in a word to fill up those things that are wanting to the sufferings of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs24">Colossians 1:24</a>). Far from detracting from the perfection of Redemption, our daily efforts toward the imitation of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> are the test of its efficacy and the fruits of its fecundity. "All our glory", says the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, "is in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> in whom we live, and merit, and satisfy, doing worthy fruits of penance which from Him derive their virtue, by Him are presented to the Father, and through Him find acceptance with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" (Sess. XIV, c. viii)</p>

<h2 id="section4">Universality of redemption</h2>

<p>Whether the effects of Redemption reached out to the <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> world or to the earthly <a href="14519a.htm">paradise</a> is a disputed point among <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a>. When the question is limited to fallen man it has a clear answer in such passages as I John, ii, 2; <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs4">1 Timothy 2:4</a> and <a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#vrs10">4:10</a>; <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs16">2 Corinthians 5:16, etc.</a>; all bearing out the Redeemer's intention to include in His saving work the universality of men without exception. Some apparently restrictive texts like <a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs28">Matthew 20:28</a> and <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs28">26:28</a>; Rom., v, 15; <a href="../bible/heb009.htm#vrs28">Hebrews 9:28</a>, where the words "many" (<em>Multi</em>), "more" (<em>plures</em>), are used in reference to the extent of Redemption, should be interpreted in the sense of the Greek phrase <em>no pollon</em>, which means the generality of men, or by way of comparison, not between a portion of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> included in, and another left out of, Redemption, but between Adam and <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In the determination of the many problems that arose from time to time in this difficult matter, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was guided by the principle laid down in the Synod of Quierzy [<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a> n. 319 (282)] and the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> [Sess. VI, c. iii, <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, n. 795 (677)] wherein a sharp line is drawn between the power of Redemption and its actual application in particular cases. The universal power has been maintained against the <a href="12376b.htm">Predestinarians</a> and <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> who limited Redemption to the <a href="12378a.htm">predestinated</a> (cf. the councils named above), and against the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> who restricted it to the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> or those who actually come to <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> [prop. 4 and 5, condemned by <a href="01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a>, in <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 1294-5 (1161-2)] and the latter's contention that it is a <a href="13703a.htm">Semi-Pelagian</a> <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> to say that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> died for all men has been declared <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> [<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, n.1096 (970)].</p>

<p>The opinion of Vasquez and a few <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, who placed children dying without <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> outside the pale of Redemption, is commonly rejected in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. In such cases no tangible effects of Redemption can be shown, but this is no reason for pronouncing them outside the redeeming virtue of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. They are not excluded by any Biblical text. Vasquez appeals to <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs3">1 Timothy 2:3-6</a>, to the effect that those children, not having any means or even possibility to come to the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, do not seem to be included in the saving will of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. If applied to infants at all, the text would exclude likewise those who, as a matter of fact, receive <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. It is not likely that Redemption would seek adults laden with personal <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and omit infants labouring under <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> only. Far better say with <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>: "Numquid parvuli homines non sunt, ut non pertineat ad eos quod dictum est: vult omnes salvos fieri?" (Contra Julianum, IV, xiii). With regard to the <em>de facto</em> application of Redemption in particular cases, it is subject to many conditions, the principal being human liberty and the general <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> which govern the world both natural and <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. The Universalists' contention that all should finally be saved lest Redemption be a failure is not only unsupported by, but also opposed to, the New Dispensation which far from suppressing the general <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the natural order, places in the way of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> many indispensable conditions or <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of a freely established <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. Neither should we be moved by the reproaches of failure often flung at Redemption on the plea that, after nineteen centuries of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, a comparatively small portion of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> has heard the voice of the Good Shepherd (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs16">John 10:16</a>) and a still smaller fraction has entered the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> fold. It was not within <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> plan to illumine the world with the light of the Incarnate Word at once, since he waited thousands of years to send the Desired of the Nations. The <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of progress which obtain everywhere else govern also the <a href="08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. We have no criterion whereby we can tell with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> the success or failure of Redemption, and the mysterious influence of the Redeemer may reach farther than we think in the present as it certainly has a retroactive effect upon the past. There can be no other meaning to the very comprehensive terms of Revelation. The <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> accorded by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to the countless generations preceding the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> era, whether <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="11388a.htm">Pagans</a>, were, by anticipation, the <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> of Redemption. There is little sense in the trite dilemma that Redemption could benefit neither those who were already saved nor those who were forever lost, for the just of the <a href="10582c.htm">Old Law</a> owed their <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the anticipated merits of the coming <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> and the damned lost their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> because they spurned the <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> of illumination and good will which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> granted them in prevision of the saving works of the Redeemer.</p>

<h2 id="section5">Title and offices of the Redeemer</h2>

<p>Besides the names <a href="08374x.htm">Jesus</a>, Saviour, Redeemer, which directly express the work of Redemption, there are other titles commonly attributed to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> because of certain functions or offices which are either implied in or connected with Redemption, the principal being Priest, Prophet, King and Judge.</p>

<h3>Priest</h3>

<p>The <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> office of the Redeemer is thus described by <a href="09604b.htm">Manning</a> (The Eternal Priesthood, 1):</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the Priesthood of the Incarnate Son? It is the office He assumed for the Redemption of the world by the oblation of Himself in the vestment of our manhood. He is Altar, Victim and Priest by an eternal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Himself. This is the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> forever after the order of Melchisedek who was without beginning of days or end of life &mdash; a type of the eternal <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the <a href="14142b.htm">son of God</a>. </p></blockquote>

<p>As sacrifice, if not by the nature of things, at least by the positive ordinance of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, is part of Redemption, the Redeemer must be a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, for it is the function of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> to offer sacrifice. In an endeavour to induce the newly converted <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> to abandon the defective Aaronic <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and to cling to the <a href="08374c.htm">Great High Priest</a> who entered <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in his Epistle to the Hebrews, extols the dignity of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> office. His <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> took place, not from all <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> and through the procession of the Word from the Father, as some of the <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> seem to imply, but in the fulness of time and through the <a href="07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>, the mysterious unction which made Him <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> being none else than the <a href="07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a>. His great sacrificial act was performed on Calvary by the oblation of Himself on the Cross, is continued on earth by the <a href="10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> and consummated in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> through the sacrificial intention of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and the <a href="15714a.htm">glorified wounds</a> of the <a href="08374c.htm">victim</a>. The <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, to which is committed the <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of the mysteries of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, is not a substitute for, but the prolongation of, the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>: He continues to be the offerer and the oblation; all that the <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and consecrating <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> do in their ministerial capacity, is to "show forth the death of the Lord" and apply the merits of His Sacrifice.</p>

<h3>Prophet</h3>

<p>The title of Prophet applied by Moses (<a href="../bible/deu018.htm#vrs15">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>) to the coming <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> and recognized as a valid claim by those who heard <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs10">Luke 7:10</a>), means not only the foretelling of future events, but also in a general way the mission of teaching men in the name of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a Prophet in both senses. His prophecies concerning Himself, His disciples, His <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the Jewish nation, are treated in manuals of <a href="01618a.htm">apologetics</a> (see McIlvaine, "Evidences of Christianity", lect. V-VI, Lescoeur, "J&eacute;sus-Christ", 12e conf&eacute;er.: Le Proph&egrave;te). His teaching power (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs29">Matthew 7:29</a>), a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> attribute of His Divinity, was also an integrant part of Redemption. He who came "to seek and to save that which was lost" (<a href="../bible/luk019.htm#vrs10">Luke 19:10</a>) should possess every quality, Divine and human, that goes to make the efficient teacher. What Isaias (<a href="../bible/isa055.htm#vrs4">55:4</a>) foretold, "Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, for a leader and a master to the Gentiles", finds its full realization in the history of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. A perfect <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the things of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and of man's needs, Divine authority and human sympathy, precept and example combine to elicit from all generations the praise bestowed on Him by His hearers &mdash; "never did man speak like this man" (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs46">John 7:46</a>).</p>

<h3>King</h3>

<p>The kingly title frequently bestowed on the <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> by the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> writers (<a href="../bible/psa002.htm">Psalm 2</a>; <a href="../bible/isa009.htm#vrs6">Isaiah 9:6</a>, etc.) and openly claimed by <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in <a href="12404a.htm">Pilate's Court</a> (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs37">John 18:37</a>) belongs to Him not only in virtue of the <a href="07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a> but also by way of conquest and as a result of Redemption (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs32">Luke 1:32</a>). Whether or not the temporal dominion of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> belonged to His royal power, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that He understood His Kingdom to be of a higher order than the kingdoms of the world (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs36">John 18:36</a>). The spiritual kingship of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> is essentially characterized by its final object which is the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> welfare of men, its ways and means which are the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, its members who are only such as, through grace, have acquired the title of adopted children of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Supreme and universal, it is subordinate to no other and knows no limitations of either time or place. While the kingly functions of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> are not always performed visibly as in earthly kingdoms, it would be wrong to think of His Kingdom as a merely ideal system of thought. Whether viewed in this world or in the next, the <a href="08646a.htm">"Kingdom of God"</a> is essentially hierarchic, its first and last stage, that is, its constitution in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and its consummation in the final judgment, being official and visible acts of the King.</p>

<h3>Judge</h3>

<p>The Judicial office so emphatically asserted in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs31">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs64">26:64</a>; <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs22">John 5:22 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs42">Acts 10:42</a>) and early symbols [<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, nn. 1-41 (1-13)] belongs to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> in virtue of His Divinity and <a href="07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a> and also as a reward of Redemption. Seated at the right hand of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, in token not only of rest after the labours of His mortal life or of glory after the humiliations of His <a href="11527b.htm">Passion</a> or of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> after the ordeal of Golgotha, but also of <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> judicial power (<a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../fathers/1304.htm"><em>On Faith and the Creed</em></a>), He judges the living and the dead. His verdict inaugurated in each individual <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> will become final at the particular judgment and receive a solemn and definitive recognition at the assizes of the last judgment. (See <a href="02055a.htm">A<font size=-2>TONEMENT</font></a>.)</p>
