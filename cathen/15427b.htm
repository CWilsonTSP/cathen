<p>Reigned 537-55, <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died at <a href="14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>, 7 June 555. He belonged to a distinguished Roman <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>; his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> Johannes is called <em>consul</em> in the <em>Liber pontificalis</em> (ed. Duchesne, I, 298), having received that title from the emperor. Reparatus, a brother of Vigilius, was a senator (Procopius, <em>De bello gothico</em>, I, 26). Vigilius entered the service of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and was a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> in 531, in which year the Roman <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> agreed to a <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> empowering the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to determine the succession to the Papal See. Vigilius was chosen by <a href="02660a.htm">Boniface II</a> as his successor, and presented to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> assembled in <a href="13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. The opposition to such a procedure led <a href="02660a.htm">Boniface</a> in the following year to withdraw his designation of a successor and to burn the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> respecting it. The second successor of <a href="02660a.htm">Boniface</a>, Agapetus I (535-36), appointed Vigilius <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> representative (Apocrisiary) at Constantinople; Vigilius thus came to the Eastern capital. Empress Theodora sought to win him as a confederate, to revenge the deposition of the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Patriarch Anthimus of Constantinople by Agapetus and also to gain aid for her efforts in behalf of the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. Vigilius is said to have agreed to the plans of the intriguing empress who promised him the Papal See and a large sum of money (700 pounds of gold). After Agapetus's death on 22 April, 536, Vigilius returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> equipped with letters from the imperial Court and with money. Meanwhile Silverius had been made <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> through the influence of the King of the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a>. Soon after this the Byzantine commander Belisarius garrisoned the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which was, however, besieged again by the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a>. Vigilius gave Belisarius the letters from the Court of Constantinople, which recommended Vigilius himself for the Papal See. False accusations now led Belisarius to depose Silverius. Owing to the pressure exerted by the Byzantine commander, Vigilius was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in place of Silverius and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on 29 March, 537. Vigilius brought it about that the <a href="08010c.htm">unjustly</a> deposed Silverius was put into his keeping where the late <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> soon died from the harsh treatment he received. After the death of this predecessor Vigilius was recognized as <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by all the Roman <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Much in these accusations against Vigilius appears to be exaggerated, but the manner of his elevation to the <a href="07424b.htm">See of Rome</a> was not regular. Empress Theodora, however, saw that she had been deceived. For after the latter had attained the object of his <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> and been made <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> he maintained the same position as his predecessor against the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and the deposed Anthimus. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that there is an alleged letter from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to the deposed <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, Anthimus, Severus, and Theodosius, in which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> agrees with the views of the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. This letter, however, is not regarded as genuine by most investigators and bears all the marks of <a href="06135b.htm">forgery</a> (cf. Duchesne in <em>Revue des quest. histor.</em> (1884), II, 373; Chamard, ibid., I (1885), 557; Grisar in <em>Analecta romana</em>, I, 55 sqq.; Savio in <em>Civilta Catt.</em>, II (1910), 413-422]. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> did not restore Anthimus to his office.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It was not until the year 540 that Vigilius felt himself <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take a stand in regard to <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> which he did in two letters sent to Constantinople. One of the letters is addressed to Emperor Justinian, the other to the Patriarch Menas. In both letters the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> supports positively the Synods of Ephesus and Chalcedon, also the decisions of his predecessor <a href="09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, and throughout approves of the deposition of the Patriarch Anthimus. Several other letters written by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the first years of his pontificate, that have been preserved, give information respecting his interposition in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of various countries. On 6 March, 538, he wrote to Bishop <a href="03135b.htm">Caesarius of Arles</a> concerning the penance of the Austrasian King Theodobert on account of his marriage with his brother's <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a>. On 29 June, 538, a <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a> was sent to Bishop Profuturus of <a href="02728a.htm">Braga</a> containing decisions on various questions of church discipline. Bishop Auxanius and his successor, Aurelian of Arles, entered into communication with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> respecting the granting of the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> as a mark of the dignity and powers of a <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for Gaul; the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> sent suitable letters to the two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In the meantime new dogmatic difficulties had been developing at Constantinople that were to give the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> many hours of bitterness. In 543 Emperor Justinian issued a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> which condemned the various <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>; this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> was sent for signature both to the Oriental <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and to Vigilius (cf. <a href="11306b.htm">ORIGEN AND ORIGENISM</a>).</p>

<p>In order to draw Justinian's thoughts from <a href="11306b.htm">Origenism</a>, Theodore Askidas, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> in Cappadocia, called his attention to the fact that the condemnation of various representatives of the Antiochene <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, who had championed <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, would make union with the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> much easier. The emperor, who laid much stress upon winning over the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, agreed to this, and in 543 or 44 he issued a new edict condemning the <a href="14707b.htm"><em>Three Chapters</em></a> (see COUNCILS OF CONSTANTINOPLE). The Oriental <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed the condemnation of these <a href="14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. In Western <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, however, the procedure was considered unjustifiable and dangerous, because it was feared that it would detract from the importance of the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. Vigilius refused to acknowledge the imperial edict and was called to Constantinople by <a href="08578b.htm">Justinian</a>, in order to settle the matter there with a synod. According to the <em>Liber pontificalis</em> on 20 November, while the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was celebrating the feast of <a href="03471b.htm">St. Cecilia</a> in the Church of St. Cecilia in Trastevere, and before the service was fully ended, he was ordered by the imperial official Anthimus to start at once on the journey to Constantinople. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was taken immediately to a ship that waited in the Tiber, in order to be carried to the eastern capital, while a part of the populace cursed the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and threw stones at the ship. <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was now besieged by the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> under Totila and the inhabitants fell into the greatest misery. Vigilius sent ships with grain to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> but these were captured by the enemy. If the story related by the <em>Liber pontificalis</em> is essentially correct, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> probably left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 22 November, 545. He remained for a long time in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and reached Constantinople about the end of 546 or in January, 547.</p>

<p>Vigilius sought to persuade the emperor to send aid to the inhabitants of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> who were so hard pressed by the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a>. Justinian's chief interest, however, was in the matter of the <a href="14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, and as Vigilius was not ready to make concessions of this point and wavered frequently in his measures, he had much to suffer. The change in his position is to be explained by the fact that the condemnation of the writings mentioned was justifiable essentially, yet appeared inopportune and would lead to disastrous controversies with Western <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Finally, Vigilius acknowledged in a letter of 8 Dec., 553, to the <a href="05638b.htm">Patriarch Eutychius</a> the decisions of the Synod of Constantinople and declared his judgment in detail in a Constitution of 26 February, 554. Thus at the end of a sorrowful residence of eight years at Constantinople the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was able, after coming to an understanding with the emperor, to start on his return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the spring of 555. While on the journey he died at <a href="14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>. His body was brought to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and buried in the Basilica of Sylvester over the <a href="03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Priscilla on the Via Salaria.</p>
