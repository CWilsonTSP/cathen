<p>(B<font size=-2>URGENSIS</font>)</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of Burgos (from <em>burgi, burgorum</em>, signifying a consolidation of districts or small villages) has been since the tenth century an <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, to which in the eleventh century the ancient Sees of Oca and Valpuesta were transferred. In 1574 <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> raised it to <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank, at the request of Philip II. The archdiocese now (Concordat of 1851) comprises almost the entire province of Burgos. Its suffragans are: Calahorra (Logro&ntilde;o), El Burgo de Osma, <a href="11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, <a href="13458d.htm">Santander</a>, <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a>, and <a href="15489a.htm">Vitoria</a>. Its area is approximately 8694 square miles, with a population of 340,000. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 1220 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, which form forty-seven vicariates.</p>

<h2>Physical features</h2>

<p>The northern and eastern portion of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is mountainous, thickly wooded, and traversed by rivers, among which is the Ebro, which rises in the mountains and serves as the eastern boundary for Miranda. The Arlanza which crosses the diocese from east to west flows by Salas de los Infantes, near the famous <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Silos, and through the centre of the well-known town of Lerma. The mountainous region is unproductive of cereals, but fruits grow in abundance, and fine pasture-lands sustain great herds of cows and sheep, which furnish excellent meat and milk. Delicate cheeses which take their name from the city and are famous throughout <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, are made in this section. Minerals are abundant, especially sulphate of soda, common salt, iron, and hard coal. The southern part of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, especially the valley and plains, is fertile and produces abundantly vegetables, cereals, and quite a quantity of wind. The climate, cold but healthy, is damp towards the north. Although this section has few industries, the transportation of its fruit and minerals is greatly facilitated by the numerous highways and by the railroad between <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> which crosses the eastern side of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> from south to north. There are also some secondary railway lines for the operation of the mines.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Religious edifices</h2>

<p>Burgos possesses more religious monuments than any other Spanish diocese, not even excepting Toledo - evidences of the <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> of the counts and kings of <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a> and <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a>. In addition to the collegiate churches of Lerma, Villadiego, Plampiega, Palenzuela, Cobarrubias, and others, there are in Burgos alone many magnificent buildings. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which its <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Condestable, the <a href="07512b.htm">monastery of Las Huelgas</a>, and the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Miraflores, are museums of really permanent value.</p>

<h3>The cathedral</h3>

<p>As an <a href="05257a.htm">architectural</a> monument this structure displays the best features of the art of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. It was commenced by Bishop Mauritius in 1221, in the reign of Ferdinand III and Beatrice of Swabia, and is Gothic in style. The principal <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, Santa Mar&iacute;a la Mayor, faces west, and on either side rise two towers about 262 feet in height, terminating in octagonal spires covered with open stonework traceries. The <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is composed of three stories, or sections. The first, or ground story has three ogival entrances with rectangular openings; the second has a gallery enclosed by a pinnacled balustrade and a <a href="15653a.htm">rose window</a> as delicately carved as a piece of lace, which admits some light into the church. In the upper-most story there are two double-arched windows of ogival style, with eight intercolumnar spaces, in each of which there is a <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> on a pedestal. The whole is finished with a balustrade of letters carved in stone and forming the inscription: <em>Pulchra es et decora</em> (Thou art beautiful and graceful), in the centre of which is a <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. In the lateral sections (the towers) the windows are enclosed by stone balustrades, and the top is surmounted by balconies of stone surrounded by balustrades formed of Gothic letters in various inscriptions; needle-pointed pinnacles finish the four corners. The spires, as already said, are octagonal in shape; a gallery runs around the eight sides near the top, upon which rest the graceful points of the conical finial.</p>

<p>The north portal is known as the <em>portada de la Coroner&iacute;a</em>. In the lower portion of this are <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of the <a href="01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>, the windows in the central section being of the primitive ogival style, and in the upper story there are three double-arched windows with <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> joined to the shafts of the columns; two small spires, conical in shape like the main ones and decorated with balustrades, rise on either side of this <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. From the portal of the <em>Coroner&iacute;a</em> one can descend to that of the <em>Pellerjer&iacute;a</em>, which faces east and is of the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style known as the Plateresque. It is divided into three sections, the two end ones being alike, with the centre different in style and dimensions. The former are composed of pilasters minutely carved, between which four <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> are placed. The middle section, which serves for an entrance, has three alabaster pilasters, the intercolumnar spaces bearing panel-pictures representing the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. The <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> as a whole gives the impression of a gorgeous picture, and the ornate and fantastic devices sculptured all over its magnificent surface are simply innumerable.</p>

<p>The octagonal <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Condestable, of florid Gothic and very pure in design, is the best of the many <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Its roof if finished with balustraded turrets, needle-pointed pinnacles, <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a>, and countless other sculptural devices. In the lower portion coats of arms, shields, and crouching lions have been worked into the ensemble. The exterior of the <a href="13322b.htm">sacristy</a> is decorated with carved traceries, figures of <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> and armoured <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>. The tabernacle is of extraordinary magnificence and is composed of two octagonal sections in Corinthian style.</p>

<h3>Las Huelgas</h3>

<p>Next to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in magnificence is the famous <a href="07512b.htm">Monasterio de las Huelgas</a> on the outskirts of the city. It dates from the year 1180, and architecturally belongs to the transition period from Byzantine to Gothic, although in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> almost every style has been introduced into it. This <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> has two remarkable <a href="04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, one a very fine example of the earlier period and of the use of semi-circular arches and delicate and varied columns; the other of the ogival style of the transition period. The interior of the church is in the style of the latter, enormous columns supporting its magnificent vault; the entrance is modern. This <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> is celebrated for the extraordinary privileges granted to its <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> by kings and <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3>Miraflores</h3>

<p>The <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Miraflores, celebrated for the strict observance of its rule, is situated about one mile from the city. A very beautiful and life-like <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> carved in wood is one of the treasures of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>; the stalls in the church also display exquisite workmanship. The mausoleum of King John II and of his wife Isabel, in this <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, is constructed of the finest marble and so delicately carved that portions seem to be sculptured in wax rather than stone. Around the top are beautiful <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> in miniature, which might be the work of Phidias. The French soldiers in the War of Independence (1814) mutilated this beautiful work, cutting off some of the heads and carrying them away to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<h3>Celebrated churches</h3>

<p>Burgos has other important churches. That of Santa Agueda, commonly called Santa Gadea, is chiefly celebrated for its antiquity and for the historic fact that it was in this church that Alfonso VI, in the presence of the famous <a href="03769a.htm">Cid Campeador</a> (Rodrigo D&iacute;az del Vivar), <a href="11176a.htm">swore</a> that he had taken no part in the death of his brother the king, Don Sancho, assassinated in the Cerco de Zamora. Without this <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> he never would have been allowed to succeed to the royal crown of <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a>. In this church also the Augustinian friar, St. Juan de Sahag&uacute;n, was wont to preach, hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and give missions, after he had renounced the <a href="03252a.htm">canonry</a> and other <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> which he held in that <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Among the other notable churches are: San Esteban, San Gil (Sancti Aegidii), San Pedro, San Cosme y San Damian, Santiago (Sancti Jacobi), San Lorenzo, and San Lesmes (Adelelmi). The Convento de la Merced, occupied by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and the Hospital del Rey are also worthy of mention. In the walls of the city are the famous gateway of Santa Mar&iacute;a, erected for the first entrance of the <a href="03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, and the arch of Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> has two fine <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>. There are also many institutions for secular <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. Schools are maintained in every <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the Instituto Provincial, and many colleges are conducted by private <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>, <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> both <a href="04060a.htm">cloistered</a> and uncloistered.</p>

<h3>History of Burgos</h3>

<p>When the Romans took possession of what is now the province of Burgos it was inhabited by the Morgobos, Turmodigos, Berones, and perhaps also the Pelendones, the last inhabitants of the northern part of the Celtiberian province. The principal cities, according to Ptolemy, were: Brabum, Sisara, Deobrigula, Ambisna Segiasamon, Verovesca (Briviesca), and others. In the time of the Romans it belonged to Hither <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Hispania Citerior) and afterwards to the <a href="14459a.htm">Tarragonese</a> province. The <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> occupied all of <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a>, though only for a brief period, and left no trace of their occupation. Alfonso (III) the Great reconquered it about the middle of the ninth century, and built many castles for the defence of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, then extending their dominion and reconquering the lost territory. In this way the region came to be known as Castilla (<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>castella</em>), i.e. "land of castles". Don Diego, Count of Porcelos, was entrusted with the government of this territory, and commanded to promote the increase of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> population; with this end in view he gathered the inhabitants of the surrounding country into one village, which took the name of Burgos, or burgi. The city thus bounded began to be called Caput Castellae. The territory (<em>condado</em>), subject to the Kings of <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a>, continued to be governed by counts and was gradually extended by victories over the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a>, until the time of Fern&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez, the greatest of these rulers, when it became independent; it later on took the name of the Kingdom of Castile, being sometimes united with Navarre and sometimes with Leon. In the reign of <a href="06042a.htm">St. Ferdinand III</a> (c. 1200-52), <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a> and Castile were definitely united, but they continued to be called respectively the Kingdom of <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a> and the Kingdom of Castile until the nineteenth century. This district has been the scene of many and varied events: the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> with the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, the struggles between Leon and Navarre, and between <a href="03410b.htm">Castile and Aragon</a>, the War of Independence against <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and the civil <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of the Spanish succession.</p>

<h2>Councils</h2>

<p>Some important councils have been held in Burgos. A national council took place there in 1078, although opinions differ as to date (the "Bolet&iacute;n de la Academia de la Historiade Madrid", 1906, XLIX, 337, says 1080). This was presided over by the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate, Cardinal Roberto and attended by Alfonso VI, and was convoked for the purpose of introducing into <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> the <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> and <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> instead of the Gothic, or Mozarabic, then in use. Another national council, presided over by Cardinal Boso (d. 1181), also <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate, settled questions of discipline and established <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and limits. The proceedings of this council remained unpublished until quite recently, when they were made known in the Bolet&iacute;n already mentioned (XLVIII) 395). In 1898 a provincial council was called by <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> (not <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Don Fr. Gregorio Aguirre, in which the <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> were most minutely set forth.</p>

<p>St. Julian, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cuenca, called the Almoner, because of his great charity to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, was born in Burgos; also St. Amaro the Pilgrim, who has always had a special cult paid to him in Burgos, though not found in the Roman Martyrology. St. I&ntilde;igo (Enecus or Ignatius), <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of O&ntilde;a, while not born in Burgos, laboured there for many years; also St. Domingo de Silos, <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> and reformer of the famous <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Silos, and St. Juan de Sahag&uacute;n, a native of that town in the province of <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a>. Among its <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> may also be mentioned the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Carde&ntilde;a, a religious of the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the same name, who in the tenth century were <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> for the Faith by the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> soldiers of the Emir of <a href="04359b.htm">Cordova</a> in one of their numerous invasions of <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a>; and St. Casilda, daughter of one of the <a href="10424a.htm">Moorish</a> kings of Toledo. She was converted near Burgos whither she had gone with her father's consent to drink the water of some medicinal springs. She built a hermitage and died a saintly death.</p>

<h2>Famous bishops and citizens</h2>

<p>In the long line of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> the following deserve special mention: Pablo de Santa Mar&iacute;a (1396-1456), a converted rabbi, preceptor and counsellor of John II; his son and successor (1435-56) Alfonso (de Cartagena), one of the most learned members of the Council of Basle and to whom is owing the erection of the Chapel del Condestable by Juan de Colonia, a German architect who accompanied him to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>; Cardinal Inigo L&oacute;pez de Mendoza y Zuniga, brother of the Count of Pe&ntilde;aranda, Duke of Miranda, who in 1535 convoked a synod; the Cardinal Archbishop de Pacheco, in whose time Burgos was raised to the dignity of an <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>; and Archbishop Don Fr. Gregorio Aguirre, also administrator of the See of Calahorra.</p>

<p>Among the famous <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>, the name of Rodrigo D&iacute;az del Vivar (d. 1099), the <a href="03769a.htm">Cid Campeador</a>, naturally stands pre-eminent. He was the hero of his time, and the man most feared by the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>, whom he defeated in innumerable encounters. He is buried in Burgos, in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Pedro de Carde&ntilde;a. Don Ram&oacute;n Bonifaz was according to some authorities a native of Burgos, but in any event he lived there. St. Ferdinand entrusted to him the task of forming the Spanish squadron with which he established and maintained communication with the troops who were besieging Seville, and prevented the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> from communicating with the city. One of his fleets destroyed the bridge by which the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> had access to the outside world and received provisions; this brought about the surrender (1248) of the city of Seville to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, led by St. Ferdinand himself.</p>
