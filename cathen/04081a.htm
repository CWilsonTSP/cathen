<p>The most celebrated <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the <a href="15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> Bible, remarkable as the best witness to the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> text of <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and as a fine specimen of <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> calligraphy, now kept at Florence in the Bibliotheca Laurentiana. The symbol for it is written <em>am</em> or A (Wordsworth). It is preserved in an immense tome, measuring in height and breadth 19 1/4 inches by 13 3/8 inches, and in thickness 7 inches &#151; so impressive, as Hort says, as to fill the beholder with a feeling akin to awe. Some consider it, with White, as perhaps "the finest book in the world"; still there are several <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which are as beautifully written and have besides, like the Book of Kells or Book of <a href="09269a.htm">Lindisfarne</a>, those exquisite ornaments of which Amiatinus is devoid. It contains 1029 leaves of strong, smooth vellum, fresh-looking today, despite their great antiquity, arranged in quires of four sheets, or quaternions. It is written in uncial characters, large, clear, regular, and beautiful, two columns to a page, and 43 or 44 lines to a column. A little space is often left between words, but the writing is in general continuous. The text is divided into sections, which in the Gospels correspond closely to the Ammonian Sections. There are no marks of punctuation, but the skilled reader was guided into the sense by stichometric, or verse-like, arrangement into coda and commata, which correspond roughly to the principal and dependent clauses of a sentence. This manner of writing the scribe is believed to have modelled upon the great Bible of <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, but it goes back perhaps even to <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>; it may be shown best by an example:</p>

<blockquote><p><br>QUIA IN POTESTATE ERAT <br>SERMO IPSIUS <br>ET IN SYNAGOGA ERAT HOMO HABENS <br>DAEMONIUM INMUNDUM <br>ET EXCLAMAVIT VOCE MAGNA <br>DICENS <br>SINE QUID NOBIS ET TIBI IHU <br>NAZARENE VENISTI PERDERE NOS <br>SCIO TE QUI SIS SCS DI <br>ET INCREPAVIT ILLI IHS DICENS </p></blockquote>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It will be noticed that the section "ET IN" and the coda begin at about the same perpendicular line, the commata begin further in under the third or second letter, and so likewise does the continuation of a colon or comma which runs beyond a single line (see facsimile page). This arrangement, besides aiding the intelligence of the text, gave a spacious, varied, and rather artistic appearance to the page. The initial letter of a section was often written in ink of a different colour, and so also was the first line of a book. Beyond that there was no attempt at decorating the text.</p>

<p>The codex (or pandect) is usually said to contain the whole Bible; but it should be noted that the Book of Baruch is missing, though the Epistle of Jeremias, usually incorporated with it, is here appended to the Book of Jeremias. Besides the text of the Scriptural books, it contains <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> "Prologus Galeatus" and his prefaces to individual books; the <em>capitula</em>, or summaries of contents; and, in the first quaternion, certain materials which have been much discussed and have <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> of the greatest service in tracing the history of the codex, among them dedicatory verses, a list of the books contained in the codex, a picture of the Tabernacle (formerly thought to be Solomon's Temple), a division of the Biblical books according to <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, another according to Hilary and Epiphanius, and a third according to <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>. Part of Solomon's <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#vrs22">1 Kings 8:22-30</a>) in an Old Latin text is reproduced at the end of Ecclesiasticus. A Greek inscription at the beginning of Leviticus, recording that "the Lord Servandus prepared" this codex or part of it, has entered largely into the discussion of its origin.</p>

<p>The recovery of the history of Codex Amiatinus, which has important bearings upon the history of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> itself and of the text of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, was due to the labours of many scholars and the insight of one man of genius, de Rossi. At the beginning of the pandect, as we have mentioned, there are certain dedicatory verses; they record the gift (of the codex) to the venerable <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Saviour by a certain Peter who was <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> from the extreme territory of the Lombards. The Latin text is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><br><em>CENOBIUM</em> AD EXIMII MERITO <br>VENERABILE <em>SALVATORIS</em> <br>QUEM CAPUT ECCLESIAE <br>DEDICAT ALTA FIDES <br><em>PETRUS LANGOBARDORUM</em> <br>EXTREMIS DE FINIB. ABBAS <br>DEVOTI AFFECTUS <br>PIGNORA MITTO MEI </p></blockquote>

<p>St. Saviour's is the name of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> on Monte Amiata (whence <em>Amiatinus</em>) near <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>; here this codex was kept from the ninth century till the year 1786, when it was brought to Florence after the suppression of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Naturally, the codex was supposed to be a gift to this house, but nothing was known of the donor. Bandini, the librarian of the Laurentiana, into whose hands the codex came, noticed that the names of neither the donor nor the recipient belonged to the original dedication. They were written in a different hand over parts of the original inscription, as betrayed by evident signs of erasure. The letters italicized above were by the second hand, while the initial letter C of the first line and the E in the fifth were original. Bandini noticed, also, that <em>cenobium</em> replaced a shorter word and that the last five letters of <em>salvatoris</em> were written on parchment that had not been erased, and so that the ten letters of this word replaced five of the original word. The metre also was entirely at fault. The clue for reconstructing the original lines he found in the expression <em>caput ecclesi&aelig;</em>, which he judged referred to St. Peter. And as in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a favourite title for the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> was <em>culmen apostolicum</em>, he reconstructed the line in this fashion:</p>

<blockquote><p>CULMEN AD EXIMII MERITO VENERABILE PETRI </p></blockquote>

<p>This conjecture produced a correct hexameter verse, retained the original initial C, supplied a word of proper length at the beginning and another at the end, and afforded a sense fitting in perfectly with the probabilities of the case. In the fifth line, instead of <em>Petrus Langobardorum</em>, Bandini suggested <em>Servandus Latii</em>, because of the inscription about Servandus mentioned above. This Servandus was believed to be a friend of St. Benedict, to whom he made a visit at <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> in 541; he was <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> near the extremity of Latium.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>These conjectures were accepted by the learned world; Tischendorf, for instance, writing seventy-five years later, said Bandini had so well <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> his case that no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> remained. Accordingly, it was settled that the Codex Amiatinus dated from the middle of the sixth century, was the oldest <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, and was written in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. A few protests were raised, however; that, for instance, of Paul de Lagarde. He had edited <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> translation of the Hebrew <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, using freely for that purpose a codex of the ninth century; Amiatinus he judged, with a not unnatural partiality, to be "in all probability" from the hand of the scribe of his ninth-century <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, written "at <a href="12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> on the Lake of Constance". But, to quote Corssen, it was G. B. de Rossi, "that great Roman scholar, whose never-failing perspicacity and learning discovered at once the birthplace of our famous <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>" (Academy, 7 April, 1888).</p>

<p>De Rossi followed Bandini in his reconstruction of the first verse, but he thought it unlikely that an <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, presenting a book to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, should speak of "the extreme limits of Latium", really but a short distance from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Anzizni, the librarian of the Laurentiana, pointed out to him that the space erased to make room for <em>Petrus Langobardorum</em> was greater than called for by the conjecture of Bandini. <a href="04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> was at the time engaged on an inquiry into the ancient history of the Vatican <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>, and, recalling a passage of <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a>, he divined that the lost name was <em>Ceolfridus</em>. The erasures, which were irregular, seeming to follow the letters very closely, corresponded perfectly to this conjecture. He proposed then the verse:</p>

<blockquote><p>CEOLFRIDUS BRITONUM EXTREMIS DE FINIB. ABBAS </p></blockquote>

<p>The phrase exactly suited an <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> from the end of the world, as <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> was then regarded and styled; and the story of Ceolfrid made de Rossi's conjectures acceptable at once, especially to English scholars. Ceolfrid was the disciple of Benedict Biscop, who founded the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a> and Jarrow in Northumberland towards the end of the seventh century. <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, in those days, was the most devoted daughter of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman See</a>, and Abbot Benedict was enthusiastic in his devotion. His <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were dependent directly on <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Five times during his life he journeyed to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, usually bring back with him a <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of books presented by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Ceolfrid, who had accompanied him on one of these visits, became his successor in 686 and inherited his taste for books; <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a> mentions three pandects of <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> translation which he had made, one of which he determined in his old age, in 716, to bring to the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He died on the way, but his gift was carried to the Holy Father, then <a href="06787a.htm">Gregory II</a>. This codex de Rossi identified with Amiatinus.</p>

<p>This conjecture was hailed by all as a genuine discovery of great importance. Berger, however, objected to <em>Britonum</em>, suggesting <em>Anglorum.</em> Hort soon placed the matter beyond the possibility of <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>. In an anonymous life of Ceolfrid, the chief source of <a href="02384a.htm">Bede's</a> information, which, though twice published, had been overlooked by all, Hort found the story of Ceolfrid journeying to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and carrying the pandect inscribed with the verses:</p>

<blockquote><p><br>CORPUS AD EXIMII MERITO VENERABILE PETRI <br>DEDICAT ECCLESIAE QUEM CAPUT ALTA FIDES <br>CEOLFRIDUS, ANGLORUM EXTIMIS DE FINIBUS ABBAS </p></blockquote>

<p>etc. Despite the variations, there could be no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> of their identity with the dedicatory verses of Amiatinus; <em>Corpus</em> was of course the original, not <em>Culmen</em>, and <em>Anglorum</em>, not <em>Britonum</em>; the other differences were perhaps due to a lapse of memory, or this version may represent the original draft of the dedication. <a href="04739c.htm">De Rossi's</a> chief point was <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> right. It established that Amiatinus originated in Northumberland about the beginning of the eighth century, having been made, as <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a> states, at Ceolfrid's order. It does not follow, however, that the scribe was an Englishman; the writing and certain peculiarities of orthography have led some to believe him an Italian. We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that these two <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> had brought over a Roman musician to train the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in the Roman chant, and they may also, for a similar purpose, have procured from <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> a skilled calligrapher. The handwriting of Amiatinus bears a strong resemblance to some fragments of St. Luke in a Durham <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, to <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> fragments bound up with the Utrecht <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, and to the Stonyhurst St. John; these facts, together with <a href="02384a.htm">Bede's</a> statement that Ceolfrid had three pandects written, indicate that "there was a large and flourishing <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of calligraphy at <a href="15572a.htm">Wearmouth</a> or Jarrow in the seventh and eighth centuries, of which till lately we had no <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at all" (White). This conclusion is confirmed by peculiarities in the text and in certain of the summaries.</p>

<p>The contents of the first quaternion of Amiatinus coincide so remarkably with descriptions of the celebrated Codex Grandior of <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> that it has been supposed that the leaves were transferred from it bodily; the conjecture has been rendered more credible by the fact that this codex was actually seen in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a>, perhaps before Amiatinus was carried to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Moreover, the contents of our codex do not correspond exactly to the list prefixed which purports to give the contents. These reasons, however, would only prove that the Codex Grandior served as the model, which seems indubitable; while, on the other hand, weighty reasons have been urged against the other attractive hypothesis (see White and de Rossi).</p>

<p>Despite the lowering of its date by a century and a half, Amiatinus holds the first place for purity of text among the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. Its excellence is best explained on the ground that its prototype was an ancient <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, perhaps one of those brought from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Benedict Biscop, perhaps one brought by Adrian, <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, when in 668 he accompanied Benedict and Theodore to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. It is remarkable that Amiatinus and the other Northumbrian <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a> are nearest in text to <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, especially to Southern Italian, and to <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> betraying Italian descent. The group to which it belongs bears the closest relationship to the best-esteemed Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> extant, <em>aleph</em>, B. (Cf. <a href="09627a.htm">MANUSCRIPTS OF THE BIBLE</a>; BIBLICAL CRITICISM, sub-title <em>Textual</em>.) In the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the text is not of equal purity throughout; Berger, e.g., notes the inferiority of Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus, and Tischendorf of Machabees. The <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> does not present the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text, but <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> translation from the Hebrew (cf. PSALTER; <a href="15515b.htm">VULGATE</a>). The excellence of the Amiatine text is not a new discovery: it was well known to the Sixtine revisers of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, who used it constantly and preferred it, as a rule, to any other. To this is largely due the comparative purity of the official <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text and its freedom from so many of the corruptions found in the received Greek text, which rests, as is well known, on some of the latest and most imperfect Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.</p>
