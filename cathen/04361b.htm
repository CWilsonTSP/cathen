<p>Vicariate apostolic, coextensive with the Empire of Corea; it was created a distinct <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>, 9 September, 1831. But for nearly half a century before that time Corea had many fervent <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In a manner perhaps unique in the annals of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Faith was introduced there without preaching and before any missionaries had penetrated the country. The <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> people, more eager for new <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the more their country was jealously closed, procured through the annual embassy to Peking all the books possible upon <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, literature, etc. Some <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> books fell into their hands, and, the <a href="06689a.htm">grace of God</a> aiding, they recognized the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. One of them, Ni-seung-houn, undertook in 1784 the journey to Peking and was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> there, under the name of Peter. Upon his return he <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> his companions, who, like himself, were men of learning and high position. That their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> was firm, events <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>. In 1791 Paul Youn and Jacques Kouen sealed their <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> with their blood for having refused to offer sacrifice upon the occasion of the death of their relatives. Connected by reason of its origin with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Peking, Corea was dependent upon that vicariate until 1831. About the year 1794, a <a href="03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, Father Jacques Tjyou, was sent to Corea. Upon his arrival he found about 4000 faithful. After seven years of a heroic and fruitful ministry he was arrested and <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a>, 31 May, 1801. Before and after him numerous <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with admirable <a href="06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Among them particular mention is due to the married couple, Jean Ryou and Luthgarde Ni. Shaken and decimated by the tempest, and deprived of its <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> was preserved by the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the fervent people, <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> catechists, who rallied the dispersed, and made unheard-of efforts to obtain <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> from the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Peking or the <a href="12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. It was at this time that the <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> was established, and confided to the <a href="14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The first <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> named, Mgr. Brugui&egrave;re, came from the mission of <a href="13765a.htm">Siam</a>. He started upon his journey in 1832, suffered incredible hardships in passing through <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, and died in Tatary, just as he was completing arrangements to enter the country of his mission. His companion, Father Maubant, succeeded in crossing the northern frontier by way of Eui-tjyou, and in January, 1836, entered the closed country. The following year Father Chasten joined him there, and, a little later, the new <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Mgr. Imbert. Under their ministration <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> soon flourished. All this went on with the greatest secrecy; the least indiscretion would have caused all to be lost. The edicts proscribing <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> remained as rigorous as ever, and all, both <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> and flock, lived as upon the eve of battle, preparing themselves for <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out in 1839, many <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were arrested, tortured, and <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a>; the missionaries were hunted without mercy. Mgr. Imbert was the first to be taken, and, thinking that the capture of his two companions would cause the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> to cease, he directed them to deliver themselves up; they responded heroically to the call, and all three were beheaded, 21 September, 1839. It was not until 1845 that a new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr. Ferr&eacute;ol, succeeded in entering Corea; he brought with him a young missionary and also the first Corean <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, Andr&eacute; Kim, who had made his studies at <a href="09481b.htm">Macao</a>, and who was taken and executed the following year. His cause, and those of the Venerable Mgrs. Imbert, Maubant, and Chastan, and of the principal Corean <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, eighty-two in all, were introduced in the Roman Court by a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of 24 September, 1857. The country remained more firmly closed than ever, the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> more severely proscribed, and the entrance of apostolic workers more perilous and difficult. Admission to Corea was most often accomplished by way of the sea, a Chinese barque bringing the missionaries with great secrecy to the coast of Corea, where a Corean ship, under cover of the darkness, would go to meet them. <a href="09554a.htm">Father Maistre</a> spent ten years in vain attempts and useless expeditions before he was able to set foot in Corea. Notwithstanding these difficulties, and numerous local persecutions, during twenty years the mission prospered. In 1866 it counted upwards of 25,000 <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and ten missionaries. A terrible <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> then broke out, the two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and seven missionaries were taken and executed: Mgr. Berneux, <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, with Fathers Beaulieu, Dorie, and de Breteni&egrave;res (8 March); Father Pourthi&eacute;, pro-vicar, and Father Petitnicolas (10 March); and Mgr. Daveluy, the coadjutor, with Fathers Auma&icirc;tre and Huin (30 March). Numbers of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> also suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, while other perished of distress and hunger in the mountains. The process, or formal declaration, of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of the seven missionaries, and of twenty of the principal <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, was sent in 1901 to the Sacred Congregation of Rites. The three surviving missionaries, unable to maintain themselves in the country, were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>. This <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, which occurred during the second year of the reign of the emperor who abdicated in 1907, was not precisely his fault. During his minority the power was exercised by his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, known under the name of Tai-ouen-koun, prince-regent. Of a suspicious and violent character, the regent believed that the extermination of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Corea was the best policy to follow. Later he recognized his mistake and repented of it.</p>

<p>A French attempt, known as the Kang-hoa expedition, made to avenge the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> of the French missionaries, was not prosecuted with sufficient vigour, and merely served to revive the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> which lasted as long as the regent remained in power. In 1876, after an interval of ten years, the new <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Mgr. Ridel, succeeded in sending two missionaries to Corea; he himself entered the following year with two others. But after some months of sojourn in Seoul his retreat became known and he was thrown into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>. Upon the demand of the French minister to Peking, the Corean Government consented to send him back to <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>; in 1879, Father Deguette, arrested in turn, was also sent back after several months of captivity. The bloody era was closed; nevertheless the missionaries were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to continue their life of seclusion. Liberty came to them only with the treaty of commerce, concluded with the different Powers towards the year 1884. Upon their return in 1876 they found but 10,000 <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>; since then this number has grown from year to year. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Coreans numbered in 1885, 14,039; 1890, 17,577; 1895, 25,998; 1900, 42,441; 1905, 58,593; and in 1907, 63,340. From 1876 dates the spread of the ordinary mission-labours which the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> had not permitted to develop.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1888 the <a href="11587c.htm">Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres</a> were called to take charge of the <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. In each district some <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> have been built, with residences for the missionaries. In 1892 a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> was built at Ryong-saun near Seoul. The quasi-cathedral chur<a href="03041a.htm">ch</a> of Seoul was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 29 May, 1898. The <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> have been opened anew, or organized upon a better footing. It has even been possible to open in the great centres a few <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, a thing which Corean usage would never before have permitted. In 1875 the missionaries published a dictionary and a grammar in French and Corean. The movable type then cast has served as a standard for all that is used today. The mission possesses a printing-house for the publication of Corean <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books, and of a weekly Corean <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper, founded in 1906, which counts more than 4000 subscribers. As a striking event of this period may be noted the conversion to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of the princess, the mother of the emperor and the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> wife of the terrible regent. <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> in her heart even before the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 1866, she was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> and confirmed 11 October, 1896, but in great secrecy and unknown even to those about her. The following year she received, under the same conditions, the Sacraments of Penance and of <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and died piously 8 January, 1898. The Vicars Apostolic of Corea have been: Barth&eacute;l&eacute;my Brugui&egrave;re (1831-35); Laurent-Marie-Joseph Imbert (1837-39); Jean-Joseph Ferr&eacute;ol (1843-53); Sim&eacute;on-Fran&ccedil;ois Berneux (1854-66); Marie-Antoine Nicolas Daveluy (1857-66); F&eacute;lix Clair Ridel (1870-84); Jean-Marie-Gustave Blanc (1884-90); Gustave-Charles-Marie Mutel (1890-).</p>

<p>The following statistics show the state of the missions in 1907: 1 <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; 46 French missionaries; 10 Corean priests; 11 French sisters; 41 Corean sisters; 72 <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, with 1,014 pupils; 6 <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, with 191 pupils; 2 <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, with 28 boys and 261 girls; 379 <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a> placed in <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>; 2 pharmacies; 1 <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, with 22 preparatory students and 9 <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students; 48 churches or <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 48 districts; 931 <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 63,340 <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>; 5,503 <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> under instruction.</p>
