<p>(Enea Silvio de' Piccolomini).</p>

<p>Born at Corsignano, near <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>, 18 Oct., 1405; elected 19 Aug., 1458; died at <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, 14 Aug., 1464. He was the eldest of eighteen children of Silvio de' Piccolomini and Vittoria Forteguerra. Although of noble birth, straitened circumstances forced him to help his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> in the cultivation of the estate which the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> owned at Corsignano. This village he later ranked as a town and made an episcopal residence with the name of Pienza (Pius). Having received some elementary instruction from a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, he entered, at the age of eighteen, the <a href="13781a.htm">University of Siena</a>. Here he gave himself up to diligent study and the free enjoyment of sensual pleasures. In 1425 the preaching of <a href="02505b.htm">St. Bernardine of Siena</a> kindled in him the desire of embracing a monastic life, but he was dissuaded from his purpose by his friends. Attracted by the fame of the celebrated Filelfo, he shortly after spent two years in the study of the classics and poetry at Florence. He returned to <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> at the urgent request of his relatives, to devoted his time to the study of <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. Passing through <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> on his way to the Council of Basle, Capranica, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06043c.htm">Fermo</a>, invited Enea to accompany him as his secretary. Bishop and secretary arrived there in 1432, and joined the opposition to <a href="05601a.htm">Pope Eugene IV</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Piccolomini, however, soon left the service of the impecunious Capranica for more remunerative employment with Nicodemo della Scala, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Freising, with Bartolomeo, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11134b.htm">Novara</a>, and with <a href="01258b.htm">Cardinal Albergati</a>. He accompanied the latter on several journeys, particularly to the Congress of <a href="01752c.htm">Arras</a>, which in 1435 discussed peace between <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. In the same year his master sent him on a secret mission to <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The voyage was very tempestuous and Piccolomini vowed to walk, if spared, barefoot from the port of arrival to the nearest shrine of <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. He landed at Dunbar and, from the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of ten miles through ice and snow to the sanctuary of Whitekirk, he contracted the gout from which he suffered for the rest of his life. Although on his return from <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a> <a href="01258b.htm">Cardinal Albergati</a> was no longer at Basle, he determined to remain in the city, and to his <a href="07538b.htm">humanistic</a> culture and oratorical talent owed his appointment to different important functions by the council. He continued to side with the opposition to <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, and associated particularly with a small circle of friends who worshipped classical antiquity and led dissolute lives. That he freely indulged his passions is evidenced not only by the birth of two <a href="07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> children to him (the one in <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, the other at <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>), but by the frivolous manner in which he glories in his own disorders. The low moral standard of the epoch may partly explain, but cannot excuse his dissolute conduct. He had not yet received <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, however, and shrank from the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> because of the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of continence which it imposed. Even the inducement to become one of the electors of a successor to <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, unlawfully deposed, could not overcome this reluctance; rather than receive the <a href="04647c.htm">diaconate</a> he refused the proffered <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<p>He was then appointed master of ceremonies to the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> which elected Amadeus of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. He likewise belonged to the delegation which was to escort to Basle in 1439 the newly- elected <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, who assumed the name of <a href="06031b.htm">Felix V</a> and chose Piccolomini as his secretary. The latter's clearsightedness, however, soon enabled him to realize that the position of the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> party could not fail to become untenable, and he profited by his presence as envoy of the council at the Diet of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> in 1442 again to change masters. His literary attainments were brought to the attention of Frederick III, who <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> him imperial poet, and offered him a position in his service which was gladly accepted. On 11 Nov., 1442, Enea left Basle for <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he assumed in January of the following year the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of secretary in the imperial chancery. Receding gradually from his attitude of supporter of <a href="06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, he ultimately became, with the imperial chancellor Schlick, whose favour he enjoyed, a partisan of <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>. The formal reconciliation between him and this <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> took place in 1445, when he came on an official mission to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was first absolved of the censures which he had incurred as partisan of the Council of Basle and official of the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>. Hand in hand with this change in personal allegiance went a transformation in his moral character and in March, 1446, he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. The same year he succeeded in breaking up the Electors' League, equally dangerous to <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> and Frederick III, and shortly afterwards a delegation, of which he was a member, laid before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the conditional submission of almost all <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1447 he was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Trieste; the following year he played a prominent part in the conclusion of the Concordat of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; and in 1450 he received the Bishopric of <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>. He continued, however, until 1455 in the service of Frederick III, who had frequent recourse to his diplomatic ability. In 1451 he appeared in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> at the head of a royal embassy, and in 1452 accompanied Frederick to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the imperial <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>. He was created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> 18 Dec., 1456, by <a href="03187a.htm">Calixtus III</a>, whose successor he became.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The central <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of his pontificate was the liberation of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> from <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> domination. To this end he summoned at the beginning of his reign all the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes to meet in congress on 1 June, 1459. Shortly before his departure for Mantua, where he was personally to direct the deliberations of this assembly, he issued a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> instituting a new <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order of <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>. They were to bear the name of Our Lady of Bethlehem and to have their headquarters in the Island of Lemnos. History is silent concerning the actual existence of this foundation, and the order was probably never organized. At Mantua scant attendance necessitated a delay in the opening of the sessions until 26 Sept., 1459. Even then but few delegates were present, and the deliberations soon revealed the fact that the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> states could not be relied on for mutual co-operation against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> pursued dilatory and insincere tactics; <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> would promise nothing, because the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had preferred Ferrante of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> for the throne of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> to the pretender of the House of Anjou. Among the German delegates, <a href="07010a.htm">Gregory of Heimburg</a> assumed an ostentatiously disrespectful attitude toward Pius II; the country, however, ultimately agreed to raise 32,000 footmen and 10,000 cavalry. But the promise was never redeemed, and although a three years' <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> was decreed against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the congress failed of its object, as no practical results of any importance were attained. It was apparent that the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> no longer commanded the assent and respect of any of the Powers. This was further demonstrated by the fact that Pius, on the eve of his departure from <a href="09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, issued the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Execrabilis", in which he condemned all appeals from the decisions of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to an oecumenical council (18 Jan., 1460).</p>

<p>During the congress <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> had broken out in southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> about the possession of the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> continued to support Ferrante against the Angevin claimant. This attitude was adverse to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interests in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, where he aimed at the repeal of the <a href="12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. At his accession to the throne in 1461, Louis XI suppressed indeed that instrument; but this <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> success was more apparent than real. For Louis's expectation of support in southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was not realized; and opposition to the suppression manifesting itself in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, his dealings with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> underwent a corresponding change, and royal ordinances were even issued aiming at the revival of the former Gallican liberties. In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> Frederick III showed readiness to comply with the <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> assumed at <a href="09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, but foreign and domestic difficulties rendered him powerless. Between Pius II and Duke Sigismund of Tyrol, however, an acute conflict developed concerning the Bishopric of <a href="02793d.htm">Brixen</a>. Likewise the refusal of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="04789a.htm">Diether of Isenburg</a> to abide by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of deposition led to civil strife. Diether was ultimately defeated and supplanted by Adolf of Nassau, who had been appointed in his stead. More difficult to adjust were the troubles in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. Hussitism was rampant in the kingdom, which was governed by the wily George Podiebrad, a king seemingly devoid of religious convictions. He had promised in a secret <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> personally to profess the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and to restore, in his realm, union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in ritual and worship. This was tantamount to a renunciation of the "Compact of Basle", which, under certain conditions subsequently not observed by the <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, had granted them communion under both kinds and other privileges. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, deceived for a time by the protestations of royal fidelity, used his influence to bring back the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> city of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> to the king's allegiance. But in 1461 Podiebrad, to further his fanciful schemes of political aggrandizement, promised his subjects to maintain the Compact. When in 1462 his long- promised embassy appeared in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, its purpose was not only to do homage to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, but also to obtain the confirmation of that agreement. Pius II, instead of acceding to the latter request, withdrew the misused concessions made by Basle. He continued negotiations with the king, but died before any settlement was reached.</p>

<p>The prevalence of such discord in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> left but little hope for armed opposition to the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. As rumours had been circulated that the sultan <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> attempted to convert him to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>. But in vain did he address to him in 1461 a letter, in which were set forth the claims of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> on his <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>. Possibly the transfer with extraordinary pomp of the <a href="12734a.htm">head</a> of <a href="01471a.htm">St. Andrew</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was also a fruitless attempt to rekindle <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. As a last resort, Pius II endeavoured to stir up the enthusiasm of the apathetic <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes by placing himself at the head of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. Although seriously ill he left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the East, but died at <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, the mustering-place of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> troops.</p>

<p>There have been widely divergent appreciations of the life of Pius II. While his varied talents and superior culture cannot be <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a>, the motives of his frequent transfer of allegiance, the causes of the radical transformations which his opinions underwent, the influences exercised over him by the environment in which his lot was cast, are so many factors, the bearing of which can be justly and precisely estimated only with the greatest difficulty. In the early period of his life he was, like many <a href="07538b.htm">humanists</a>, frivolous and immoral in conduct and writing. More earnest were his conceptions and manner of life after his entrance into the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. As <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> he was indeed not sufficiently free from nepotism, but otherwise served the best interests of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Not only was he constantly solicitous for the peace of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> against <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a>, but he also instituted a commission for the reform of the Roman court, seriously endeavoured to restore monastic discipline, and defended the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> against the writings of Reginald Peacock, the former <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03657a.htm">Chichester</a>. He retracted the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> contained in his earlier writings in a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the gist of which was "Reject Eneas, hold fast to Pius". <a href="03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> during his pontificate.</p>

<p>Even among the many cares of his pontificate he found time for continued literary activity. Two important works of his were either entirely or partly written during this period: his geographical and ethnographical description of <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> and <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>; and his "Memoirs", which are the only autobiography left us by a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. They are entitled "Pii II Commentarii rerum memorabilium, quae temporibus suis contigerunt". Earlier in his life he had written, besides "Eurialus and Lucretia" and the recently discovered comedy "Chrysis", the following historical works: "Libellus dialogorum de generalis concilii auctoritate et gestis Basileensium"; "Commentarius de rebus Basileae gestis"; "Historia rerum Frederici III imperatoris"; "Historia Bohemica". Imcomplete collections of his works were published in 1551 and 1571 at Basle. A critical edition of his letters by Wolkan is in course of publication.</p>
