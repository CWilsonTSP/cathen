<p>An <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> <em>nullius</em> situated about eighty miles south of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the cradle of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>.</p>

<p>About 529 <a href="02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a> left <a href="14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, to escape the persecutions of the <a href="08326b.htm">jealous</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, Florentius. Accompanied by a chosen band, among them Sts. <a href="10072a.htm">Maurus</a> and <a href="12142b.htm">Placid</a>, he journeyed to Monte Cassino, one of the <a href="12462a.htm">properties</a> made over to him by Tertullus, <a href="12142b.htm">St. Placid's</a> father. The town of Cassinum (Cassino), lying at the foot of the mountain, had been destroyed by the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> some thirty-five years earlier, but a <a href="14495a.htm">temple</a> of Apollo still <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> the summit of the mountain, and the few remaining inhabitants were still sunk in <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. <a href="02467b.htm">Benedict's</a> first act was to break the image of Apollo and destroy the altar, on the site of which he built a <a href="02781a.htm">church</a> dedicated to <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, and an <a href="11271a.htm">oratory</a> in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>. Around the <a href="14495a.htm">temple</a> there was an enclosing wall with towers at intervals, the <em>arx</em> (citadel) of the destroyed city of Cassinum. In one of these towers the <a href="02467b.htm">saint</a> took up his abode, and to this fact its preservation is due, for, while the rest of the Roman arx has been destroyed, this tower has been carefully preserved and enclosed in the later buildings. Outside the existing <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, however, there still remains a considerable part of a far more ancient enclosure, viz. a cyclopean wall some twenty-six feet high and fourteen and a half feet in thickness, which once ran down the mountain side enclosing a large triangular space that contained the Cassinum of pre-Roman times.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Once established at Monte Cassino, <a href="02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a> never left it. There was written the <a href="02436a.htm">Rule</a> whose influence was to spread over all <a href="10472a.htm">Western monachism</a>; there he received the visit of Totila in 542, the only date in his life of which we have certain evidence; there he died, and was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in one <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> with his sister, St. Scholastica. After the <a href="02467b.htm">saint's</a> death, the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> continued to flourish until 580, when it was pillaged and burned by the <a href="09336b.htm">Lombards</a>, the surviving <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> fleeing to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Here, welcomed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a>, and permitted to establish a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> beside the <a href="09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>, they remained for a hundred and thirty years, during which time Monte Cassino seems not to have been entirely deserted, though nothing like a regular community existed there. To this period also is assigned the much discussed translation of <a href="02467b.htm">St. Benedict's</a> body to <a href="06102c.htm">Fleury</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of which it seems almost impossible to <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>.</p>

<p>The restoration of Monte Cassino took place in 718, when Abbot Petronax, a native of <a href="02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, was entrusted with this task by <a href="06787a.htm">Gregory II</a>. Aided by some of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> from the <a href="09014b.htm">Lateran</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, Petronax restored the buildings at Monte Cassino and built a new church over the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a>. This was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 748 by <a href="15743b.htm">Pope Zachary</a> in person, who at the same time confirmed all the gifts made to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and exempted it from episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The fame of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> at this period was great, and, among the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> professed, may be mentioned Carloman, the son of <a href="03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, Rachis, brother of the great <a href="09336b.htm">Lombard</a> <a href="01237d.htm">Duke Astolf</a>, and Paul Warnefrid (usually called <a href="11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a>), the historian of the <a href="09336b.htm">Lombards</a>. Towards the middle of the ninth century the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> overran this part of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Monte Cassino did not escape. In 884 Abbot Bertharius and some of his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were killed, the rest fleeing to Teano. Within two years the restoration of Monte Cassino was begun, but Teano retained the bulk of the community until 949, when Abbot Aligernus effected the return. The autograph copy of <a href="02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a>, which had been preserved till now through all the vicissitudes of the community's existence, perished in a fire during the stay at Teano. The high state of <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> at Monte Cassino about this time is vouched for by <a href="11080a.htm">St. Nilus</a>, who visited it in the latter half of the tenth century and again by <a href="11207c.htm">St. Odilo of Cluny</a> some fifty years later. The <a href="01010a.htm">abbey's</a> reputation reached its zenith, however, during the reign of Abbot Desiderius, who ruled from 1058 until 1087, when he was <a href="11456a.htm">elected</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the title of <a href="15410a.htm">Victor III</a>. Under this <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, the most famous of all the series after <a href="02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a> himself, the number of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> rose to over two hundred, and the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of copyists and miniature <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a> became famous throughout the West. The buildings of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> were reconstructed on a scale of great magnificence, artists being brought from <a href="01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, and even Constantinople to supervise the various works. The <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, rebuilt and decorated with the utmost splendour, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1071 by <a href="01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a>, who was assisted by ten <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, forty-four <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and so vast a crowd of princes, <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, etc. that, the enthusiastic chronicler declares, "it would have been easier to number the stars of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> than to count so great a multitude." A detailed account of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> at this <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> exists in the "Chronica monasterii Cassinensis" of Leo of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a> (see Pertz, "Mon. Germ. Hist. Scriptores", VII).</p>

<p>From this date a decline set in. The unsettled condition of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the great strategical value of Monte Cassino involved the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> in the constant political struggles of the period. In 1239 the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were driven out of their <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> by <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, but returned thither under Charles of Anjou. In 1294 <a href="03479b.htm">Celestine V</a> endeavoured to unite Monte Cassino to his new order of <a href="16019a.htm">Celestines</a>, but this scheme collapsed on his abdication of the <a href="11451b.htm">papacy</a>. In 1321 <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> made the church of Monte Cassino a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> becoming <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the newly constituted diocese, and his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> the chapter. There is no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this was done with the best of intentions, as an additional <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> to the great <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>; in practice, however, it <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> disastrous. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Monte Cassino, nominated at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, were secular <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> who never visited the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but who appropriated the income of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> to their personal use. The number of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> thus dwindled, the observance declined, and utter ruin became a mere question of time. In view of this danger <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a>, who was a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, proclaimed himself <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Monte Cassino, collected <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> from other houses to reinforce the community, and in 1370 appointed Andrew of <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, a <a href="03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>, as superior. The revival, however, was short-lived; in 1454 the system of <a href="04155b.htm">commendatory abbots</a> was reintroduced and lasted until 1504, when <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a> united Monte Cassino to the recently established Congregation of St. Justina of Padua (<em>see</em> <a href="02443a.htm">BENEDICTINES</a>), which was thenceforth known as the Cassinese Congregation. In 1799 the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> was taken and plundered by the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> troops who had invaded the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, and in 1866 the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was suppressed in common with all other <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a>. At the present day Monte Cassino is the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> Government, which has declared it a national monument; the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, however, is recognized as Guardian in view of his administration of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The reigning <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> [1911] is Dom Gregorio Diamare (elected 1909); the community (1909) consists of thirty-seven choir <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and thirty <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>. The vast buildings contain, besides the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, a lay <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> with 126 boarders and two <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, one open to all and the other reserved for the Diocese of Monte Cassino with 76 and 50 pupils respectively. In the management of these institutions the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> are assisted by a number of <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The present buildings form a vast rectangular pile externally more massive than beautiful. The ancient tower of <a href="02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a>, now a series of <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> elaborately decorated by monastic artists of the Beuron <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, is the only portion dating back to the foundation of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The entrance gate leads to three square court-yards opening out of one another with arcades in the Doric order. These date from 1515 and are attributed, on somewhat slight evidence, to <a href="02736a.htm">Bramante</a>. From the middle court-yard an immense flight of steps leads to the atrium or forecourt of the basilica. This quadrangle has an arcade supported by ancient columns taken from the basilica of Abbot Desiderius, and probably once in the destroyed temple of Apollo on the site of which the present church stands. The existing church, the fourth to occupy the site, is from the designs of Cosimo Fansaga. It was begun in 1649, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1727 by <a href="02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. In richness of marbles, the interior is said to be surpassed only by the Certosa at <a href="11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, and the first impression is certainly one of astonishing magnificence. On closer inspection, however, the style is found to be somewhat decadent, especially in the plasterwork of the ceiling, while the enormous profusion of inlaid marble and gilding produces a slightly restless effect. Still it is undoubtedly the finest example of Florentine <a href="10584a.htm">mosaic</a> work in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the general colour scheme is excellent. The church is cruciform in plan, with a <a href="05100b.htm">dome</a> at the crossing, beneath which is the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a>. Behind this altar is the choir with its elaborately carved stalls. The <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a> is in a <a href="04558a.htm">crypt</a> <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> beneath the eastern portion of the church, but it is extremely <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether any <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="02467b.htm">saint</a> now remain there. This <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> has recently been decorated with <a href="10584a.htm">mosaics</a> from designs by artists of the Beuron <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, the severity of which contrasts markedly with the slightly <a href="13106a.htm">Rococo</a> <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="06564b.htm">Luca Giordano</a> in the church above. The <a href="13322b.htm">sacristy</a> contains the ancient pavement of <em>opus alexandrinum</em>, which was formerly in the basilica of Abbot Desiderius. In the left <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a> is the monument of Pietro di Medici, son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and brother of <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a>. This <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a>, which is by the great architect Antonio di <a href="13443a.htm">Sangallo</a>, is unquestionably the most beautiful and dignified work in the whole building. The great west door, a bronze piece of the twelfth century, is engraved with the names of all the <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Diocese of Monte Cassino. The kitchens are approached from the ground-floor by a long covered passage on an inclined plane, large enough for two mules laden with provisions to pass. This curious structure dates from the twelfth century and is lit by an exquisite marble window of four arches in the style known as Cosmatesque. The buildings as a whole produce an effect of great dignity and magnificence, all the more unexpected from the inaccessible position of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and the extreme severity of the exterior. The view from the "Loggia del Paradiso" or forecourt, is one of the most famous in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>

<p>The archives (<em>archivium</em>), besides a vast number of documents relating to the history of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, contains some 1400 <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a> chiefly patristic and historical, many of which are of the greatest value. The <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> contains a fine collection of modern texts and <em>apparatus criticus</em>, which is always most courteously put at the disposal of scholars who come to work on the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. When the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> was declared a national monument, orders were given to transport the whole collection of <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> to the National Library at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>; but, owing to the personal intercession of Mr. Gladstone, then Prime Minister of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, the order was reversed, and instead one of the community was appointed as Archivist with a salary from the Government, an arrangement which still continues.</p>

<p>The Diocese of Monte Cassino includes most of the Abruzzi, and is one of the most extensive in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It was formed by uniting seven ancient <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, a fact which is borne in mind by the interesting custom that, when the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> sings pontifical High Mass, he uses seven different precious mitres in succession. As ordinary the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> is directly subject to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and the choir <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> take rank as the <a href="03582b.htm">chapter</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, of which the abbatial basilica of Monte Cassino is the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The conferring of <a href="11279a.htm">sacred orders</a>, blessing of Holy Oils, and administration of the <a href="04215b.htm">Sacrament of Confirmation</a> are the only pontifical functions which the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> does not exercise. The <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> is usually one of the community.</p>
