<p>Innsbruck University, officially the ROYAL IMPERIAL LEOPOLD FRANCIS UNIVERSITY IN INNSBRUCK, originated in the college opened at Innsbruck in 1562 by <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11756c.htm&quot;">Peter Canisius</a>, at the request and on the foundation of the Emperor Ferdinand I of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who in this way made effective his long-cherished plans for an institute of higher learning for the people of Tyrol. The imperial edict of foundation was read from every <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> in Tyrol on 12 May, 1562, and the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> opened under the direction of the Fathers of the newly founded <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> on 24 June of the same year as a gymnasium with four classes, in which elements, grammar, and syntax were taught. A fifth and lowest class of elements was added in 1566. In 1599 Ferdinand expressed the wish that the programme of studies be widened so as to include a <em>studium universale</em>. This was done, however, only in 1606, when a new building for the gymnasium was completed, whereupon courses in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> (dialectics) and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> (casuistry and controversies) were begun, the other subjects being rhetoric, humanities, syntax, and upper and lower grammar. <a href="09324a.htm">Logic</a> was added in 1619. Until 1670 the erecting of the gymnasium into a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> had been repeatedly discussed and planned, but without result. In 1670-71 the course in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was extended to three years; in 1671-72 two chairs of <a href="13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a> were founded, as well as one of law (institutiones) and in the following year two of <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> and one of canon law. In 1672 also the gymnasium was raised to the rank of an academy, and in 1673 this academy received the name and rank of a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, although lectures in medicine did not begin until 1674.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The Emperor Leopold I of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the imperial <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of foundation in 1677, and it was in the same year that <a href="08021a.htm">Pope Innocent XI</a> granted the new <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> the customary <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges. The faculty then consisted of fifteen professors: five for <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, four each for philosophy and law, and two for medicine. Of these, three of the professors of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, all of those of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and the professor of canon law in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> faculty were <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; two members of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> lectured in the first-named faculty, and the rest were <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The complete organization of these four faculties followed ten years later. The chancellor of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was the Prince-Bishop of <a href="02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, in the Tyrol, who was usually represented in Innsbruck by a vice-chancellor. Until 1730 the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> remained essentially unchanged. The number of professors rose to eighteen. The eighteen years following, however, witnessed a widening of the study plan; the Government of <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> began to interfere more directly in the inner work of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. During the next period, from 1748 to 1773, this state domination increased, reaching a maximum under <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. In 1773 when, upon the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who up to this had made up one-half of the professors and under whom the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty became the most eminent of the four, ceased to lecture, the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> numbered 911 students, distributed as follows: 325 in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, 116 in law, 43 in medicine and 437 in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</p>

<p><a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> published an order for the suppression of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> on 29 November, 1781, but on 14 September, 1782 issued a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> allowing it to be continued as a lyceum with two <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> faculties, philosophy and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and facilities for the study of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and medicine. In 1783 the Government established at Innsbruck a general <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the whole of Tyrol, only to close it again in 1790. The <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was recalled to life by Joseph's successor, Leopold II, to be again suppressed by the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Government in 1810, leaving a lyceum with merely <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> courses. This condition of affairs lasted until 1817, when courses in law and medicine were added. From the departure of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1773 until 1822, when it was completely suppressed, the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, in which the principles of Josephinism and Gallicanism reigned almost supreme, ad been in continual conflict with the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, who had no right of supervision, not even over purity of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which suffered grievously in the interval. At one time even the <a href="07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a> was a forbidden book. In 1826 the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was again restored, this time by the Emperor Francis II of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. It consisted at first of only two full faculties, philosophy and law. In 1857, mainly through the efforts of Vincent Gasser, Prince-Bishop of <a href="02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty was added and entrusted once more to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who have since, with two exceptions, been the sole professors. The complete organization of the restored <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was reached when the medical faculty was reconstituted in 1869.</p>

<p>The most illustrious teachers of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> have been and are mainly in the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty. Since the restoration of the latter in 1857 the best known of these have been: in <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, Cardinal Steinhuber (died 1907), Stentrup (died 1898), Kern (died 1907), and <a href="07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, the latter still lecturing since 1858; in <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, Noldin (retired 1909); in sacred eloquence, <a href="08566c.htm">Jungmann</a> (died 1885), the author of a well-known work on &aelig;sthetics; in <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and sociology, Biederlack; in canon law and <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, <a href="11078a.htm">Nilles</a> (died 1907); in Scripture, Fonck (called to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1908); in <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, Grisar (professor honorarius since 1898). Dr. Ludwig von Pastor, author of the well-known "History of the Popes", is professor of history in the faculty of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, in which the eminent Austrian meteorologist <a href="11697b.htm">Pernter</a> (died 1909) was at one time professor. To this faculty belongs also the cartographer von Wieser. The <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty has frequently suffered the attacks of "liberal" professors, who form the large majority in the faculties of the profane <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> in the Austrian <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>. These professors have several times endeavoured to have the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty suppressed, but it has ever found a faithful protector in the Emperor Francis Joseph I. This faculty also took the leading part in the controversy following upon the blasphemous attack on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in 1908 by Dr. Ludwig Wahrmund, professor of canon law in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> faculty.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Intimately connected with the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, though no official part of it, is the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> (Theologisches Konvikt), where the majority of the students of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> reside. This institution, called the "Nikolaihaus", was first opened for poor students in 1569, closed in 1783, and reopened for the <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> in 1858. It is almost exclusively through the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty and the "Nikolaihaus" that Innsbruck is known outside of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, especially among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In the fifty years since the restoration of the faculty, 5898 students, from nearly every civilized country, have frequented the lectures in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, of whom 2983 are <em>alumni</em> of the "Nikolaihaus". Of these students, 4209 belonged to the secular and 1689 to the <a href="12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>; they represented 202 <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and Apostolic vicariates, and 73 provinces, <a href="04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, etc., of the regulars. North America has contributed 443 students, with few exceptions all from the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>; <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> is represented among the <em>alumni</em> by 10, and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> by 15 students. The "Nikolaihaus" is governed by a <em>regens</em> who is a member of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. A <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit father</a> also is always <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> preacher, and the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> sodality is under the direction of another <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. Innsbruck is the theologate of the Austrian and Hungarian provinces of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. The influence of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> since its restoration, as in its earlier periods, has been important. Naturally this influence has been felt most of all in the Tyrol, which to a large extent owes to the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> its culture, especially among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and in the medical and legal professions. In particular, the presence of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students from all parts of the world has made the influence of the faculty of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of great weight in the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and in the development of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a> during the last fifty years, an influence which has been spread and augmented by the faculty organ, the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Katholische Theologie", a quarterly now in its thirty-third year. Innsbruck is one of the eight Austrian state <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>. The <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> buildings number about 40 (including institutes clinics etc.). There is also a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> church in charge of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. This church was erected during the years 1620-40 by Archduke Leopold V of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and his wife Claudia de' Medici. The buildings for the medical, chemical, and physical <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> are new and well equipped. The <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> contains over 225,000 volumes, including many valuable <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The number of students averages about 1000, that of the professors and <em>privat dozenten</em> over 90. In 1908-09 the number of students registered in the winter semester was 1154, thus distributed: <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, 355; law, 293; medicine, 213; philosophy, 293. In the summer semester (1909) the total was 1062. In this same year there were 105 professors and <em>privat dozenten</em>.</p>
