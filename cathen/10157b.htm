<p>(Melkites).</p>

<h2>Origin and name</h2>

<p>Melchites are the people of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> who remained faithful to the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) when the greater part turned <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>.</p>

<p>The original meaning of the name therefore is an opposition to Monophysism. The <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> had their communities in eastern <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> till the Emperor Zeno (474-491) closed their <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> in 489, and drove them over the frontier into <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>. The people of western <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were either Melchites who accepted Chalcedon, or <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> (also called <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine, <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>) who rejected it, till the <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelite heresy</a> in the seventh century further complicated the situation. But Melchite remained the name for those who were faithful to the great Church, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Orthodox, till the Schism of Photius (867) and <a href="10273a.htm">Cerularius</a> (1054) again divided them. From that time there have been two kinds of Melchites in these countries, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Melchites who kept the communion of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> (Orthodox) Melchites who followed Constantinople and the great mass of <a href="05230a.htm">eastern Christians</a> into <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Although the name has been and still is occasionally used for both these groups, it is now commonly applied only to the Eastern-Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. For the sake of clearness it is better to keep to this use; the name <em>Orthodox</em> is sufficient for the others, whereas among the many groups of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Latin and Eastern, of various rites, we need a special name for this group. It would be, indeed, still more convenient if we could call all Byzantine-Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> "Melchite." But such a use of the word has never obtained. One could not with any propriety call <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, the Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> or Rumania, Melchites. One must therefore keep the name for those of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, all of whom speak Arabic.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>We define a Melchite then as any <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> of these lands in communion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Constantinople, and the great Church of the Empire before the Photian <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, or as a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> of the Byzantine Rite in communion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> since. As the word implied opposition to the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> originally, so it now marks the distinction between these people and all schismatics on the one hand, between them and Latins or <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of other rites (<a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="14399a.htm">Syrians</a>, etc.) on the other. The name is easily explained philologically. It is a <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a> (presumably Syriac) root with a Greek ending, meaning <em>imperialist.</em> <em>Melk</em> is Syriac for king (<a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>melek</em>, <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a>. <em>malik</em>). The word is used in all the <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a> languages for the Roman Emperor, like the Greek <em>basileus</em>. By adding the Greek ending &#151; <em>ites</em> we have the form <em>melkites</em>, equal to <em>basilikos</em>. It should be noted that the third radical of the <a href="13706a.htm">Semitic</a> root is <em>kaf</em>: there is no guttural. Therefore the correct form of the word is <em>Melkite</em>, rather than the usual form Melchite. The pure Syriac word is <em>malkoyo</em> (Arab. <em>malakiyyu</em>; vulgar, <em>milkiyyu</em>).</p>

<h2 id="section2">History before the Schism</h2>

<p>The decrees of the Fourth General Council (Chalcedon, 451) were unpopular in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and still more in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Monophysism began as an exaggeration of the teaching of <a href="04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (d. 444), the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> national hero, against Nestorius. In the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> the Egyptians and their friends in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> saw a betrayal of Cyril, a concession to <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. Still more did national, anti-imperial feeling cause opposition to it. The Emperor Marcian (450-457) made the Faith of Chalcedon the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the empire. Laws passed on 27 February and again on 13 March, 452, enforced the decrees of the council and threatened heavy penalties against dissenters. From that time Dyophysism was the religion of the court, identified with loyalty to the emperor. In spite of the compromising concessions of later emperors, the Faith of Chalcedon was always looked upon as the religion of the state, demanded and enforced on all subjects of Caesar. So the long-smouldering disloyalty of these two provinces broke out in the form of rebellion against Chalcedon. For centuries (till the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquest) Monophysism was the symbol of national <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and Syrian patriotism. The root of the matter was always political. The people of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, keeping their own languages and their consciousness of being separate races, had never been really amalgamated with the Empire, originally Latin, now fast becoming Greek. They had no chance of political independence, their <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> found a vent in this <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> question. The cry of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of Cyril, "one nature in Christ", no betrayal of Ephesus, meant really no submission to the foreign tyrant on the Bosphorus. So the great majority of the population in these lands turned <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, rose in continual rebellion against the creed of the Empire, committed savage atrocities against the Chalcedonian <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and officials, and in return were fiercely <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a>.</p>

<p>The beginning of these troubles in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was the deposition of the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Patriarch <a href="05019a.htm">Dioscur</a>, and the election by the government party of Proterius as his successor, immediately after the council. The people, especially the lower classes and the great crowd of <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, refused to acknowledge Proterius, and began to make tumults and riots that 2000 soldiers sent from Constantinople could hardly put down. When <a href="05019a.htm">Dioscur</a> died in 454 a certain Timothy, called the Cat or Weasel (<em>ailouros</em>), was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> as his successor. In 457 Proterius was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>; Timothy drove out the Chalcedonian <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and so began the organized Coptic (<a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>) Church of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. In <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine there was the same opposition to the council and the government. The people and <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> drove out the Orthodox <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Martyrius, and set up one Peter the Dyer (<em>gnapheus, fullo</em>), a <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> as his successor. Juvenal of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, once a friend of <a href="05019a.htm">Dioscur</a>, gave up his <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> at Chalcedon. When he came back to his new <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> he found the whole country in rebellion against him. He too was driven out and a <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> Theodosius was set up in his place. So began the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> national churches of these provinces. Their opposition to the court and rebellion lasted two centuries, till the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquest (Syria, 637; <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, 641). During this time the government, realizing the danger of the disaffection of the frontier provinces, alternated fierce <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> with vain attempts to conciliate them by compromises (Zeno's Henotikon in 482, the <a href="01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="13529a.htm">Schism</a>, 484-519, etc.) It should be realized that <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was much more consistently <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> than <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> or Palestine. <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was much closer knit as one land than the other provinces, and so stood more uniformly on the side of the national party. (For all this see MONOPHYSISM.)</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Meanwhile against the nationalist party stood the minority on the side of the government and the council. These are the Melchites. Why they were so-called is obvious: they were the loyal Imperialists, the emperor's party. The name occurs first in a pure Greek form as <em>basilikos</em>. <a href="05639b.htm">Evagrius</a> says of Timothy Sakophakiolos (The Orthodox <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> set up by the government when Timothy the Cat was driven out in 460) that some called him the Imperialist (<em>on oi men ekaloun basilikon</em>) (H.E., II,11). These Melchites were naturally for the most part the government officials, in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> almost entirely so, while in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine a certain part of the native population was Melchite too. Small in numbers, they were until the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquest strong through the support of the government and the army. The contrast between <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and Melchites (Nationalists and Imperialists) was expressed in their language. The <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> spoke the national language of the country (Coptic in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Syriac in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine), Melchites for the most part were foreigners sent out from Constantinople who spoke Greek. For a long time the history of these countries is that of a continual feud between Melchites and <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>; sometimes the government is strong, the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> are <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> is occupied by a Melchite; then again the people get the upper hand, drive out the Melchite <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, set up <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> in their place and <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> the Greeks. By the time of the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquest the two Churches exist as rivals with rival lines of bishops. But the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> are much the larger party, especially in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and form the national religion of the country. The difference by new expresses itself to a great extent in <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language. Both parties used the same <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a> (St. Mark in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, St. James in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine), but while the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> made a point of using the national language in church (Coptic and Syriac) the Melchites generally used Greek. It seems, however, that this was less the case than has been thought; the Melchites, too, used the vulgar tongue to a considerable extent (Charon, <em>Le Rite byzantin</em>, 26-29).</p>

<p>When the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> came in the seventh century, the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> to their anti-imperial policy, rather helped than hindered the invaders. But they gained little by their treason; both churches received the usual terms granted to <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>; they became two <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> of Rayas under the <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a> Khalifa, both were equally <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> during the repeated outbursts of <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a> fanaticism, of which the reign of Al-Hakim in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (996-1021) is the best known instance. In the tenth century part of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> was conquered back by the empire (Antioch reconquered in 968-969, lost again to the Seljuk <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1078-1081). This caused for a time a revival of the Melchites and an increase of enthusiasm for Constantinople and everything Greek among them. Under the <a href="10424a.htm">Moslems</a> the characteristic notes of both churches became, if possible, stronger. The <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> (Copts and <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>) sank into isolated local <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>. On the other hand, the Melchite minorities clung all the more to their union with the great church that reigned free and dominant in the empire. This expressed itself chiefly in loyalty to Constantinople. <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the West were far off; the immediate object of their devotion was the emperor's court and the emperor's patriarch. The Melchite <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> under <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a> rule became insignificant people, while the power of the Patriarach of Constantinople grew steadily. So, looking always to the capital for guidance, they gradually accepted the position of being his dependents, almost suffragans. When the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople assumed the title of "Ecumenical Patriarch" it was not his Melchite brothers who protested. This attitude explains their share in his <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. The quarrels between Photius and <a href="11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a>, between <a href="10273a.htm">Michael Cerularius</a> and <a href="09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> were not their affair; they hardly understood what was happening. But naturally, almost inevitably, when the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> broke out, in spite of some protests [Peter III of Antioch (1053-1076?) protested vehemently against <a href="10273a.htm">Cerularius's</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>; see Fortescue, <em>Orthodox <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a></em>, 189-192], the Melchites followed their leader, and when orders came from Constantinople to strike the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> name from their <a href="05022a.htm">diptychs</a> they quietly obeyed.</p>

<h2 id="section3">From the Schism to the beginning of the Union</h2>

<p>So all the Melchites in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> broke with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and went into <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> at the command of Constantinople. Here, too, they justified their name of Imperialist. From this time to almost our own day there is little to chronicle of their history. They existed as a "nation" (<em>millet</em>) under the Khalifa; when the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> took Constantinople (1453) they made the patriarch of that city head of this "nation" (<em>Rum millet</em>, i.e., the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>) for civil affairs. Other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or even <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, could only approach the government through him. This further increased his authority and influence over all the Orthodox in the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire. During the dark ages that follow, the Ecumenical Patriarch continually strove (and generally managed) to assert <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> over the Melchites (Ort. Eastern Ch., 240, 285-289, 310, etc.). Meanwhile the three <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> (of Alexandria, <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>), finding little to do among their diminished flocks, for long periods came to live at Constantinople, idle ornaments of the Phanar. The lists of these <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> will be found in <a href="09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (loc. cit. Below). Gradually all the people of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and Palestine since the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> conquest forgot their original languages and spoke only Arabic, as they do still. This further affected their <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. Little by little Arabic began to be used in church. Since the seventeenth century at the latest, the native Orthodox of these countries use Arabic for all services, though the great number of Greeks among them keep their own language.</p>

<p>But already a much more important change in the liturgy of the Melchites had taken place. We have seen that the most characteristic note of these communities was their dependence on Constantinople. That was the difference between them and their old rivals the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, long after the quarrel about the nature of Christ had practically been forgotten. The <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, isolated from the rest of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, kept the old rites of Alexandria and Antioch-Jerusalem pure. They still use these rites in the old languages (Coptic and Syriac). The Melchites on the other hand submitted to Byzantine influence in their <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. The Byzantine <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a> (<em>Synaptai</em>), the service of the Ptoskomide and other elements were introduced into the Greek Alexandrine Rite before the twelfth or thirteenth centuries; so also in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine the Melchites admitted a number of Byzantine elements into their services (Charon, op. Cit., 9-25).</p>

<p>Then in the thirteenth century came the final change. The Melchites gave up their old rites altogether and adopted that of Constantinople. <a href="02226b.htm">Theodore IV (Balsamon)</a> of Antioch (1185-1214?) marks the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of this change. The <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> held Antioch in his name, so he retired to Constantinople and lived there under the shadow of the Ecumenical Patriarch. While he was there he adopted the Byzantine Rite. In 1203, Mark II of Alexandria (1195-c. 1210) wrote to Theodore asking various questions about the liturgy. Theodore in his answer insists on both churches received the usual terms granted to <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>; they became two <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> of Rayas under the <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a> Khalifa, both were equally <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> during the repeated outbursts of <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a> fanaticism, of which the reign of Al-Hakim in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (996-1021) is the best known instance. In the tenth century part of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> was conquered back by the empire (Antioch reconquered in 968-969, lost again to the Seljuk <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1078-1081). This caused for a time a revival of the Melchites and an increase of enthusiasm for Constantinople and everything Greek among them. Under the <a href="10424a.htm">Moslems</a> the characteristic notes of both churches became, if possible, stronger. The <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> (Copts and <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>) sank into isolated local <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>. On the other hand, the Melchite minorities clung all the more to their union with the great church that reigned free and dominant in the empire. This expressed itself chiefly in loyalty to Constantinople <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the West were far off; the immediate object of their devotion was the emperor's court and the use of Constantinople as the only right one, for all the Orthodox, and Mark undertook to adopt it (P.G., CXXXVIII, 935 sq.) When Thheodosius IV of Antioch (1295-1276) was able to set up his throne again in his own city he imposed the Byzantine Rite on all his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. At <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the old liturgy disappeared at about the same time. (Charon, op. Cit., 11-12, 21, 23).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>We have then for the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of the Melchites these periods: first the old national rites in Greek, but also in the languages of the country, especially in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine, gradually Byzantinized till the thirteenth century. Then the Byzantine Rite alone in Greek in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in Greek and Syriac in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Palestine, with gradually increasing use of Arabic to the sixteenth or seventeenth century. Lastly the same rite in Arabic only by the natives, in Greek by the foreign (Greek) <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<p>The last development we notice is the steady increase of this foreign (Greek) element in all the higher places of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. As the Phanar at Constantinople grew more and more powerful over the Melchites, so did it more and more, in ruthless defiance of the feeling of the people, send them Greek <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, and archimandrites from its own body. For centuries the lower married <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and simple <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> have been natives, speaking Arabic and using Arabic in the liturgy, while all the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> have been Greeks, who often do not even <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the language of the country. At last, in our own time, the native Orthodox have rebelled against this state of things. At Antioch they have now succeeded in the recognition of their native Patriarch, Gregory IV (Hadad) after a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> with Constantinople. The troubles caused by the same movement at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> are still fresh in everyone's mind. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that as soon as the present Greek <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Damianos V) and Alexandria (Photios) die, there will be a determined effort to appoint natives as their successors. But these quarrels affect the modern Orthodox of these lands who do not come within the limit of this article inasmuch as they are no longer Melchites.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Eastern-rite Catholics</h2>

<p>We have said that in modern times since the foundation of Byzantine <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, only these Uniates should be called Melchites. Why the old name is now reserved for them it is impossible to say. It is, however, a fact that it is so. One still occasionally in a western book finds all <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the Byzantine Rite in these countries called Melchites, with a further distinction between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Orthodox Melchites; but the present writer's experience is that this is never the case among themselves. The man in union with the great <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> in those parts never now calls himself or allows himself to be called a Melchite. He is simply "Orthodox" in Greek or any Western language, <em>Rumi</em> in Arabic. Everyone there understands by <em>Melchite</em> a Uniate. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that even for them the word is not very commonly used. They are more likely to speak of themselves as <em>rumi kathuliki</em> or in French <em>Grecs catholiques</em>; but the name <em>Melchite</em>, if used at all, always means to Eastern people these <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It is convenient for us too to have a definite name for them less entirely wrong than "Greek <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>" for they are Greeks in no sense at all. A question that has often been raised is whether there is any continuity of these Byzantine <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> since before the great <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, whether there are any communities that have never lost communion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There are such communities certainly in the south of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and <a href="04396b.htm">Corsica</a>. In the case of the Melchite lands there are none. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that there have been approaches to reunion continually since the eleventh century, individual <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> have made their submission at various times, the short-lived unions of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (1274) and Florence (1439) included the Orthodox of these countries too. But there is no continuous line; when the union of Florence was broken all the <a href="05230a.htm">Byzantine Christians</a> in the East fell away. The present Melchite Church dates from the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Already in the seventeenth century tentative efforts at reunion were made by some of the Orthodox <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>. A certain Euthymius, <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon, then the Antiochene Patriarchs <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> IV (1700-1728) and the famous Cyril of Berrhoea (d. 1724, the rival of Cyril Lukaris of Constantinople, who for a time was rival <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>) approached the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and hoped to receive the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a>. But the professions of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> which they submitted were considered insufficient at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The latinizing tendency of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> was so well known that in 1722 a synod was held at Constantinople which drew up and sent to the Antiochene <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> a warning letter with a list of Latin <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> (in Assemani, "Bibl. Orient.", III, 639). However, in 1724 <a href="13725b.htm">Seraphim</a> Tanas, who had studied at the Roman <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, was elected <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> by the latinizing party. He at once made his submission to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and sent a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. He took the name Cyril (Cyril VI, 1274-1759); with him begins the line of Melchite <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> in the new sense (Uniates). In 1728 the schismatics elected Sylvester, a Greek <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> from <a href="02047b.htm">Athos</a>. He was recognized by the Phanar and the other Orthodox churches; through him the Orthodox line continues. Cyril VI suffered considerable <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> from the Orthodox, and for a time had to flee to the Lebanon. He received the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in 1744. In 1760, wearied by the continual struggle against the Orthodox majority, he resigned his office. Ignatius Jauhar was appointed to succeed him, but the appointment was rejected at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> appointed Maximus Hakim, <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="02177a.htm">Baalbek</a>, as patriarch (Maximus II, 1760-1761). <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> Dahan of Beruit succeeded by regular election and confirmation after Maximus's death and became Theodosius VI (1761-1788). But in 1764 Ignatius Jauhar succeeded in being re-elected patriarch. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, and persuaded the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> authorities to drive him out. In 1773 <a href="04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> united the few scattered Melchites of Alexandria and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Melchite patriarch of Antioch. When Theodosius VI died, Ignatius Jauhar was again elected, this time lawfully, and took the name Athanasius V (1788-1794).</p>

<p>Then followed Cyril VII (Siage, 1794-1796), Agapius III (Matar, formerly <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon, patriarch 1796-1812). During this time there was a movement of Josephinism and <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> in the sense of the synod of Pistoia (1786) among the Melchites, led by Germanus Adam, <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="02177a.htm">Baalbek</a>. This movement for a time invaded nearly all the Melchite Church. In 1806 they held a synod at Qarqafe which approved many of the <a href="12116c.htm">Pistoian</a> decrees. The acts of the synod were published without authority from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in Arabic in 1810; in 1835 they were censured at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> had already condemned a <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a> and other works written by Germanus of <a href="02177a.htm">Baalbek</a>. Among his <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> was the Orthodox theory that <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> is not effected by the words of institution in the liturgy. Eventually the patriarch (Agapius) and the other Melchite <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were persuaded to renounce these <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. In 1812 another synod established a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Ain-Traz for the Melchite "nation." The next <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were Ignatius IV (Sarruf, Feb.-Nov., 1812, <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>), <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> VI (Matar, 1813), Macarius IV (Tawil, 1813-1815), Ignatius V (Qattan, 1816-1833). He was followed by the famous Maximus III (Mazlum, 1833-1855). His former name was Michael. He had been infected with the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Germanus of <a href="02177a.htm">Baalbek</a>, and had been elected <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, but his election had not been confirmed at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Then he renounced these <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> and became titular <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="10661a.htm">Myra</a>, and <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> of his patriarch at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. During this time he founded the Melchite church at <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (St. Nicholas), and took steps at the courts of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> to protect the Melchites from their Orthodox rivals.</p>

<p>Hitherto the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> government had not recognized the Uniates as a separate <em>millet</em>; so all their communications with the State, the <em>berat</em> given to their <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and so on, had to be made through the Orthodox. They were still officially, in the eyes of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, members of the <em>rum millet</em>, that is of the Orthodox community under the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. This naturally gave the Orthodox endless opportunities of annoying them, which were not lost. In 1831 Mazlum went back to <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, in 1833 after the death of Ignatius V he was elected patriarch, and was confirmed at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> after many difficulties in 1836. His reign was full of disputes. In 1835 he held a <a href="14389a.htm">national synod</a> at Ain-Traz, which laid down twenty-five canons for the regulation of the affairs of the Melchite Church; the synod was approved at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and is published in the Collectio Lacensis (II, 579-592). During his reign at last the Melchites obtained recognition as a separate <em>millet</em> from the Porte. Maximus III obtained from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for himself and his successors the additional titles of Alexandria and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which sees his predecessors had administered since Theodosius VI. In 1849 he held a synod at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in which he renewed many of the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of Germanus Adam. Thus he got into new difficulties with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as well as with his people. But these difficulties were gradually composed and the old patriarch died in peace in 1855. He is the most famous of the line of Melchite <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. He was succeeded by Clement I (Bahus, 1856-1864), Gregory II (Yussef, 1865-1879), Peter IV (Jera&iuml;jiri, 1897-1902), and Cyril VIII (Jeha, the reigning patriarch, who was elected 27 June, 1903, confirmed at once by telegram from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in the patriarchal church at <a href="04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, 8 August, 1903).</p>

<h2 id="section5">Constitution of the Melchite Church</h2>

<p>The head of the Melchite church, under the supreme authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, is the patriarch. His title is "Patriarch of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Alexandria, <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and all the East." "Antioch and all the East" is the old title used by all <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Antioch. It is less arrogant than it sounds; the "East" means the original Roman Prefecture of the East (<em>Praefectura Orentis</em>) which corresponded exactly to the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> before the rise of Constantinople (Fortescue, <em>Orth. <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a></em>, 21). Alexandria and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> were added to the title under Maximus III. It should be noted that these come after Antioch, although normally Alexandria has precedence over it. This is because the patriarch is fundamentally of Antioch only; he traces his succession through Cyril VI to the old line of Antioch. He is in some sort only the administrator of Alexandria and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> until the number of Melchites in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Palestine shall justify the erection of separate <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> for them. Meanwhile he rules equally over his nation in the three provinces. There is also a grander title used in Polychronia and for special solemn occasions in which he is acclaimed as "father of Fathers, Shepherd of Shepherds, <a href="12407b.htm">High</a> Priest of <a href="12407b.htm">High</a> Priests and Thirteenth Apostle."</p>

<p>The patriarch is elected by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and is nearly always chosen from their number. The election is submitted to the Congregation for <a href="04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a> joined to <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>; if it is canonical the patriarch-elect sends a profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and a petition for confirmation and for the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. He must also take an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of obedience to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. If the election is invalid, <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> devolves on the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The patriarch may not resign without the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent. He must make his visit <em>ad limina</em>, personally or by deputy, every ten years. The patriarch has ordinary <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all his church. He confirms the election of and consecrates all <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; he can translate or depose them, according to the canons. He founds <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and (with consent of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>) <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and has considerable <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the nature of <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> and so on. The patriarch resides at the house next to the patriarchal church at <a href="04611a.htm">Damascus</a> (near the Eastern Gate). He has also residences at Alexandria and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, where he spends at least some weeks each year; he is often at the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Ain-Traz, not far from <a href="02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, in the Lebanon.</p>

<p>The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are chosen according to the bull <em>Reversurus</em>, 12 July, 1867. All the other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in synod with the patriarch choose three names, of which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> selects one. All <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> must be <a href="03481a.htm">celibate</a>, but they are by no means necessarily <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. Priests who are not monks may keep wives married before <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but as in all uniate churches <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> is very common, and the married <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> are looked upon rather askance. There are <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> at Ain-Traz, <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (the College of St. Ann under <a href="09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie's</a> <a href="15613d.htm">White Fathers</a>), <a href="02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, etc. Many students go to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, the Greek College at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or St. Sulpice at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> follow the <a href="02322a.htm">Rule of St. Basil</a>. They are divided into two great congregations, that of St. John the Baptist at Shuweir in the Lebanon and that of St. Saviour, near Sidon. Both have numerous daughter-houses. The Shuweirites have a further distinction, i.e. between those of Allepo and the Baladites. There are also <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>.</p>

<p>Practically all Melchites are natives of the country, <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> in tongue. Their rite is that of Constantinople, almost always celebrated in Arabic with a few versicles and exclamations (<em>proschomen sophia orthoi</em>, etc.) in Greek. But on certain solemn occasions the liturgy is celebrated entirely in Greek.</p>

The total number of Melchites is estimated at 130,000 (Silbernagl) or 114,080 (Werner).</p>
