<p>A celebrated <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and author, b. in the Ch&acirc;teau de F&eacute;nelon in P&eacute;rigord (Dordogne), 6 August, 1651; d. at <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, 7 January, 1715. He came of ancient <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of noble birth but small means, the most famous of his ancestors being Bertrand de Salignac (d. 1599), who fought at <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a> under the Duke <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> and became ambassador to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; also Fran&ccedil;ois de Salignac I, Louis de Salignac I, Louis de Saligac II, and Fran&ccedil;ois de Salignac II, <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sarlat between 1567 and 1688. F&eacute;nelon was the second of the three children of Pons de Salignac, Count de La Mothe-F&eacute;nelon, by his second wife, Louise de La Cropte. Owing to his delicate health F&eacute;nelon's childhood was passed in his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> ch&acirc;teau under a tutor, who succeeded in giving him a keen taste for the classics and a considerable <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek literature, which influenced the development of his mind in marked degree. At the age of twelve he was sent to the neighbouring <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, where he studied rhetoric and philosophy, and obtained his first degrees. As he had already expressed his intention of entering the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, one of his uncles, Marquis Antoine* de F&eacute;nelon, a friend of Monsieur <a href="11240d.htm">Olier</a> and <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, sent him to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and placed him in the Coll&egrave;ge du Plessis, whose students followed the course of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. There F&eacute;nelon became a friend of <a href="11085b.htm">Antoine de Noailles</a>, afterwards, <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and showed such decided talent that at the age of fifteen he was chosen to preach a public sermon, in which he acquitted admirably. To facilitate his preparation for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the marquis sent his nephew to the S&eacute;minaire de Saint-Sulpice (about 1672), then under the direction of Monsieur Tronson, but the young man was placed in the small community reserved for <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> whose health did not permit them to follow the excessive exercises of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. In this famous <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, of which he always retained affectionate memories, F&eacute;nelon was grounded not only in the practice of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> virtue, but above all in solid <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, which saved him later from <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and Gallicanism. Thirty years later, in a letter to <a href="04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, he congratulates himself on his training by M. Tronson in the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his Faith and the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. About 1675 he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and for a while thought of devoting himself to the Eastern missions. This was, however, only a passing inclination. Instead he joined the community of Saint Sulpice and gave himself up to the works of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> especially preaching and catechizing.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1678 Harlay de Champvallon, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, entrusted F&eacute;nelon with the direction of the house of "Nouvelles-Catholiques", a community founded in 1634 by Archbishop Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois de Gondi for <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> young <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> about to enter the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or converts who needed to be strengthened in the <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. It was a new and delicate form of apostolate which thus offered itself to F&eacute;nelon's <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and required all the resources of his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, persuasive eloquence, and magnetic <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>. Within late years his conduct has been severely criticized, and he has been even called intolerant but these charges are without serious foundation and have not been accepted even by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> authors of the "Encyclop&eacute;die des Sciences Religieuses"; their verdict on F&eacute;nelon is "that in <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> to him it must be said that in making converts he ever employed persuasion rather than severity".</p>

<p>When <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> revoked the Edict of Nantes, by which <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> had granted freedom of public worship to the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, missionaries were chosen from among the greatest orators of the day, e.g. <a href="02717a.htm">Bourdaloue</a>, <a href="06100a.htm">Fl&eacute;chier</a>, and others, and were sent to those parts of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> where <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> were most numerous, to labour for their conversion. At the suggestion of his friend <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, F&eacute;nelon was sent with five companions to Santonge, where he manifested great <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, though his methods were always tempered by gentleness. According to Cardinal de Bausset, he induced <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> to remove all troops and all evidences of compulsion from the places he visited, and it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that he proposed and insisted on many methods of which the king did not approve. "When hearts are to be moved", he wrote to Seignelay, "force avails not. Conviction is the only real conversion". Instead of force he employed patience, established classes, and distributed New Testaments and catechisms in the vernacular. Above all, he laid especial emphasis on preaching provided the sermons were by gentle preachers who have a faculty not only for instructing but for winning the confidence of their hearers". It is doubtless <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, as recently published documents prove, that he did not altogether repudiate measures of force, but he only allowed them as a last resource. Even then his severity was confined to exiling from their villages a few recalcitrants and to constraining others under the small penalty of five sous to attend the religious instructions in the churches. Nor did he think that preachers ought to advocate openly even these measures; similarly he was unwilling to have known the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authorship of pamphlets against <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> which he proposed to have printed in <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>. This was certainly an excess of cleverness; but it proves at least that F&eacute;nelon was not in sympathy with that vague tolerance founded on scepticism which the eighteenth century <a href="12652a.htm">rationalists</a> charged him with. In such matters he shared the opinions of all the other great <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of his day. With <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> he held that "to be <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to do good is always an advantage and that <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, when forced to apply their minds to the consideration of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, eventually lay aside their <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, whereas they would never have examined these matters had not authority constrained them."</p>

<p>Before and after his mission at Saintonge, which lasted but a few months (1686-1687), F&eacute;nelon formed many dear friendships. <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> was already his friend, the great <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was at the summit of his fame, and was everywhere looked up to as the <a href="11264c.htm">oracle</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. F&eacute;nelon showed him the utmost deference, visited him at his country-house at <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and assisted at his spiritual conferences and his lectures on the Scriptures at <a href="15366a.htm">Versailles</a>. It was under his inspiration, perhaps even at his request, that F&eacute;nelon wrote about this time his "R&eacute;futation du syst&egrave;me de Malebranche sur la nature et sur la gr&acirc;ce". In this he attacks with great valour and at length the theories of the famous Oratorian on optimism, the Creation, and the <a href="07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>. This treatise, though annoted by Bousset, F&eacute;nelon considered it unwise to publish; it saw the light only in 1820. First among the friends of F&eacute;nelon at this period were the Duc de Bauvilliers and the Duc de Chevreuse, two influential courtiers, eminent for their <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, who had married two daughters of <a href="04096a.htm">Colbert</a>, minister of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. One of these, the Duchesse de Beauvilliers, mother of eight daughters, asked F&eacute;nelon for advice concerning their <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. His reply was the "Trait&eacute; de l'education des filles", in which he insists on <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> beginning at an early age and on the instruction of girls in all the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of their future condition of life. The religious teaching he recommends is one solid enough to enable them to refute <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. He also advises a more serious course of studies than was then customary. Girls ought to be learned without pedantry; the form of instruction should be concrete, sensible, agreeable, and prudent, in a manner to aid their natural abilities. In many ways his pedagogy was ahead of his time, and we may yet learn much from him.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The Duc de Beauvilliers, who had been the first to test in his own <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> the value of the "Trait&eacute; de l'education des filles", was in 1689 named governor of the grandchildren of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. He hastened to secure F&eacute;nelon as tutor to the eldest of these princes, the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. It was a most important post, seeing that the formation of the future King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> lay in his hands; but it was not without great difficulties, owing to the violent, haughty, and character of the pupil. F&eacute;nelon brought to his task a whole-hearted <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and devotion. Everything down to, the Latin themes and versions, was made to serve in the taming of this impetuous spirit. F&eacute;nelon prepared them the better to his plans. With the same object in view, he wrote his "Fables" and his "Dialogues des Morts", but especially his "T&eacute;l&eacute;maque", in which work, under the guise of pleasant fiction, he taught the young prince lessons of self-control, and all the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> required by his exalted position. The results of this training were wonderful. The historian Saint-Simon, as a rule hostile to F&eacute;nelon, says: "De cet ab&icirc;me sortit un prince, affable, doux, mod&eacute;r&eacute;, humain, patient, humble, tout appliqu&eacute; &agrave; ses devoirs." It has been asked in our day if F&eacute;nelon did not succeed too well. When the prince grew to man's estate, his <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> seemed often too refined; he was continually examining himself, reasoning for and against, till he was unable to reach a definite decision, his will being paralysed by fear of doing the wrong thing. However, these defects of character, against which F&eacute;nelon in his letters was the first to protest, did not show themselves in youth. About 1695 every one who came in contact with the prince was in admiration at the change in him.</p>

<p>To reward the tutor, <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> gave him, in 1694, the Abbey of Saint-Val&eacute;ry, with its annual revenue of fourteen thousand livres. The Acad&eacute;mie had opened its doors to him and <a href="09548b.htm">Madame de Maintenon</a>, the morganatic wife of the king, began to consult him on matters of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and on the regulation of the house of Saint-Cyr, which she had just established for the training of young girls. Soon afterwards the <a href="03209c.htm">archiepiscopal See of Cambrai</a>, one of the best in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, fell vacant, and the king offered it to F&eacute;nelon, at the same time expressing a wish that he would continue to instruct the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Nominated in February, 1696, F&eacute;nelon was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in August of the same year by <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Saint-Cyr. The future of the young <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> looked brilliant, when he fell into deep disgrace.</p>

<p>The cause of F&eacute;nelon's trouble was his connection with <a href="07092b.htm">Madame Guyon</a>, whom he had met in the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of his friends, the Beauvilliers and the Chevreuses. She was a native of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, which she left when about twenty-eight years old, a <a href="15617c.htm">widowed</a> mother of three children, to carry on a sort of apostolate of <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, under the direction of P&egrave;re Lacombe, a <a href="02302a.htm">Barnabite</a>. After many journeys to Geneva, and through Provence and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, she set forth her <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> in two works, "Le moyen court et facile de faire oraison" and "Les torrents spirituels". In exaggerated language characteristic of her visionary mind, she presented a system too evidently founded on the <a href="12608c.htm">Quietism</a> of Molinos, that had just been condemned by <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in 1687. There were, however, great divergencies between the two systems. Whereas Molinos made man's earthly perfection consist in a state of uninterrupted contemplation and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, which would dispense the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> from all active virtue and reduce it to absolute inaction, <a href="07092b.htm">Madame Guyon</a> rejected with horror the dangerous conclusions of Molinos as to the cessation of the necessity of offering positive resistance to temptation. Indeed, in all her relations with P&egrave;re Lacombe, as well as with F&eacute;nelon, her virtuous life was never called in <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Soon after her arrival in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> she became acquainted with many <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of the court and in the city, among them <a href="09548b.htm">Madame de Maintenon</a> and the Ducs de Beauvilliers and Chevreuse, who introduced her to F&eacute;nelon. In turn, he was attracted by her <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, her lofty spirituality, the charm of her <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>, and of her books. It was not long, however, before the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, in whose diocese Saint-Cyr was, began to unsettle the mind of <a href="09548b.htm">Madame de Maintenon</a> by questioning the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of <a href="07092b.htm">Madame Guyon's</a> theories. The latter, thereupon, begged to have her works submitted to an ecclesiastical commission composed of <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, <a href="11085b.htm">de Noailles</a>, who was then <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, later <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and M. Tronson; superior of-Saint-Sulpice. After an examination which lasted six months, the commission delivered its verdict in thirty-four articles known as the "Articles d' Issy", from the place near <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> where the commission sat. These articles, which were signed by F&eacute;nelon and the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, also by the members of the commission, condemned very briefly <a href="07092b.htm">Madame Guyon's</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and gave a short exposition of the <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> on <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <a href="07092b.htm">Madame Guyon</a> submitted to the condemnation, but her teaching spread in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, who have had her books reprinted have always expressed sympathy with her views. Cowper translated some of her <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> into English verse; and her autobiography was translated into English by Thomas Digby (London, 1805) and Thomas Upam (New York, 1848). Her books have been long forgotten in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<p>In accordance with the decisions taken at Issy, <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> now wrote his instruction on the "Etats d' oraison", as an explanation of the thirty-four articles. F&eacute;nelon refused to sign it, on the plea that his <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> forbade him to condemn a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> who had already been condemned. To explain his own views of the "Articles d'Issy", he hastened to publish the "Explication des Maximes des Saints", a rather arid treatise in forty-five articles. Each article was divided into two paragraphs, one laying down the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, the other the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>, teaching concerning the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. In this work he undertakes to distinguish clearly every step in the upward way of the spiritual life. The final end of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is pure <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, without any admixture of self-interest, a <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> in which neither fear of punishment nor desire of reward has any part. The means to this end, F&eacute;nelon points out, are those long since indicated by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mystics, i.e. holy indifference, detachment, self-abandonment, passiveness, through all of which states the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is led by contemplation. F&eacute;nelon's book was scarcely published when it aroused much opposition. The king, in particular, was angry. He distrusted all religious novelties, and he reproached <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> with not having warned him of the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of his grandsons' tutor. He appointed the Bishops of Meaux, Chartes, and <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> to examine F&eacute;nelon's work and select passages for condemnation, but F&eacute;nelon himself submitted the book to the judgement of <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (27 April, 1697). A vigorous conflict broke out at once, particularly between <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and F&eacute;nelon. Attack and reply followed too fast for analysis here. The works of F&eacute;nelon on the subject fill six volumes, not to speak of the 646 letters relating to <a href="12608c.htm">Quietism</a>, the writer proving himself a skillful polemical writer, deeply versed in spiritual things, endowed with quick intelligence and a <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> suppleness not always to be clearly distinguished from quibbling and a straining of the sense. After a long and detailed examination by the consultors and <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the Holy Office, lasting over two years and occupying 132 sessions, "Les Maxims des Saints" was finally condemned (12 March, 1699) as containing propositions which, in the obvious meaning of the words, or else because of the sequence of the thoughts, were "temerarious, <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a>, ill-sounding, offensive to <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> ears, pernicious in practice, and <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> in fact". Twenty-three propositions were selected as having incurred this censure, but the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by no means intended to imply that he approved the rest of the book. F&eacute;nelon submitted at once. "We adhere to this brief", he wrote in a pastoral letter in which he made known Rome's decision to the flock, "and we accept it not only for the twenty three propositions but for the whole book, simply, absolutely, and without a shadow of reservation." Most of his contemporaries found his submission adequate, edifying and admirable. In recent times, however, scattered letters have enabled a few critics to <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> its sincerity. In our opinion a few words written impulsively, and contradicted by the whole tenor of the writers's life, cannot justify so grave a charge. It must be remembered, too, that at the meeting of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> held to receive the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of condemnation, F&eacute;nelon declared that he laid aside his own opinion and accepted the judgement of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that if this act of submission seemed lacking in any way, he was ready to do whatever <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> would suggest. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> never required anything more than the above-mentioned spontaneous act.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, who had done all he could to bring the condemnation of the "Maximes des Saints", had already punished its author by ordering him to remain within the limits of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Vexed later at the publication of "T&eacute;l&eacute;maque", in which he saw his <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> and his government subjected to criticism, the king could never be prevailed upon to revoke this command. F&eacute;nelon submitted without complaint or regret, and gave himself up entirely to the care of his flock. With a revenue of two hundred thousand livres and eight hundred <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, some of which were on Spanish territory, <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, which had been regained by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> only in 1678, was one of the most important sees in the kingdom. F&eacute;nelon gave up several months of each year to a visitation of his archdiocese, which was not even interrupted by the War of the Spanish Succession, when opposing armies were camped in various parts of his territory. The captains of these armies, full of veneration for his F&eacute;nelon, left him free to come and go as he would. The remainder of the year he spent in his episcopal palace at <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, where with his relatives and his friends, the Abb&eacute;ss de Langeron, de Chanterac, and de Beaumont, he led an uneventful life, monastic in its regularity. Every year he gave a <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> course in one or other important <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and on the principal feasts he preached in his own <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His sermons were short and simple composed after a brief meditation, and never committed to writing; with the exception of some few preached on more important occasions, they have not been preserved. His dealings with his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were always marked by condescension and cordiality. "His priests", says Saint-Simon, "to whom he made himself both father and brother, bore him in their hearts." He took a deep interest in their <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> training, assisted at the examination of those who were to be <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and gave them conferences during their retreat. He presided over the concursus for <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> and made inquiries among the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> concerning the qualifications of each candidate.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon was always approachable, and on his walks often conversed with those he chanced to meet. He <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> to visit the peasants in their houses, interested himself in their joys and sorrows, and, to avoid paining them, accepted the simple gifts of their hospitality. During the War of the Spanish Succession the doors of his palace were open to all the poor who took refuge in <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. The rooms and stairways were filled with them, and his gardens and <a href="15387a.htm">vestibules</a> sheltered their live stock. He is yet remembered in the vicinity of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> and the peasants still give their children the name F&eacute;nelon, as that of a saint.</p>

<p>Engrossed as F&eacute;nelon was with the administration of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he never lost sight of the general interests of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This became evident when <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, quiescent for nearly thirty years, again raised its head on the occasion of the famous <em>Cas de Conscience</em>, by which an anonymous writer endeavoured to put new life into the old distinction between the "question of law" and "question of fact" (<em>question de droit et question de fait</em>), acknowledging that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> could legally condemn the famous five propositions attributed to <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, but denying that she could <a href="11189a.htm">oblige</a> any one to believe that they were really to be found in the "Augustinus" of that writer. F&eacute;nelon multiplied publications of every kind against the reviving <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>; he wrote letters, pastoral instruction, memoirs, in French and in Latin, which fill seven volumes of his works. He set himself to combat the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <em>Cas de Conscience</em>, to refute the theory known as "respectful silence", and to enlighten <a href="04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> on public opinion in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> P&egrave;re <a href="12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> brought fresh fuel to the strife by his "Reflexions morales sur le Nouveau Testament", which was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> condemned by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> (1713). F&eacute;nelon defended this famous pontifical constitution in a series of dialogues intended to influence men of the world. Great as was his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> against <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, he was always gentle with the <a href="05525a.htm">erring</a> so that Saint-Simon could say "The Low Countries swarmed with <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, and his <a href="03209c.htm">Diocese of Cambrai</a>, in particular, was full of them. In both places they found an ever-peaceful refuge, and were glad and content to here peaceably under one who was their enemy with his pen. They had no fears of their <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, who, though opposed to their <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, did not disturb their tranquillity."</p>

<p>In spite of the multiplicity of his labours, F&eacute;nelon found time to carry on an absorbing correspondence with his relatives, friends, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and in fact every one who sought his advice. It is in this mass of correspondence, ten volumes of which have reached us, that we may see F&eacute;nelon as a director of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. People of every sphere of life, men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> of the work, religious, soldiers, courtiers, servants, are here met with, among them Mesdames <a href="09548b.htm">de Maintenon</a>, de Gramont, de la Maisonfort, de Montebron, <a href="11085b.htm">de Noailles</a>, members of the <a href="04096a.htm">Colbert family</a>, the Marquis de Seignelay, the Duc de Chaulnes, above all the Ducs de Chevreuse and de Beauvilliers, not forgetting the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. F&eacute;nelon shows how well he possessed all the qualities he required from directors, patience, <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the human heart and the spiritual life, equanimity of disposition, firmness, and straightforwardness, "together with a quiet gaiety altogether removed from any stern or affected austerity". In return he required docility of mind and entire submission of will. He aimed at leading <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> to the pure <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, as far as such a thing is humanly possible, for though the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the "Maximes des Saints" do not reappear in the letters of direction, it is still the same F&eacute;nelon, with the same tendencies, the same aiming at self-abandonment and detachment from all personal interests, all kept, however, within due limits; for as he says "this <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> does not require all <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> to practice austerities like those of the ancient solitaries, but merely that they be sober, just, and moderate in the use of all things expedient"; nor does <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, "like temporal affairs, exact a long and continuous application"; "the practice of devotion is in no way incompatible with the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of one's state in life". The desire to teach his disciples the secret of harmonizing the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of religion with those of everyday life suggests to F&eacute;nelon all sorts of advice, sometimes most unexpected from the pen of a director, especially when he happens to be dealing with his friends at court. This has given occasion to some of his critics to accuse him of <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a>, and of being as anxious to control the state as to guide <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p>It is especially in the writings intended for the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> that his political <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> are apparent. Besides a great number of letters, he sent him through his friends, the Ducs de Beauvilliers and de Chevreuse, an "Examen de conscience sur les devoirs de la Royaut&eacute;", nine memoirs on the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of the Spanish Succession, and "Plans de Gouvernement, concretes avec le Duc de Chevreuse". If we add to this the "T&eacute;l&eacute;maque", the "Lettre &agrave; Louis XIV", the "Essai sur le Gouvernement civil", and the "M&eacute;moires sur les precautions &agrave; prendre apr&egrave;s la mort du Duc de Bourgogne", we have a complete exposition of F&eacute;nelon's political <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. We shall indicate only the points in which they are original for the period when they were written. F&eacute;nelon's ideal government was a monarchy limited by an aristocracy. The king was not to have absolute power; he was to obey the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> which he was to draw up with the co-operation of the nobility; extraordinary subsidies were to be levied only with the consent of the people. At other times he was to be assisted by the States-General, which was to meet every three years, and by provincial assemblies, all to be advisory bodies to the king rather than representative assemblies. The state was to have charge of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>; it was to control public manners by sumptuary legislation and to forbid both sexes unsuitable marriages (<em>m&eacute;salliances</em>). The temporal arm and the spiritual arm were to be independent of each other, but to afford mutual support. His ideal state is outlined with much wisdom in his political writings are to be found many observations remarkably judicious but also not a little Utopianism.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon also took much interest in literature and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. <a href="04602a.htm">Monsieur Dacier</a>, perpetual secretary to the Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise, having requested him, in the name of that body, to furnish him with his views on the works it ought to undertake when the "Dictionnaire" was finished, F&eacute;nelon replied in his "Lettre sur les occupations de l'Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise", a work still much admired in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. This letter, which treats of the French tongue, of rhetoric, poetry, history, and ancient and modern writers, exhibits a well-balanced mind acquainted with all the masterpieces of antiquity, alive to the charm of simplicity, attached to classical traditions yet discreetly open to new <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> (especially in history), also, however, to some chimerical theories, at least concerning things poetical. At this very time the Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, the future regent was consulting him on quite different subjects. This prince, a sceptic through circumstances rather than by any force of reasoning, profited by the appearance of F&eacute;nelon's "Trait&eacute; de l'existence de Dieu" to ask its author some questions on the worship due to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>. F&eacute;nelon replied in a series of letters, only the first three of which are answers to the difficulties proposed by the prince. Together they form a continuation of the "Trait&eacute; de l'existence de Dieu", the first part of which had been published in 1712 without F&eacute;nelon's <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The second part appeared only in 1718, after its author's death. Though an almost forgotten work of his youth, it was received with much approval, and was soon translated into English and German. It is from his letters and this treatise that we learn something about the philosophy of F&eacute;nelon. It borrows from both <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a>. For F&eacute;nelon the strongest arguments for the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a> were those based on final causes and on the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>, both developed along broad lines and with much literary charm, rather than with precision or originality.</p>

<p>F&eacute;nelon's last years were saddened by the death of his best friends. Towards the end of 1710 he lost Abb&eacute; de Langeron, his lifelong companion; in February, 1712, his pupil, the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, died. A few months later the Duc de Chevreuse was taken away, and the Duc de Beauvilliers followed in August, 1714. F&eacute;nelon survived him only a few months, making a last request to <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> to appoint a successor firm against <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, and to favour the introduction of <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> into his <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. With him disappeared one of the most illustrious members of the French episcopate, certainly one of the most attractive men of his age. He owed his success solely to his great talents and admirable virtues. The renown he enjoyed during life increased after his death. Unfortunately, however, his fame among <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> was largely due to his opposition to <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, and among the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to the fact that he opposed and was punished by <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. F&eacute;nelon is therefore for them a precursor of their own tolerant scepticism and their infidel philosophy, a forerunner of Rousseau, beside whom they placed him on the <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the Pantheon. In our days a reaction has set in, due to the cult of <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and the publication of F&eacute;nelon's correspondence, which has brought into bolder relief the contrasts of his character, showing him at once an ancient and a modern, <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> and profane, a mystic and a statesman, democrat and aristocrat, gentle and obstinate, frank and subtle. He would perhaps have seemed more human in our eyes were he a lesser man; nevertheless he remains one of the most attractive, brilliant, and puzzling figures that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has ever produced.</p>

<p>The most convenient and best edition of F&eacute;nelon's works is that begun by Lebel at <a href="15366a.htm">Versailles</a> in 1820 and completed at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> by Leclere in 1830. It comprises twenty-two volumes, besides eleven volumes of letters, in all thirty-three volumes, not including an index volume. The various works are grouped under five five headings: (I) Theological and controversial works (Vols. I-XVI), of which the principal are: "Trait&eacute; de l'existence et des attributs de Dieu", letters on various metaphysical and religious subjects; "Trait&eacute; du minist&egrave;re des pasteurs"; "De Summi Pontificis auctoritate", "R&eacute;futation du syst&egrave;me du P. Malebranche sur la nature et la gr&acirc;ce"; "Lettre &agrave; l'Ev&ecirc;que d'Arras sur la lecture de l'Ecriture Sainte en langue vulgaire", works on <a href="12608c.htm">Quietism</a> and <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. (2) Works on moral and spiritual subjects (Vols. XVII and XVIII): "Trait&eacute; de l'&eacute;ducation des filles"; sermons and works on <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. (3) Twenty-four pastoral charges (XVIII). (4) Literary works (Vols. XIX-XXII): "Dialogues des Morts"; "T&eacute;l&eacute;maque"; "Dialogues sur l'&eacute;loquence". (5) Political writings (Vol. XXII): "Examen de conscience sur les devoirs de la Royaut&eacute;"; various memoirs on the War of the Spanish Succession; "Plans du Gouvernement concertes avec le Duc de Chevreuse". The correspondence includes letters to friends at court, as Beauvilliers, Chevreuse, and the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>; letters of direction, and letters on <a href="12608c.htm">Quietism</a>. To these must be added the "Explication des maximes des Saints sur la vie lnterieure" (Paris, 1697).</p>
