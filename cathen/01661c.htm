<p>A former city of the Roman Empire, situated at the head of the Adriatic, on what is now the Austrian sea-coast, in the country of Goerz, at the confluence of the Anse and the Torre. It was for many centuries the seat of a famous Western <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, and as such plays and important part in <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, particularly in that of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>

<p>The site is now known as Aglar, a village of 1500 inhabitants. The city arose (180 B.C.) on the narrow strip between the mountains and the lagoons, during the Illyrian <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, as a means of checking the advance of that warlike people. Its commerce grew rapidly, and when <a href="02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> made it (168) the principal fortress of the empire against the barbarians of the North and East, it rose to the acme of its greatness and soon had a population of 100,000. It was pillaged in 238 by the <a href="10077b.htm">Emperor Maximinus</a>, and it was so utterly destroyed in 452 by <a href="02061b.htm">Attila</a>, that it was afterwards hard to recognize its original site. The Roman inhabitants, together with those of smaller towns in the neighbourhood, fled to the lagoons, and so laid the foundations of the city of <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Aquileia arose again, but much diminished, and was once more destroyed (590) by the Lombards; after which it came under the Dukes of Friuli, was again a city of the Empire under <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and in the eleventh century became a <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> possesion of its patriarch, whose temporal authority, however, was constantly disputed and assailed by the territorial nobility.</p>

<h2>Ecclesiastical history</h2>

<p>Ancient tradition asserts that the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was founded by <a href="09672c.htm">St. Mark</a>, sent thither by St. Peter, previous to his mission to Alexandria. St. Hermagoras is said to have been its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and to have died a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death (c. 70). At the end of the third century (285) another <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>, St. Helarus (or Hilarius) was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Aquileia. In the course of the fourth century the city was the chief <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> centre for the region about the head of the Adriatic, afterwards known as Venetia and Istria. In 381, St. Valerian appears as <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the churches in this territory; his synod of that year, held against the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>, was attended by 32 (or 24) <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In time part of Western <a href="07663a.htm">Illyria</a>, and to the north, Noricum and Rhaetia, came under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Aquileia. Roman cities like <a href="15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a>, Pola, Belluno, Feltre, <a href="15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, <a href="15038a.htm">Treviso</a>, <a href="11385b.htm">Padua</a>, were among its suffragans in the fifth and sixth centuries. As <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of such an extensive territory, and representatives of Roman civilization among the <a href="11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> and Lombards, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Aquileia sought and obtained from their barbarian masters the honorific title of patriarch, personal, however, as yet to each titular of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. This title aided to promote and at the same time to justify the strong tendency towards independence that was quite manifest in its relations with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a trait which it shared with its less fortunate rival, <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, that never obtained the patriarchial dignity. It was only after a long conflict that the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> recognized the title thus assumed by the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Aquileia. Owing to the acquiescence of <a href="15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> in the condemnation of the <a href="14707b.htm">"Three Chapters"</a>, in the Fifth General Council at Constantinople (553) the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> (Liguria and Aemilia) and among among them those of the Venetia and Istria, broke off communion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, under the leadership of Macedonius of Aquileia (535-556). In the next decade the Lombards overran all Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the patriarch of Aquileia was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to fly, with the treasures of his church, to the little island of Grado, near Trieste, a last remnant of the imperial possessions in Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. This political change did not affect the relations of the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> with the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>; its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whether in Lombard or imperial territory, stubbornly refused all invitations to a reconciliation. Various efforts of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the exarchs at <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, both peaceful and otherwise, met with persistent refusal to renew the bonds of unity until the election of Candidian (606 or 607) as <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Aquileia (in Grado). Weary of fifty years' <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, those of his suffragans whose sees lay within the empire joined him in submission to the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>; his suffragans among the Lombards persisted in their <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. They went further, and established in Aquileia itself a <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of their own, so that henceforth there were two little <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> in Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Aquileia in Grado and Old-Aquileia. Gradually the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> lost its vigour, and by 700 it was entirely spent; in the <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> held that year at Old-Aquileia it was formally closed. It was probably during the seventh century that the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> recognized in the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Grado the title of <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Aquileia, in order to offset its assumption by the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Old-Aquileia. In succeeding centuries in continued in use by both, but had no longer any practical significance. The Patriarchs of Old-Aquileia lived henceforth, first at Cormons, and from the eighth to the thirteenth century at Friuli (<em>Forum Julii</em>). In the later part of the eighth century the creation of a new <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="10244c.htm">see</a> at <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> added to the humiliation of Old-Aquileia, which claimed as its own the territory of Carinthia, but was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to acquiesce in the arbitration of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, by which Ursus of Aquileia (d. 811) was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to relinquish to Arno of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> the Carinthian territory north of the Drave. German <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> influence was henceforth more and more tangible in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of Old-Aquileia. In 1011 one of its <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, John IV, surrounded by thirty <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the new Cathedral of <a href="02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. Its influential patriarch, Poppo, or Wolfgang (1019-42) <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his own <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Aquileia, 13 July 1031, in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>. in 1047, the Patriarch Eberhard, a German, assisted at the Roman synod of that year, in which it was declared that Aquileia was inferior in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> only to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Nevertheless, Aquileia lost gradually to other <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> several of its suffragans, and when the Patriarchate of Grado was at last transferred (1451) from that insignificant place to proud and powerful <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, the prestige of Old-Aquileia could not but suffer notably. In the meantime, during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Patriarchs of Aquileia had greatly favoured as a residence <a href="15118a.htm">Udine</a>, an imperial donation, in <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> territory. In 1348 Aquileia was destroyed by an earthquake, and its <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were henceforth, to all intents and purposes, Metropolitans of <a href="15118a.htm">Udine</a>. Since the transfer of the patriarchical residence to <a href="15118a.htm">Udine</a> the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> had never lived in peace with the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, of whose imperial favour and tendencies they were jealous. When the patriarch Louis of Teck (1412-39) compromised himself in a <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, the latter seized on all the lands donated to the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> by the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The loss of his ancient temporal estate was acquiesced in a little later (1445) by the succeeding patriarch, in return for an annual salary of 5,000 ducats allowed him from the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> treasury. Henceforth only <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> were allowed to hold the Patriarchate of Aquileia. Under the famous Domenigo Grimani (<a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> since 1497) Austrian Friuli was added to the territory of the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> whose <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> thus extended over some Austrian <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Extinction of the patriarchate</h2>

<p>The 109th and last <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Aquileia was Daniel Dolfin (Delfino), coadjutor since 1714 of his predecessor, Dionigio Dolfin, his successor since 1734, and <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> since 1747. The <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> claim to the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Aquileia had been met by a counter-claim on the part of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> since the end of the fifteenth century when, as mentioned above, Austrian <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> came to be included within the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. Finally, <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> was chosen as arbiter. He awarded (1748-49) to the Patriarchate of <a href="15118a.htm">Udine</a> the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> territory in Friuli, and for the Austrian possessions he created a vicariate apostolic with residence at Goerz independent of the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Aquileia, and immediately dependent on the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in whose name all <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was exercised. This decision was not satisfactory to <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and in 1751 the Pope divided the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> into two <a href="01694b.htm">archdioceses</a>; one at <a href="15118a.htm">Udine</a>, with <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Friuli for its territory, the other at Goerz, with <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Austrian Friuli. Of the ancient <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, once so proud and influential, there remained but the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church of <a href="01661c.htm">Acquileia</a>. It was made <a href="05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and to its <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> was granted the right of using episcopal insignia seven times in the year.</p>
