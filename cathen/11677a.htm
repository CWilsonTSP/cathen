<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> periodical press of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> is a product of the nineteenth century. It is only within the last forty years that it has become important by its circulation and its ability. A number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journals are, however, much older. The oldest, the "Augsburg Postzeitung", was founded in 1695, and five others were established in the eighteenth century. Of those which were founded in the early part of the nineteenth century the most important is the "Westf&auml;lischer Merkur", established at M&uuml;nster in 1822, which at first, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, had a Liberal tendency. Until 1848 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism did not prosper. In this reactionary period the severe censorship of the government authorities was a drawback to the Press in general; <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journals were viewed in an even less friendly spirit than the others. In <a href="15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> and <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a> no <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journals were allowed to be published. Up to the second and third decades of the nineteenth century, on the other hand, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> themselves seemed to be in a condition of <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> torpor. For the most part, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were under the influence of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and the prevailing philosophy of the times. Cultured <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> no less than the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, was under the influence of the "all-embracing religion of humanity", which diluted <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The "Theologische Zeitschrift" of <a href="02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, edited by J. J. Batz and Father Brenner, may be regarded as the oldest periodical, but its existence lasted only from 1809 to 1814. It was followed by the "Katholische Literaturzeitung", first edited by Father K. Felder, then by Kaspar Anton von Mastiaux, who was succeeded by Friedrich von Kerz and Anton von Besnard (1810-36). The oldest of the periodicals still in existence is the "T&uuml;binger Theologische Quartalschrift", founded in 1819, which has always had a high reputation on account of its genuinely scholarly spirit. Among its editors have been Hirscher, M&ouml;hler, <a href="08703a.htm">Kuhn</a>, Hefele, <a href="15587a.htm">Welte</a>, Linsemaun, Funke, and Schanz, names of the highest repute in the history of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In 1821 the "Katholik" was founded by Andreas R&auml;ss and <a href="15577a.htm">Nikolaus Weis</a>, afterwards Bishops of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Speyer respectively. The purpose was stated to be "to offer the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> opposition to the attacks, partly open, partly concealed, against the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, by <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> articles on the doctrines of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, <a href="07365a.htm">Church history</a> and liturgy, the training of children, devotional exercises by the people, and all that belongs to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>". The chief collaborator in 1824-26 was the great publicist Joseph von G&ouml;rres, but the responsible editors were G. Scheiblein and Fr. L. Br. Liebermann. In 1827, <a href="15577a.htm">Weis</a> again became the chief editor. He was followed by <a href="04786c.htm">Franz Xaver Dieringer</a> (1841-43); Franz Sausen (1844-49); Johann <a href="02278a.htm">Baptist</a> Heinrich and <a href="10603a.htm">Christoph Moufang</a> (1850-90); <a href="12634a.htm">Michael Raich</a> (1891-1906); Joseph Becker and Joseph Selbst (from 1907). Since the appearance of the new <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> the "Katholik" has been its exponent.</p>

<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement was greatly aided by the arrest in 1837 of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Cologne and Posen-Gnesen, <a href="05161b.htm">von Droste-Vischering</a> and <a href="05192c.htm">von Dunin</a>. Connected with this is the founding of the "Historisch-politische Bl&auml;tter", by Georg Phillips and Guido G&ouml;rres in 1838. This periodical contended against <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> theories of the state, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, and the writing of history from a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> point of view. Distinguished publicists such as Joseph G&ouml;rres, father of Guido, and the converted jurist Karl Ernst Jarek collaborated on the journal and gained for it a lasting influence. Up to 1871 it Was the most prominent journalistic organ of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Its position in politics was that of Greater <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. After the death of G&ouml;rres (1852) the chief editor was Edmund J&ouml;rg; the assistant editor from 1858 up to J&ouml;rg's death in 1901 was Franz Binder. From 1903 Binder and Georg Jochner have shared the editorial responsibility. Other periodicals were only short-lived, as the <a href="07276c.htm">Hermesian</a> "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Philosophie und katholische Theologie" that existed from 1833 to 1852; the "Jahrb&uuml;cher f&uuml;r Theologie und christliche Philosophie" (1834-47), edited by the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of Giessen; the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Theologie", edited at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in 1839-49; the "Archiv f&uuml;r theologische Literatur", edited by <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, Haneberg, etc., from 1842 to 1843; the "Katholische Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Wissenschaft und Kunst", edited by <a href="04786c.htm">Dieringer</a> 1844-46, and the continuation of this periodical, the "Katholische Vierteljahrsschrift f&uuml;r Wissenschaft und Kunst", 1847-49. In addition there were various church weeklies.</p>

<p>The year 1848 and the political and religious emancipations which it brought were of much importance for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press. The freedom of the Press enabled the journals to express public opinion. From this time on each important periodical became the advocate of some definite political <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>. Moreover, another result of 1848 was freedom of association, of which the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at once made use to the largest possible extent. An increase in the circulation of the journals already existing and the founding of new ones was very materially aided by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>. A rich <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life arose and came into public notice with unexpected power. Thus in the years directly succeeding 1848 a large number of new periodicals appeared. Among them were, to mention only the more important, the "Echo der Gegenwart" of <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a>; the "Rheinische Volkshalle" of Cologne, which, from 2 Oct., 1849, took the name of "Deutsche Volkshalle"; the "Mainzer Journal", edited by Franz Sausen: the "Deutsches Volksblatt" of Stuttgart; the "Niederrheinische Vplkszeitung" of Krefeld; in 1849 the "Westf&auml;lisches Volksblatt" of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>; in 1852 the "M&uuml;nsterische Anzeiger"; in 1853 the "Rheinischen Volksbl&auml;tter" of Cologne; in 1854 the "Neue Augsburger Zeitung"; in 1856 the "Bayrischer Kurier" of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>. In addition the conference of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> held at <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (November, 1848) expressed the wish that there should be founded in all <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> Sunday papers containing edifying and instructive matter. Of such journals the one that attained the most importance was the "Frankfurter katholisches Kirchenblatt". The most important journals during the fifth decade of the nineteenth century were the "Deutsche Volkshalle" of Cologne, the "Mainzer Journal" and the "Deutsches Volksblatt". The "Deutsche Volkshalle" was suppressed 10 July, 1855, because its attitude towards the Government had not been friendly. Its place was taken by a journal planned on a large scale, the "Deutschland" of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, founded in 1855 by the city <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and well-known writer, Beda Weber. After two years it ceased, not from lack of vitality, but on account of bad financial management. The "K&ouml;lnische Bl&auml;tter", issued from 1 April, 1860, by J. P. Bachem of Cologne, had a more fortunate fate. From 1 Jan., 1869, this well-edited paper bore the name of "K&ouml;lnische Volkszeitung". Further, during the sixties appeared the "Freiburger Bote" (1865); the "Fr&auml;nkische Volksblatt" of <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> (1867); the "Essener Volkszeitung" (1868); the "Osanbr&uuml;cker Volkszeitung" (1868); and the"Schlesische Volkszeitung" (1869).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1862 the "Literarischer Handweiser" was founded at M&uuml;nster by Franz H&uuml;lskamp and Hermann Rump, to give information concerning the latest literary publications. From 1876, after Rump's death, H&uuml;lskamp edited it alone; from 1904 it has been edited by Edmund Niesert. The "Chilianeum", a general review for "learning, art, and life" was founded at <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> and edited by J. B. Stamminger; the review had excellent collaborators, but lived only from 1862 to 1869. During the sixties there was also established the organ of the German <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach", which originally (from 1865) appeared at irregular intervals as pamphlets on burning questions of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles. It was called into existence by the storm against the Syllabus and the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of 8 Dec., 1864. From 1871 it has been issued regularly and has included within the scope of its observation all important questions and events. Its circle of collaborators includes the most noted German <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, as Alexander Baumgartner (now deceased), Stephan Beissel, Viktor Cathrein, Franz Ehrle, <a href="08700b.htm">Wilhelm Kreiten</a> (now deceased), Angustin Lehmkuhl, Christian and Tilmann Peach, etc. In 1866 the excellent "Theologisches Literaturblatt" of Bonn was founded, but after 1870 it became an organ of the <a href="11235b.htm">Old Catholics</a>.</p>

<p>The <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> now broke out, which consolidated the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and impressed on them most powerfully the necessity of a press of their own. Consequently the larger number of <a href="11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> have appeared from the seventies on. Simultaneous with the occurrence of the <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> was the founding of the <a href="16020b.htm">Centre Party</a> (Dec., 1870). Since then a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper and a paper that is the organ of the <a href="16020b.htm">Centre Party</a> are with very few exceptions identical. The exciting years of the ecclesiastico-political struggle small papers particularly, such as the "Kaplanspresse" (<a href="04570a.htm">curate's</a> press), shot up like mushrooms. On 1 Jan., 1871 the "Germania" newspaper appeared at <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, as the new and most important organ of the <a href="16020b.htm">Centre Party</a>; it was founded as a company by members of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a> with the active and praiseworthy aid of the embassy councillor Friedrich Kehler (died 1901). Up to 1878 <a href="09557b.htm">Paul Majunke</a> (died 1899) wrote for it articles that were exceedingly sharp and contentious in tone. He was followed as editor up to 1881 by the learned and more moderate Dr. Adolf Franz, who was succeeded by Theodor Stahl, Dr. Eduard Marcour, and, from 1894, Hermann ten Brink. Besides the "Germania" and the "K&ouml;lnische Volkszeitung", which latter has been edited from 1876 by Dr. Herman Cardauns with great skill and intelligence, there are important provincial periodicals that maintain <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. Of these should be mentioned: the "Deutsche Reichszeitung" founded at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a> in 1872; the "D&uuml;sseldorfer Volksblatt", that developed greatly under the editorial guidance of Dr. Eduard H&uuml;sgen; the "Niederrheinische Volkszeitung" of Krefeld; the "Essener Volkszeitung"; the "Trierische Landeszeitung", founded in 1873 by the energetic <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> Georg Friedrich Dasbach (died 1907); the "Westf&auml;lischer Merkur" of M&uuml;nster, edited by J. Hoffmann and Chaplain Karl B&ouml;ddinghaus; the "Tremonia" of Dortmund, founded in 1875; the "M&uuml;nsterischer Anzeiger"; the "Westf&auml;lisches Volksblatt" of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>; the Schlesische Volkszeitung" of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> edited by Dr. Arthur Hager, one of the "most dashing champions of the <a href="16020b.htm">Centre Party</a>"; the "Deutsches Volksblatt" of Stuttgart; the "Mainzer Journal"; the "Badischer Beobachter"; the "Augsburger Postzeitung"; the "Bayerischer Kurier" of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>. The editors had to make great personal <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, for the legal actions against them for violations of the press <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> the confiscations, fines, and imprisonments were almost endless. It must be acknowledged that there were some editorial elements whose speech and method of fighting did no <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> to their cause. Among the weekly papers the "Katholisches Volksblatt" of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> had a large circulation (35,000), and great influence in Southern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; the "Schwarzes Blatt" was published at <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a> as a paper of general scope for the common people.</p>

<p>It was in the era of the <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> (1875) that the first large illustrated <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> periodical "Der Deutsche Hausschatz" was founded at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>; it had a large circulation and was edited 1875-88 by Venanz M&uuml;ller; 1888-98 by Heinrich Keiter; at present by Dr. Otto Denk. A new literary journal was also established in 1875 by the <a href="13675a.htm">secular priest</a> J. K&ouml;hler under the name of the "Literarische Rundschau f&uuml;r das katholische Deutschland". From this time on the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press has steadily grown. The number of political newspapers and eeclesiastico-political Sunday papers was: in 1880, 186; in 1890, 272; in 1900; 419; in 1908, 500. In <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> alone the <a href="11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> numbered in 1870, 49; in 1880, 109; in 1890, 149; in 1900, 270. The number of <a href="11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> appearing in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1890 was 143. Since this date the number has more than doubled.</p>

<p>The present condition of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press is as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Daily political newspapers 278; political newspapers appearing four times weekly, 14; three times weekly, 134; twice weekly, 83; once weekly, 64; in addition there are 19, the time of appearance of which is unknown, making altogether 592. In regard to the extent of the circulation of these newspapers, statements as to the issue have been given by the publishers of 338 of them. The total issue of all for one number amounts to 1,938,434. The issue printed by the remaining 254 can be averaged as 1500 for each number, altogether as 381,000. According to this all the political newspapers taken together issue a total edition of 2,319,434 for one number. In 1880 the number of subscribers to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers was estimated at 596,000; in 1890 Keiter estimated it at over 1,000,000. The growth, therefore, was very large. Unfortunately, a comparison with the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Press cannot be made because comprehensive statistics are lacking, and because there is some uncertainty as to just what would be meant by a "Protestant newspaper". Yet it may be accepted that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press would equal it in the number of its organs and subscribers.</p>

<p>An important <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper is the "K&ouml;lnische Volkszeitung", which appears three times daily; the editor-in-chief from 1907 is Dr. Karl Hoeber, the publisher J. P. Bachem of Cologne; circulation 26,500 copies. Its quiet, dignified, conciliatory tone, combined with firmness of principle, has gained for it the respect of all, especially the cultured circles, and its influence extends far beyond the limits of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The "Germania" is next to it in reputation; the editor-in-chief of the "Germania" is Hermann ten Brink, the publisher. Financially it is less favourably situated than the Cologne journal, because being published in a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> city, it lacks advertisements. In 1882 its circulation was 7000 copies; its present circulation is unknown, but it is probably from 12,000 to 14,000. The other newspapers previously mentioned in speaking of the <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> have also prospered and developed, with the possible exception of the "Westf&auml;lischer Merkur", which has declined somewhat. The one with the largest number of subscribers is the "Essener Volkszeitung" (54,500).</p>

<p>(2) There are published in the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a> over 300 <a href="11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a>, which have about 5,000,000 subscribers. Among these are:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(a) General reviews, 8. The most important, finest in tone contents, and artistic execution is the monthly "Hochland", founded in 1903 and edited by Karl Muth; the publisher is J. K&ouml;sel of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and an edition contains 10,000 copies. The list of collaborators contains the names of B&auml;umker, Cardauns, Finke, Grauert, von Handel-Mazzetti, von Hertling, Kiefi, Mausbach, Pastor, Schanz (now deceased), Schell (now deceased), Sch&ouml;nbach, Spahn, Streitberg, Willmann. The monthly called "Der Aar", founded in 1910, seeks to compete with the "Hochland", but falls a little below the other; the editor is Dr. Otto Denk, the publisher is <a href="12583a.htm">Pustet</a> at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. The semi-monthly "Die Historisch-politische Bl&auml;tter", published by Riedel at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, edition 3000 copies, and the "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach", published ten times a year by <a href="07251c.htm">Herder</a> at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, edition 5200 copies, are carried on, on the same lines as heretofore. The "Allgemeine Rundschau", a semi-monthly edited and published by Dr. Armin Kausen at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, devotes itself to the living questions of political and <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>. It specially combats immorality in life and art.</li><li>(b) Theological reviews, 10, <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> papers, about 20. A description has already been given of the "Theologische Quartalschrift", published by Laupp at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, edition 630 copies; and the "Katholik", published by Kirchheim at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, edition 800 copies. A good periodical for <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> literature is the "Theologische Revue", edited by <a href="04785b.htm">Prof. Diekamp</a>, published by Aschendorff at <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, edition 950 copies.</li><li>(c) Family and religious-popular periodicals, 90. The subscription list of the oldest and highest in repute of this class, the "Deutsche Hausschatz", has declined; it is published by <a href="12583a.htm">Pustet</a> at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and its edition in 1900 was 38,000 copies; in 1908, 28,000; the number of copies forming an edition at present is unknown. Large circulations are enjoyed by: the "Stadt Gottes", edited by the Society of the Word of God, at Steyl, edition 140,000 copies; the "Christliche Familie", edited by Dr. Jos. Burg, published by Fredebeul and Koenen at Essen, edition 150,000 copies; the "Katholisches Sonntagsblatt" of Stuttgart, edition 75,000 copies.</li><li>(d) Legal, national, and socio-economic, 6; among these is the "Archiv f&uuml;r katholisches Kirchenrecht", founded by <a href="10608a.htm">Ernst von Moy</a> in 1857, edited later by <a href="15354a.htm">Friedrich H. Vering</a>, and at present by Franz Heiner, published by Kirchheim at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>.</li><li>(e) Scientific periodicals, 3. The most important of these is "Natur und Offenbarung", edited by Dr. Forch, published by Aschendorff at <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, edition 900 copies;</li><li>(f) Philosophical periodicals, 2;</li><li>(g) Educational periodicals, 34;</li><li>(h) Historical periodicals, 10. Among these one of general importance is the "Historisches Jahrbuch der G&ouml;rresgesellschaft", founded in 1880. Its former editors are: H&uuml;ffer, Hermann Grauert, Joseph Weiss; its present editor is Max Jansen; it is published by <a href="07251c.htm">Herder</a> at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, edition about 750 copies.</li><li>(i) Periodicals for historical art, 6. Among these are the two illustrated monthlies "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r christliche Kunst", edited by Prof. Dr. Schn&uuml;tgen, published by Schwann at D&uuml;sseldorf, edition 900 copies; and "Die christliche Kunst", edited by J. Staudhamer, published by the Society for Christian Art of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, edition 6400 copies;</li><li>(j) Periodicals for <a href="10648a.htm">church music</a>, 8.</li><li>(k) Literary journals, 18. Among these are the "Literarischer Haudweiser", published by Theissing at <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, and the "Literarische Rundschau f&uuml;r das katholische Deutschland", edited by Prof. Joseph Sauer, published by <a href="07251c.htm">Herder</a> at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>;</li><li>(l) Missionary periodicals, 14;</li><li>(m) Periodicals for children and youth, 21;</li><li>(n) Periodicals issued by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations, 24.</li></ul></div>

<p>Up to the present time the growth of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> has been both rapid and steady. As the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> number about 21,000,000, there is room for an increase in the sales of these periodicals, and their circulation will probably grow still larger. On the other hand an increase in the number of organs is less <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> and desirable. The effort should rather be made to overcome the decided disparity between quantity and quality. There are, perhaps, no more than a dozen <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dailies which have a really high value. Most of the others limit themselves to a systematic use of correspondence, the collection of notices, and polemics that are not always very skilful; they are also, in part, so monotonous that they can only be enjoyed by an unassuming circle of readers. The relatively small subscription lists of the really important journals and the undue number of small periodicals show that the cultivated classes satisfy their need of reading in part with non-Catholic periodicals. The case is the same with the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> papers. An issue of 10,000 copies is very small for so excellent a review as "Hochland". The satisfaction expressed in each succeeding edition of Keiter's "Handbuch der katholischen Presse" over the growth of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press refers only to quantity. In regard to quality there is little choice.</p>
