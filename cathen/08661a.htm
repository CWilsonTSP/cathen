<h1>Athanasius Kircher</h1>

<p>Celebrated for the versatility of his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and particularly distinguished for his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, b. 2 May, 1601, at Geisa, a small town on the northern bank of the Upper Rhone (<em>Buchonia</em>); d. at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 28 Nov., 1680.</p>

<p>From his birthplace he was accustomed to add the Latin epithet <em>Bucho</em>, or <em>Buchonius</em>, to his name, although later he preferred calling himself <em>Fuldensis</em> after <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, the capital of his native country. The name <em>Athanasius</em> was given him in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="02035a.htm">saint</a> on whose <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> he was born.</p>

<p>John Kircher, the father of <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, had studied <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, without, however, embracing the <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> calling. As soon as he had obtained the doctor's degree in the latter faculty, he went to lecture on <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> house at Seligenstadt. <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> studied humanities at the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">College</a> in <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, and on 2 Oct., 1618, entered the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. At the end of his <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> he repaired to Cologne for his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies. The journey thither was, on account of the confusion caused by the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>, attended with great danger. Together with his study of speculative philosophy the talented young student devoted himself especially to the natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> and the classical languages, for which reason he was shortly afterwards called to teach these branches at the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">colleges</a> in Coblenz and Heiligenstadt. In <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, where Kircher (1625) began his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, he attracted the notice of the elector through his ability and his skill as an experimentalist. In 1628 he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, and hardly had he finished his last year of probation at <a href="14214e.htm">Speyer</a> when the chair of ethics and mathematics was given to him the <a href="15720a.htm">University of W&uuml;rzburg</a>, while at the same time he had to give instructions in the Syrian and Hebrew languages. However, the disorders consequent on the <a href="14648b.htm">wars</a> <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to go first to <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (1631) and later to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The discovery of some hieroglyphic characters in the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="14214e.htm">Speyer</a> led Kircher to make his first attempt to solve the problem of hieroglyphical writing, which still baffled all scholars. At Aix he made the acquaintance of the well-known French senator, Sicolas Peiresc, whose magnificent collections aroused in Kircher the highest interest. Recognizing in Kircher the right man to solve the old <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> riddle, Peiresc applied direct to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to the General of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to have Kircher's call to <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> by the emperor set aside and to procure a summons for the scholar to the <a href="13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>. This generous intention was favoured by <a href="12510a.htm">Providence</a>, inasmuch as Kircher on his way to <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> was shipwrecked near Civit&agrave; Vecchia, and arrived in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his call thither had reached him. Until his death (28 Nov., 1680), <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was now to be the principal scene of Kircher's many-sided activity, which soon developed in such an astonishing way that <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, emperor, princes, and <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> vied with one another in furthering and supporting the investigations of the learned scholar. After six years of successful teaching in the Roman College, where he lectured on physics, mathematics, and Oriental languages, he was released from these <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> that he might have freedom in his studies and might devote himself to formal scientific research, especially in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. He took advantage of a trip to Malta to explore thoroughly the various volcanoes which exist between <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> and that island. He studied especially in 1638 the Strait of Messina, where, besides the noise of the surge, a dull subterranean rumble attracted his attention. At <a href="15023a.htm">Trapani</a> and Palermo his interest was aroused by the remains of antediluvian elephants. But before all else he tried to discover the subterranean power of the volcanoes of Etna and Stromboli, then in eruption; public attention had been called to such mysterious phenomena by the frightful eruption of Vesuvius in 1630.</p>

<p>When Kircher left <a href="10216a.htm">Messina</a> in 1638 to return to <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, a terrible earthquake occurred which destroyed the city of Euphemia. Like Pliny before him (A.D. 79), Kircher wished to study at close range this powerful convulsion of nature. On reaching <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> he at once climbed Vesuvius, and had himself lowered by means of a rope into the crater of the volcanic mountain and with the help of his pantometer ascertained exactly the different dimensions of the crater and its inner structure. As the <a href="06082a.htm">firstfruits</a> of his travels he published, for the <a href="07477a.htm">Knights of Malta</a>, "Specula Melitensis Encyclica sive syntagma novum instrumentorum physico-mathematicorum" (Messina, 1638). It was forty years later that the fully matured results of theses investigations appeared in Kircher's great work, the "Mundus Subterraneus", in two volumes (Amsterdam, 1678), which enjoyed the greatest repute in his time; not only did it give an incentive to the more searching investigation of subterranean forces, but it contributed much to their final explanation. When again in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Kircher began collecting all kinds of antiquities and ethnologically important remains, thus laying the foundation of the well-known museum which, as the "Museum Kircherianum", still attracts today so many visitors to the Roman College. Epoch-making also were Kircher's labours in the domain of deciphering hieroglyphics, and, on the excavation of the so-called Pamphylian obelisk, he succeeded in supplying correctly the portions which had been concealed from him. It must be remembered that in those days little or no attention was paid to this subject, and that it was therefore in itself a great service to have taken the initiative in this branch of investigation, however lacking his efforts may have been in the fundamental principles of the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> as it is known today. Kircher also gave an impetus to the intimate study of the relations between the different languages: Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaic, <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, <a href="13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, Arabic, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, Coptic, <a href="11712a.htm">Persian</a>, Ethiopian, Italian, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese.</p>

<p>Thus in the most varied branches of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> Kircher played the r&ocirc;le of pioneer. Even medicine received his attention, as is shown for example by his treatise, "Scrutinium physico-medicum contagios&aelig; luis, qu&aelig; pestis dicitur" (Rome, 1658). He also tried to form a universal language ("Polygraphia seu artificium lingarum, quo cum omnibus totius mundi populis poterit quis correspondere", Rome, 1663). His scientific activities brought him into scientific correspondence with scholars labouring in the most different fields, as the numerous volumes of his extant letters show. It is to his inventive mind that we owe one of the earliest of our counting machines: the speaking-tube and &aelig;olian harp were perfected by him. He was also the inventor of the magic lantern which has since been brought to such perfection and is today almost indispensable.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>That the most varied judgments should be formed and expressed on a man of such encyclop&aelig;dic <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was only to be expected. He tried to find a grain of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> even in the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> of <a href="01272b.htm">alchemy</a>, <a href="02018e.htm">astrology</a>, and horoscopy, which were still in his time much in vogue, nor is it surprising that in the province of <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a> he did not at this early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> defend the <a href="04352b.htm">Copernican</a> System.</p>

<p>With all his learning and vast amount of adulation which he received on all sides, Kircher retained throughout his life a deep <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> and a childlike <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. In 1629 he had intimated to his general his desire to devoted his life exclusively to the spreading of the Faith in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, but this wish remained unfulfilled, and, to console himself for this disappointment, he erected during his last years a sanctuary (della Mentorella) in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> on the crest of the Sabine Hill near <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither, during his lifetime as now, thousands made <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> and found help and consolation. In this sanctuary Kircher's heart was buried, and at the beginning of the twentieth century this place of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> was distinguished by a gigantic <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of our <a href="08374c.htm">Divine Redeemer</a> on the neighbouring crest of Guadagnole.</p>

<p>To give an approximate <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of Kircher's literary activity it is only <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to remark that during his sojourn in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> no less than forty-four folio volumes came from his pen. A full list of his writings is to be found in Sommervogel, "Bibl. Scriptorum S.J.". Besides the works already named, it is sufficient to mention here: "Magnes sive de arte magnetica" (Rome, 1640; Cologne, 1643, 1654); "Lingua &aelig;gyptiaca restituta" (Rome, 1643); "Ars magna lucis et umbr&aelig;" (Rome, 1644); "Musurgia universalis sive ars consoni et dissoni" (Rome, 1650); "Itinerarium extaticum s. opificium coeleste" (Rome, 1656); "Iter extaticum secundum, mundi subterranei prodromus" (Rome, 1657); "Obeliscus Pamphylius" (Rome, 1650).</p>
