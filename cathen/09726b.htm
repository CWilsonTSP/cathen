<p>Antiquary, historiographer, architect, educationist, b. 4 October, 1804, at Auray, seat of the famous shrine of St. Ann in Brittany, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; d. at Vaugirard, Paris, 25 November, 1886. His father, Jacques Augustin Martin, for many years mayor of Auray and Attorney-General of Morbihan, was a public benefactor. His mother was Anne Arnel Lauzer de Kerzo, a truly <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> matron, of whose ten children three entered religious communities, while the others, as heads of <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>, shone in Breton <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> as models of every domestic <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Felix, having made his classical studies at the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> close by the shrine of St. Anne, entered the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Montrouge, Paris, 27 September, 1823, but on the opening of a new <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, in Aug., 1824, he was transferred there. Thence in 1826 he was sent to the one time famous college of Arc, at D&ocirc;le, to complete his <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a> and gain his first experience in the management of youth among its 400 pupils. The following scholastic year, 1826-1827, at St-Acheul, he began his career as teacher. This was soon to be interrupted, for already among the revolutionists of the boulevards and in the Chamber of Deputies, the wildest and most preposterous accusations had been formulated against the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. This agitation culminated on 16 June, 1828, in the "Ordonnances de Charles X" which were to be enforced the following October. The Fathers, meanwhile, quietly closed their colleges, their teachers went into temporary exile and among them Fr. Martin. He spent the succeeding years in colleges established across the frontier.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, Brieg and Estavay&eacute;; in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Le Passage near St. Sebastian; in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, the College of Brugelette, were in turn the scenes of his labours as student or as teacher. It was when he was in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, in 1831, that he received <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. Eleven years later, while engaged in the ministry at Angers he was informed that, under Father Chazelle, ex-rector of St. Mary's College, <a href="08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, he was chosen together with Fathers Hainpaux, Tellier and Dominique du Ranquet to restore the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, extinct since the death of <a href="03402c.htm">Father Jean Joseph Casot</a> at Quebec on 16 March, 1842. On 2 July, Mgr. Bourget, at whose invitation the fathers had come, confided to them the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Laprairie, deprived of its <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>, the Rev. Michael Power, by his promotion to the newly erected <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of <a href="14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, 26 June, 1842. On 31 July, 1844, Fr. Martin was named superior of the mission in Lower <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, now the <a href="12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>. The enthusiastic citizens of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> had generously subscribed towards the building of a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a>, his principal preoccupation. In May, 1847, ground was broken and the foundations were laid. Then came a series of disasters which interrupted all further work. The greater portion of Laprairie was swept by fire and the presbytery of the fathers was reduced to ashes. The great conflagration of Quebec followed, whereby a vast portion of the city was destroyed. Thousands of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants were pouring into the country; in 1847 the numbers reached nearly 100,000. With them they brought the dreaded typhus or ship-fever. In that year alone nearly two thousand were stricken down in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. With <a href="06147a.htm">Christian intrepidity</a> the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of St. Sulpice, <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the city, devoted themselves to the spiritual relief of the sick and dying, and five at the outset fell victims to their <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Fathers Paul Mignard and Henri du Ranquet, arriving from New York gave timely assistance. But this was far from sufficient, so Fr. Martin appealed to Fr. Th&eacute;baud, <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. John's, <a href="15203b.htm">Fordham</a>, for volunteers to assist the plague-stricken. The answer was the immediate arrival of Fathers Driscoll, Dumerle, Ferard and Schianski. All escaped the contagion except Fr. Dumerle, who fell a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> of charity.</p>

<p>The <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of St. Sulpice, whose ranks were thinned by the ravages of the plague, asked for four English-speaking Fathers to take charge of St. Patrick's Church. A presbytery was provided for them near the very ground whereon the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> had been commenced. In it there was room sufficient to house a few teachers. A temporary structure was put up, and opened as a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> on 20 September, 1848. A few boarders even were received and lodged in a small tenement in a street hard by. It was not till the month of May, 1850, that work was resumed on the college building, but so strenuously was it prosecuted that Mgr Bourget was invited to <a href="02599b.htm">bless</a> it, in its advanced stage of completion, on 31 July, 1851, feast of St. Ignatius. On 4 August the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was transferred from its temporary quarters in M. Rodier's house, and installed in the new edifice, and in the beginning of September everything was in perfect working order in the young institution of learning, from under whose roof, in later years, so many remarkable men were to go forth as statesmen, judges, physicians and members of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of the bar. This was Fr. Martin's achievement. But he was not only the founder of St. Mary's College, the financier, the architect, and the overseer of the material construction, he was also the systematizer of its curriculum during his rectorship which lasted until 1857. The stately pile of St. Patrick's Church, <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, was also of his designing, the main outlines of which are in pure thirteenth-century Gothic. Fr. Martin was the originator of the well-known Archives of St. Mary's College, and the principal collector of the records of an almost forgotten past. With such men as <a href="15426a.htm">Viger</a>, <a href="05787a.htm">Faribault</a>, E. G. O'Callaghan, etc., he quickened, if he really did not set on foot, that campaign of research which ended in the placing within reach of all the original historical sources of the colonial and missionary days of <a href="12598a.htm">New France</a>. <br>No better account of Fr. Martin's labours in this field could be given than that which appeared a few months after his death in the "Catholic World" (N. Y., April, 1887): "But, it is, perhaps, as an antiquarian and a man of letters that Fr. Martin has become most generally known. His services to historical literature, particularly the history of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, have been many and great. He devoted himself amidst all his onerous <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> to the task of throwing light on the dark places of the past. He was commissioned by Government to explore the regions where of old the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had toiled amongst the <a href="07565a.htm">Hurons</a>, giving at last to the dusky tribes the priceless gifts of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. He wrote at this time a work embellished with various plans and drawings, all of which remained in possession of the Government. He also collected many curious Indian relics. In 1857 he was sent by the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Government to <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> on a scientific mission, and was likewise entrusted with the task of examining the Archives of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> for points of interest in relation to <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> history. In this he was eminently successful. He discovered a number of unpublished documents relating to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> which would be sufficient to fill a folio volume. Perhaps his most eminent service to historical literature was his great share in bringing out the 'Relations des J&eacute;suites' [1611-1672], a very mine of information for the scholar.&hellip; He discovered and put into print, with preface and most valuable annotations by himself, the 'Relations' extending from 1672 to 1679. He added to them two geographical charts.&hellip; Fr. Martin also translated from Italian to French the 'Relation' of <a href="02766a.htm">P&#232;re Bressani</a>, which he published with notes, together with a biography of that glorious <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>. His historical works included Lives of <a href="03567a.htm">Samuel de Champlain</a> (?), the founder of Quebec, of Fathers Br&eacute;beuf, <a href="03645a.htm">Chaumonot</a> and <a href="08420b.htm">Jogues</a> [and, not mentioned in the article, of Montcalm]. The latter [that of Fr. Jogues] has become known to the American public through the translation made by our foremost <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historian, John Gilmary Shea. Fr. Martin was the friend, adviser, and co-labourer of the eminent <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> historical writer, <a href="15426a.htm">J. Viger</a>." And letters preserved in the College archives attest that his relations with E. B. O'Callaghan, compiler of the "Documentary History of New York", were of a kindred nature.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Among his lesser publications may be mentioned: "Notice Biographique de la M&#232;re S. Stanislas [his sister] Religieuse de la Misericorde de J&eacute;sus, de la H&ocirc;tel-Dieu d'Auray, 1886", "Manuel du P&eacute;lerin &#224; N. D.de Bonsecours", "Neuvaine &#224; St. Fran&#231;ois Xavier" and "Neuvaine &#224; St. Antoine* de Padoue". After his return from <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, in 1858 and 1859, he was bursar of St. Mary's College, and the two following years, 1860 and 1861, superior of the Quebec residence. His eyesight was already much impaired, and the glare of the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> snows was very trying, so much so that he was threatened with total blindness. For this reason he was recalled to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. He spent part of the year 1862 at Ste Genevi&#232;ve College, Paris, and was appointed on the 12 September (1862) <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a>.</p>

<p>After three years, on 8 Sept., 1865, he was named superior of the residence of the Holy Name at <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. Thence he was transferred to Vaugirard College at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he had the <a href="05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of the house for six years. On 5 Sept., 1874, he went to Rouen for three years as superior, and returned to Vaugirard in 1878. At the closing of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">colleges</a> by the arbitrary enactments of the French Republic, the community of Vaugirard was dispersed, and Fr. Martin, with a few others of his fellow religious took up their abode in 1882 at No. 1 Rue Desnouettes. Here he remained for five years patiently awaiting the final call of the Master, though never ceasing to collect materials bearing on the history of the country of his predilection. Physically, Fr. Martin was of medium height, heavily built, but carrying his weight lightly and with dignity. His name is a household word for all who are given to historical research not only in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> of today but throughout the vast territory comprised within the vaguely defined limits of <a href="12598a.htm">New France</a>.</p>
