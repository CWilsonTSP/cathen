<p>Under this title will be treated only the suppressions of <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> (whether monastic in the strict sense or houses of the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>) since the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The somewhat more general subject of state encroachments on <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a> will be found treated under such titles as <a href="08744a.htm">LAICIZATION</a>; <a href="04155b.htm">COMMENDATORY ABBOT</a>; <a href="08084c.htm">CONFLICT OF INVESTITURES</a>. The <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> motives of state opposition to the tenure of lands by religious corporations (dating from the thirteenth century) are explained under <a href="10579a.htm">MORTMAIN</a>. The countries dealt with in the present article are <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the Iberian Peninsula, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. <a href="10455a.htm">The suppression of English monasteries</a> is covered in its own article. (For French suppressions, see <a href="06166a.htm">FRANCE</a>, especially sub-title, The Third Republic and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.)</p>

<p>The confiscation of religious <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> following upon the Treaty of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648) had been for the benefit of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes only. More than a hundred <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and innumerable <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> foundations disappeared at this time. Towards the middle of the eighteenth century a new movement tending to the destruction of monastic institutions swept over those portions of the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a> which had remained attached to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. "Josephinism", as this political and religious movement was afterwards called, taking its name from its foster-father, the <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, made the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> subservient to the State. The <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> was ignored; <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> could be permitted to exist only on giving <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of their material utility. A plan was formed at this period for the general secularization of monastic and other <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> for the profit of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Governments in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. This was part of a general plan for a redistribution of territory. <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (the Great) of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had taken the initiative and had won over <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to his <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>. The opposition of <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, of the Prince <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and of <a href="02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a> caused the project to fail. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> kept the diplomacy of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in check for some years. To counteract the action of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on public sentiment, the partisans of secularization encouraged in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> the spread of those <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> &#151; <a href="10041b.htm">Materialism</a> and <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> &#151; which were then gaining ground in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (see <a href="05418a.htm">ENCYCLOPEDISTS</a>). With this view they succeeded in withdrawing the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> from Roman influence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the princes approached the task directly. The Elector Maximilian (Joseph) III (1745-77) began in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> a work of destruction which was carried on by his successors down to the Elector Maximilian Joseph IV, <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> ally, who became King Maximilian I of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in 1805 (d. 1825). Measures were taken first against the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>; the <a href="02137c.htm">secular power</a> began to meddle in the government of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, a commission being appointed by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> for that purpose. In the meantime (1773) the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a> was decreed. About the year 1782 the Elector Charles Theodore (1778-99) obtained the assent of <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> to a project for the extinction of several religious foundations. The Elector Maximilian Joseph IV (King Maximilian I) of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> completed the work of destruction, influenced by the policy of his ally, <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, and assisted by the Count of Montgelas, his chief minister. A <a href="12783b.htm">rescript</a> of 9 September, 1800, deprived the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> of all <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and prohibited them to receive <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>. The <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> (Franciscans, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Augustinians, <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>) and the <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> were the first to fall. Then came the turn of the <a href="03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> and the Benedictines. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were not spared. Among the <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> that disappeared in 1803 may be mentioned; St. Blasien of the Black Forest (the community, however, being admitted, in 1809, to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Paul), St. Emmeran of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Andechs, St. Ulrich of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, Michelsberg, Benedictbeurn, Ertal, Kempten, Metten, Oberaltaich, Ottobeurn, Scheyern, Tegernsee, Wessobr&uuml;nn.</p>

<p>The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in other parts of North <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> met with the common fate of all <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>. On the left bank of the Rhine they were suppressed when that territory was annexed to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by the Peace of Luneville, 9 February, 1801. Their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> was disposed of by the Diet of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (3 March, 1801- February, 1803), the deplorable business having been negotiated in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> with <a href="10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> and Talleyrand. Besides her twenty-five <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principalities and her eighteen <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> lost all her <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and her <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for men: their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> was given to <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. As to the <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, the princes were to consult with <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> before proceeding to expel their inmates. The future reception of <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a> was forbidden. In the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, the Principality of <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and the portions of <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> annexed by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> disappeared completely.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the territories <a href="05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the House of Hapsburg, the secularization of <a href="01010a.htm">monastic houses</a> had begun more than thirty years before this. In pursuance of the policy with which his name has been especially associated, the <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> (d. 1790) forbade the teaching of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, even to the young religious, and also the reception of <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>. Intercourse with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was placed under imperial control. It was forbidden to receive foreign religious. The <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> interfered in the regular discipline of communities. Commendatory <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> were appointed. Monasteries were deprived of the <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> belonging to them. Superiors had to account to the emperor's representatives for the disposition of their incomes. Theological works printed outside the Empire could not be used. &#151; Such were the principal lines of action of this administration, of which <a href="08611b.htm">Kaunitz</a> was the minister. All this, however, was but the prelude to a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of suppression which was issued on 17 March, 1783.</p>

<p>This <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> applied to all <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, whether of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> or of men, judged useless by the standards of Josephinism; their revenues were taken to increase the salaries of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> or for <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> establishments useful to religion and humanity. The <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the Low Countries (then subject to the House of Hapsburg) lost one hundred and sixty-eight <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, or <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a>. In all, 738 <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> were suppressed in the Empire during the reign of <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>.</p>

<p>In anticipation of this disaster, <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> had conferred on the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> extensive privileges. They had power to dispense expelled religious, both men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, from wearing their habit, and, in case of necessity, to dispense them from the simple <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>. They were to secure for them a pension &#151; but, as this was generally insufficient, many were reduced to poverty. The Government transformed the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> into <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, colleges, or barracks. The victims of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> remained faithful to their religious <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a>. Their ordinaries took great care of them. Cardinal de Frankenberg, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, affording a particularly bright example in this respect. The <a href="10167a.htm">Abbey of Melk</a> was spared; some of the suppressed houses were even affiliated to it; but on the death of Abbot Urban I (1783), the emperor placed over the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> a religious of the Pious Schools as <a href="04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a>. The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Styria were soon closed, though some houses &#151; e.g., Kremsm&uuml;nster, Lambach, Admont &#151; escaped the devastation. All those in Carinthia and the Tyrol were sacrificed. The religious in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> had not yet recovered from the ravages caused by the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> and <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, when they had to encounter this fresh tempest. Breunau, Emmaus of Prague, and Raigern, with a few <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> and <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, escaped complete ruin. The emperor showed no consideration toward the venerable Abbey of St. Martin of Pannonia and its dependencies. In <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> were entirely wiped out.</p>

<p>The death of <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> put an end to this <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a>, without, however, stopping the spread of those opinions which had incited it. His brother, Leopold II (d. 1792) allowed things to remain as he found them, but Francis II (Francis I of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, son of Leopold II) undertook to repair some of the ruin, permitting religious to pronounce solemn <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> at the age of twenty-one. The Hungarian Abbey of St. Martin of Pannonia was the first to profit by this benevolence, but its <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> had to open the gymnasia in it and its dependencies. The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the Tyrol and Salzburg had escaped the ruin. These countries were attached to <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> by the Congress of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (September, 1814 &#151; June, 1815). The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were allowed to re-enter. The celebrated Abbey of <a href="12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> alone did not arise from its ruins. The princely Abbey of St. Gall, too, had been dissolved during the Wars of the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> and the Empire, and there was a proposal, at the Congrss of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, to re-establish it, but without giving it back its lands: the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> would not accept the conditions thus imposed, and the matter went no further. The <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were exposed to pillage and ruin during the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. The Government of the Helvetian Republic was hostile to them, they recovered a little liberty after the Act of Mediation, in 1803. But the situation changed after 1832. The Federal Constitution, revised at that time, suppressed the guarantees granted to <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> and religious foundations. During the long period of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> and confiscation in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, from 1838 to 1848 (for which see <a href="09406b.htm">LUCERNE</a>), the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Mariastein sought refuge in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and then in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>; those of Mury were sheltered at Griess (Tyrol), others like Disentis, fell into utter ruin. The <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> then went to the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, where they founded the Swiss-American congregation.</p>

<h2 id="section2">The Iberian peninsula</h2>

<p>The constitution of 1812 given to the Kingdom of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> by the government which <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> imposed on it suppressed all religious congregations and confiscated their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, in accordance with the conqueror's general policy. They were re-established in 1814 by King Ferdinand, whom the War of Independence had restored to the throne. Their existence was again threatened by the Revolution of 1820, when the Cortes decreed the suppression of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, leaving only a few houses to shelter the aged and infirm. It must be said that, in this case, the effect of the generally anti-religious principles actuating the revolutionists was reinforced by the impoverishment of the nation by the Napoleonic <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, by the revolt of its American colonies, and by changed <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions. Ferdinand VII, who was restored to the throne by the French Army, hastened to annul the decrees of the cortes (1823). The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> were given back to the religious, who were enabled once more to live in community. But in October, 1835, a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the government, inspired by Juan de Mendizabal, minister of finance, again suppressed all the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and its possessions. The Cortes, which had not been consulted, approved of this measure next year, and <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a law abolishing <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion. All the movable and immovable <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated and the income assigned to the sinking fund. Objects of art and books were, in general, reserved for the museums and public <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a>, though many of them were left untouched, and many others dispersed. Large quantities of furniture and other objects were sold, the lands and <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of each house alienated, while speculators realized large fortunes. Certain <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were transformed into barracks or devoted to public purposes. Others were sold or abandoned to pillage.</p>

<p>In 1859 the Government gave to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> those <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> which had not already been disposed of. Numerous conventual churches were turned over for <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> use. The religious were promised a pension not to exceed one franc a day, but it was never paid. No mercy was shown even to the aged and the infirm, who were not allowed to wait for death in their cells. Almost all hoped for an approaching political change that would restore them their religious liberty, as had happened twice before, but the event <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> otherwise. The destruction was irrevocable, some religious sought a refuge in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The greater number either petitioned the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to incorporate them in their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> or went to live with their <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>. The people of the Northern provinces, who are very devoted to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, did not associate themselves directly with the measures taken against the religious; so much cannot be said for those of the South and of the large towns, where the expulsion of religious sometimes took the appearance of a popular insurrection: <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> were pillaged and burned, religious were massacred. Monasteries of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> were treated less inhumanly: here the authorities contented themselves with confiscating <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> and suppressing privileges; but the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> continued to live in community. With time the passion and <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecutors</a> diminished somewhat. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of the abbey of Montserrat in Catalonia were able to come together again. The <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders which supplied the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> for the Spanish colonies, such as the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Augustinians, and <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, were authorized to retain some houses.</p>

<p>The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> met the same fate as those in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and at about the same time (1833). Only the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> charged with religious <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> in the <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> colonies were spared.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Italy</h2>

<p>During the eighteenth century, while Josephinism was rampant in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Leopold, afterwards the Emperor Leopold II, tried to emulate in some degree the emperor's anti-monastic policy. But the general <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> did not begin until the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> and the Empire had effected a complete transformation in that country. <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> inspired with her anti-religious tendencies the new governments established by <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a> was confiscated; <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> were suppressed, though congregations devoted to the care of the sick and to the instruction of poor children were tolerated here and there as, for instance, in the <a href="08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>, founded in 1805. The repressive measures could not be enforced in all localities with equal severity. <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> extended them to the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1810. At <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> the authorities proceeded to suppress all the orders and confiscate their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> (1806-13). When the Congress of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> restored these states to their exiled rulers, the latter hastened to make the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> free once more. In <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> the duke made a grant to the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, in exchange for the lands that they had lost. In the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> things reverted to the ancient order: 1824 houses for men and 612 for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> were re-established. In <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> the religious had diminished by at least one-half.</p>

<p>The period of peace, however, was not destined to endure: the establishment of Italian unity was fatal to the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> was resumed in the constitutional <a href="13473b.htm">Kingdom of Sardinia</a>, which was about to become the agent and the type of united <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Cavour imposed this anti-religious policy on King Victor Emmanuel. He proposed first to secularize the monastic <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>: the money thus obtained was to serve as a church fund to equalize the payment of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The king finally gave his sanction to a law which suppressed, in his own states alone, 334 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, containing 4280 religious men and 1200 <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. This ruin and depredation proceeded uniformly with the cause of Italian unity, since the <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> constitution and legislation were imposed on the whole peninsula. The <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> not charged with cures of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> were declared useless, and suppressed; the buildings and lands were confiscated and sold (1866). The Government paid allowances to the surviving religious. In some <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> &#151; as at <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> &#151; the members of the community were allowed to remain as care-takers. The <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> were subjected to the same policy after 1870. The Italian authorities contented themselves with depriving the religious of their legal existence and all they possessed, without raising any obstacles to a possible reconstruction of regular communities. A certain number of <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> have thus been able to exist and carry on their work, owing solely to the guarantee of individual liberty; their existence is precarious, and an arbitrary measure of the Government might at any time suppress them. After the general dissolution, some <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> religious &#151; for instance, the <a href="11244c.htm">Olivetans</a> and the <a href="03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St. John Lateran &#151; crossed the Alps and established houses of their respective orders in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>
