<p><a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, b. at <a href="11089b.htm">Nola</a> in Campania, in the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, in 1548; d. at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1600. At the age of eleven he went to <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, to study "humanity, logic, and dialectic", and, four years later, he entered the <a href="12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, giving up his worldly name of Filippo and taking that of <a href="06564b.htm">Giordano</a>. He made his <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> and continued to study there. In 1572 he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>.</p>

<p>It seems, however, that, even as a <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a>, he attracted attention by the originality of his views and by his outspoken criticism of accepted <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> doctrines. After his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> things reached such a pass that, in 1576, formal accusation of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> was brought against him. Thereupon he went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but, apparently, did not mend his manner of speaking of the mysteries of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>; for the accusations were renewed against him at the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Minerva. Within a few months of his arrival he fled the city and cast off all allegiance to his order.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From this point on, his life-story is the tale of his wanderings from one country to another and of his failure to find peace anywhere. He tarried awhile in several Italian cities, and in 1579 went to Geneva, where he seems to have adopted the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, although afterwards, before the <a href="04447a.htm">ecclesiastical tribunal</a> at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, he steadfastly denied that he had ever joined the Reformed Church. This much at least is certain; he was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> Council on account of his disrespectful attitude towards the heads of that Church and was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the city. Thence he went to <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and (in 1581) to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>.</p>

<p>At Lyons he completed his "Clavis Magna", or "Great Key" to the art of remembering. In <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> he published several works which further developed his art of memory-training and revealed the two-fold influence of <a href="12670c.htm">Raymond Lully</a> and the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>. In 1582 he published a characteristic work, "Il candelaio", or "The Torchbearer", a satire in which he exhibits in a marked degree the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> taste then in vogue among the <a href="07538b.htm">humanists</a>, many of whom mistook obscenity for humour. While at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> he lectured publicly on philosophy, under the auspices, as it seems, of the College of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, the forerunner of the College of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<p>In 1583 he crossed over to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and, for a time at least, enjoyed the favour of Queen Elizabeth and the friendship of Sir Philip Sidney. To the latter he dedicated the most bitter of his attacks on the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, "Il spaccio della bestia trionfante", "The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast", published in 1584. He visited Oxford, and, on being refused the privilege of lecturing there, he published (1584) his "Cena delle ceneri", or "Ash-Wednesday Supper", in which he attacked the Oxford professors, saying that they <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> more about beer than about Greek. In 1585 he returned to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and during the year which he spent in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> at this time made several attempts to become reconciled to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, all of which failed because of his refusal to accept the condition imposed, namely, that he should return to his order.</p>

<p>In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, whither he went in 1587, he showed the same spirit of insolent self-assertion as at Oxford. In Helmstadt he was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. After some time spent in literary activity at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, he went, in 1591, to <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> at the invitation of Mocenigo, who professed to be interested in his system of memory-training. Failing to obtain from Bruno the secret of his "natural magic", Mocenigo denounced him to the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. Bruno was arrested, and in his trial before the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> inquisitors first took refuge in the principle of "two-fold truth", saying that the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> imputed to him were held by him "as a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and not as an honest <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>"; later, however, he solemnly <a href="01044d.htm">abjured</a> all his <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> and <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> in the matter of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and practice (Berti, Docum., XII, 22 and XIII, 45). At this point the Roman <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> intervened and requested his extradition. After some hesitation the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> authorities agreed, and in February, 1593, Bruno was sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and for six years was kept in the <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. Historians have striven in vain to discover the explanation of this long delay on the part of the Roman authorities. In the spring of 1599, the trial was begun before a commission of the Roman <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and, after the accused had been granted several terms of respite in which to retract his <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>, he was finally condemned (January, 1600), handed over to the <a href="02137c.htm">secular power</a> (8 February), and burned at the stake in the Campo dei Fiori in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (17 February). Bruno was not condemned for his defence of the <a href="04352b.htm">Copernican</a> system of <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, nor for his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the plurality of inhabited worlds, but for his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>, among which were the following: that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> but merely an unusually skilful magician, that the Holy Ghost is the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of the world, that the <a href="04764a.htm">Devil</a> will be saved, etc.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>To the works of Bruno already mentioned the following are to be added: "Della causa, principio ed uno"; "Dell' infinito universo e dei mondi"; "De Compendios&acirc; Architectur&acirc;"; "De Triplici Minimo"; "De Monade, Numero et Figur&acirc;." In these "the Nolan" expounds a system of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in which the principal elements are <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>, materialistic monism, rational <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> (after the manner of <a href="12670c.htm">Raymond Lully</a>), and the naturalistic concept of the unity of the material world (inspired by the <a href="04352b.htm">Copernican</a> <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>). His attitude towards <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> is best illustrated by his reiterated assertion that the natural philosophy of the <a href="01713a.htm">Stagirite</a> is vitiated by the predominance of the <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> over the mathematical mode of conceiving natural phenomena. Towards the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> in general his feeling was one of undisguised contempt; he excepted, however, Albert the Great and <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, for whom he always maintained a high degree of respect. He wished to reform the <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> philosophy, and yet he was bitterly opposed to his contemporaries, Ramus and Patrizzi, whose efforts were directed towards the same object. He was acquainted, though only in a superficial way, with the writings of the pre-Socratic <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of Greece, and with the works of the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>, especially with the books falsely attributed to Iamblichus and Plotinus. From the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a> he derived the tendency of his thought towards monism. From the pre-Socratic <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> he borrowed the materialistic interpretation of the One. From the <a href="04352b.htm">Copernican</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which was attracting so much attention in the century in which he lived, he learned to identify the material One with the visible, <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>, heliocentric <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, his system of thought is an incoherent materialistic <a href="11447b.htm">pantheism</a>. <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the world are one; matter and spirit, body and <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, are two phases of the same substance; the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> is <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>; beyond the visible world there is an <a href="08004a.htm">infinity</a> of other worlds, each of which is inhabited; this terrestrial globe has a <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>; in fact, each and every part of it, mineral as well as plant and animal, is animated; all matter is made up of the same elements (no distinction between terrestrial and celestial matter); all <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> are akin (transmigration is, therefore, not impossible). This unitary point of view is Bruno's justification of "natural magic." No doubt, the attempt to establish a scientific continuity among all the phenomena of nature is an important manifestation of the modern spirit, and interesting, especially on account of its appearance at the moment when the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> point of view was being abandoned. And one can readily understand how Bruno's effort to establish a unitary concept of nature commanded the admiration of such men as <a href="14217a.htm">Spinoza</a>, Jacobi, and <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel</a>. On the other hand, the exaggerations, the limitations, and the positive <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of his scientific system; his intolerance of even those who were working for the reforms to which he was devoted; the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> analogies, fantastic allegories, and sophistical reasonings into which his emotional fervour often betrayed him have justified, in the eyes of many, Bayle's characterization of him as "the knight-errant of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>." His attitude of mind towards religious <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> was that of a <a href="12652a.htm">rationalist</a>. Personally, he failed to feel any of the vital significance of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as a religious system. It was not a Roman Inquisitor, but a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> divine, who said of him that he was "a man of great capacity, with <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but not a trace of religion."</p>
