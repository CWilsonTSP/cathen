<p>Born at Stridon, a town on the confines of <a href="04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and Pannonia, about the year 340-2; died at <a href="02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, 30 September, 420.</p>

<p>He went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, probably about 360, where he was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and became <a href="08075a.htm">interested</a> in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. From <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he went to <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, famous for its <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and there began his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. Later he went to <a href="01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, and towards 373 he set out on a journey to the East. He settled first in <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, where he heard <a href="01617a.htm">Apollinaris of Laodicea</a>, one of the first <a href="05692b.htm">exegetes</a> of that <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> and not yet separated from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. From 374-9 Jerome led an <a href="01767c.htm">ascetical</a> life in the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> of Chalcis, southwest of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. <a href="11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, he went to <a href="04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> (380-81), where a friendship sprang up between him and <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>. From 382 to August 385 he made another sojourn in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, not far from <a href="04614a.htm">Pope Damasus</a>. When the latter died (11 December, 384) his position became a very difficult one. His harsh criticisms had made him bitter enemies, who tried to ruin him. After a few months he was compelled to leave <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. By way of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and Alexandria he reached <a href="02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, in 386. He settled there in a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> near a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> founded by two <a href="13164a.htm">Roman</a> ladies, <a href="11582a.htm">Paula</a> and Eustochium, who followed him to Palestine. Henceforth he led a life of <a href="01767c.htm">asceticism</a> and study; but even then he was troubled by controversies which will be mentioned later, one with Rufinus and the other with the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>.</p>

<h2>Chronology</h2>

<p>The literary activity of St. Jerome, although very prolific, may be summed up under a few principal heads: works on the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>; <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversies; historical works; various letters; translations. But perhaps the <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a> of his more important writings will enable us to follow more easily the development of his studies.</p>

<p>A first period extends to his sojourn in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (382), a period of preparation. From this period we have the translation of the <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> on <a href="08333c.htm">Jeremias</a>, <a href="05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a>, and <a href="08179b.htm">Isaias</a> (379-81), and about the same <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> the translation of the <a href="05616a.htm">Chronicle of Eusebius</a>; then the "Vita S. Pauli, prima eremitae" (374-379).</p>

<p>A second period extends from his sojourn in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the beginning of the translation of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> from the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> (382-390). During this period the <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> <a href="15498a.htm">vocation</a> of St. Jerome asserted itself under the influence of <a href="04614a.htm">Pope Damasus</a>, and took definite shape when the opposition of the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> compelled the caustic <a href="04606b.htm">Dalmatian</a> to renounce ecclesiastical advancement and retire to <a href="02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. In 384 we have the correction of the <a href="09023a.htm">Latin</a> version of the <a href="06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>; in 385, the <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>; in 384, a first revision of the <a href="09023a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="12543b.htm">Psalms</a> according to the accepted text of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> (<a href="13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>); in 384, the revision of the <a href="09023a.htm">Latin</a> version of the <a href="08413a.htm">Book of Job</a>, after the accepted version of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>; between 386 and 391 a second revision of the <a href="09023a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, this time according to the text of the <a href="07316a.htm">"Hexapla"</a> of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (<a href="06357a.htm">Gallican</a> <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, embodied in the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>). It is <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether he revised the entire version of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> according to the Greek of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>. In 382-383 <a href="../fathers/3005.htm">"Altercatio Luciferiani et Orthodoxi"</a> and <a href="../fathers/3007.htm">"De perpetua Virginitate B. Mariae; adversus Helvidium"</a>. In 387-388, <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> on the <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> to <a href="11797b.htm">Philemon</a>, to the <a href="06336a.htm">Galatians</a>, to the <a href="05485a.htm">Ephesians</a>, to Titus; and in 389-390, on <a href="05244b.htm">Ecclesiastes</a>.</p>

<p>Between 390 and 405, St. Jerome gave all his attention to the translation of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> according to the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>, but this work alternated with many others. Between 390-394 he translated the <a href="08647b.htm">Books of Samuel and of Kings</a>, <a href="08413a.htm">Job</a>, <a href="12505b.htm">Proverbs</a>, <a href="05244b.htm">Ecclesiastes</a>, the <a href="03302a.htm">Canticle of Canticles</a>, <a href="05535a.htm">Esdras</a>, and <a href="11472a.htm">Paralipomena</a>. In 390 he translated the treatise "De Spiritu Sancto" of <a href="04784a.htm">Didymus of Alexandria</a>; in 389-90, he drew up his "Quaestiones hebraicae in Genesim" and "De interpretatione nominum hebraicorum." In 391-92 he wrote the <a href="../fathers/3003.htm">"Vita S. Hilarionis"</a>, the <a href="../fathers/3006.htm">"Vita Malchi, monachi captivi"</a>, and <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> on <a href="10670a.htm">Nahum</a>, <a href="10278a.htm">Micheas</a>, <a href="14146a.htm">Sophonias</a>, <a href="01209d.htm">Aggeus</a>, <a href="07097a.htm">Habacuc</a>. In 392-93, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm">"De viris illustribus"</a>, and <a href="../fathers/3009.htm">"Adversus Jovinianum"</a>; in 395, <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> on <a href="08497b.htm">Jonas</a> and <a href="01030b.htm">Abdias</a>; in 398, revision of the remainder of the <a href="09023a.htm">Latin</a> version of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and about that <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> on chapters 13-23 of <a href="08179b.htm">Isaias</a>; in 398, an unfinished work <a href="../fathers/3004.htm">"Contra Joannem Hierosolymitanum"</a>; in 401, <a href="../fathers/2710.htm">"Apologeticum adversus Rufinum"</a>; between 403-406, <a href="../fathers/3010.htm">"Contra Vigilantium"</a>; finally from 398 to 405, completion of the version of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> according to the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>.</p>

<p>In the last period of his life, from 405 to 420, St. Jerome took up the series of his <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> interrupted for seven years. In 406, he commented on <a href="11337a.htm">Osee</a>, <a href="08419a.htm">Joel</a>, <a href="01435a.htm">Amos</a>, <a href="15741b.htm">Zacharias</a>, <a href="09562b.htm">Malachias</a>; in 408, on <a href="04620a.htm">Daniel</a>; from 408 to 410, on the remainder of <a href="08179b.htm">Isaias</a>; from 410 to 415, on <a href="05737b.htm">Ezechiel</a>; from 415-420, on <a href="08333c.htm">Jeremias</a>. From 401 to 410 date what is left of his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>; treatises on <a href="09674a.htm">St. Mark</a>, <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the <a href="12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, on various subjects, and on the <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; in 415, <a href="../fathers/3011.htm">"Dialogi contra Pelagianos"</a>.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of St. Jerome's work</h2>

<p>St. Jerome owes his place in the history of <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> studies chiefly to his <a href="15515b.htm">revisions</a> and translations of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. Until about 391-2, he considered the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> translation as inspired. But the progress of his <a href="07176a.htm">Hebraistic</a> studies and his intercourse with the <a href="12617b.htm">rabbis</a> made him give up that <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, and he recognized as <a href="08045a.htm">inspired</a> the original text only. It was about this period that he undertook the translation of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> from the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a>. But he went too far in his reaction against the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of his time, and is open to reproach for not having sufficiently appreciated the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>. This latter version was made from a much older, and at times much purer, <a href="07175a.htm">Hebrew text</a> than the one in use at the end of the fourth century. Hence the <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> of taking the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> into consideration in any attempt to restore the text of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. With this exception we must admit the excellence of the translation made by St. Jerome.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>His <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> represent a vast amount of work but of very unequal value. Very often he worked exceedingly rapidly; besides, he considered a <a href="04157a.htm">commentary</a> a work of compilation, and his chief care was to accumulate the interpretations of his predecessors, rather than to pass judgment on them. The "Quaestiones hebraicae in Genesim" is one of his best works. It is a philological inquiry concerning the original text. It is to be regretted that he was unable to continue, as had been his <a href="08069b.htm">intention</a>, a style of work entirely new at the time. Although he often asserted his desire to avoid excessive allegory, his efforts in that respect were far from successful, and in later years he was ashamed of some of his earlier allegorical explanations. He himself says that he had recourse to the allegorical meaning only when unable to discover the literal meaning. His treatise, "De Interpretatione nominum hebraicorum", is but a collection of <a href="10663b.htm">mystical</a> and <a href="14373b.htm">symbolical</a> meanings.</p>

<p>Excepting the "Commentarius in ep. ad Galatas", which is one of his best, his explanations of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> have no great value. Among his <a href="04157a.htm">commentaries</a> on the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> must be mentioned those on <a href="01435a.htm">Amos</a>, <a href="08179b.htm">Isaias</a>, and <a href="08333c.htm">Jeremias</a>. There are some that are frankly bad, for instance those on <a href="15741b.htm">Zacharias</a>, <a href="11337a.htm">Osee</a>, and <a href="08419a.htm">Joel</a>.</p>

<p>To sum up, the <a href="02543a.htm">Biblical</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of St. Jerome makes him rank first among ancient <a href="05692b.htm">exegetes</a>. In the first place, he was very careful as to the sources of his information. He required of the <a href="05692b.htm">exegete</a> a very extensive <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of sacred and profane history, and also of the linguistics and <a href="06428c.htm">geography</a> of Palestine. He never either categorically acknowledged or rejected the deuterocanonical books as part of the <a href="03267a.htm">Canon</a> of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a>, and he repeatedly made use of them. On the <a href="08045a.htm">inspiration</a>, the existence of a spiritual meaning, and the freedom of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> from <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, he holds the <a href="15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Possibly he has insisted more than others on the share which belongs to the sacred writer in his collaboration in the <a href="08045a.htm">inspired</a> work. His <a href="04491c.htm">criticism</a> is not without originality. The controversy with the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> and with the <a href="11388a.htm">Pagans</a> had long since called the attention of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> to certain difficulties in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. St. Jerome answers in various ways. Not to mention his answers to this or that difficulty, he appeals above all to the principle, that the original text of the <a href="13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> is the only one <a href="08045a.htm">inspired</a> and free from <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>. Therefore one must determine if the text, in which the difficulties arise, has not been altered by the copyist. Moreover, when the writers of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> quoted the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, they did so not according to the letter but according to the spirit. There are many subtleties and even contradictions in the explanations Jerome offers, but we must bear in <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> his evident sincerity. He does not try to cloak over his <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; he admits that there are many difficulties in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>; at times he seems quite embarrassed. Finally, he proclaims a principle, which, if recognized as legitimate, might serve to adjust the insufficiencies of his criticism. He asserts that in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> there is no material <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> due to the <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or the heedlessness of the sacred writer, but he adds: "It is usual for the sacred historian to conform himself to the generally accepted opinion of the masses in his time" (P.L., XXVI, 98; XXIV, 855).</p>

<p>Among the historical works of St. Jerome must be noted the translation and the continuation of the "Chronicon Eusebii Caesariensis", as the continuation written by him, which extends from 325 to 378, served as a model for the <a href="01531b.htm">annals</a> of the chroniclers of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; hence the defects in such works: dryness, superabundance of data of every description, lack of proportion and of historical sense. The <a href="../fathers/3008.htm">"Vita S. Pauli Eremitae"</a> is not a very reliable document. The <a href="../fathers/3006.htm">"Vita Malchi, monachi"</a> is a eulogy of <a href="03637d.htm">chastity</a> woven through a number of legendary episodes. As to the <a href="../fathers/3003.htm">"Vita S. Hilarionis"</a>, it has suffered from contact with the preceding ones. It has been asserted that the journeys of <a href="07347a.htm">St. Hilarion</a> are a plagiarism of some old tales of travel. But these objections are altogether misplaced, as it is really a reliable work. The treatise <a href="../fathers/2708.htm">"De Viris illustribus"</a> is a very excellent literary history. It was written as an <a href="01618a.htm">apologetic</a> work to <a href="12454c.htm">prove</a> that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had produced learned men. For the first three centuries Jerome depends to a great extent on <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, whose statements he borrows, often distorting them, owing to the rapidity with which he worked. His accounts of the authors of the fourth century however are of great value.</p>

<p>The oratorical consist of about one hundred <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> or short treatises, and in these the Solitary of Bethlehem appears in a new light. He is a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> addressing <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, not without making very obvious allusions to contemporary events. The orator is lengthy and apologizes for it. He displays a wonderful <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the versions and contents of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. His allegory is excessive at times, and his teaching on <a href="06689a.htm">grace</a> is <a href="13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a>. A censorious spirit against authority, sympathy for the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a> which reaches the point of hostility against the rich, lack of good taste, inferiority of style, and misquotation, such are the most glaring defects of these <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>. Evidently they are notes taken down by his hearers, and it is a question whether they were reviewed by the preacher.</p>

<p>The correspondence of St. Jerome is one of the best known parts of his literary output. It comprises about one hundred and twenty letters from him, and several from his correspondents. Many of these letters were written with a view to publication, and some of them the author even edited himself; hence they show evidence of great care and skill in their composition, and in them St. Jerome reveals himself a master of style. These letters, which had already met with great success with his contemporaries, have been, with the <a href="../fathers/1101.htm">"Confessions"</a> of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, one of the works most appreciated by the <a href="07538b.htm">humanists</a> of the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. Aside from their literary interest they have great historical value. Relating to a period covering half a century they touch upon most varied subjects; hence their division into letters dealing with <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, polemics, <a href="04491c.htm">criticism</a>, conduct, and biography. In spite of their turgid diction they are full of the man's <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>. It is in this correspondence that the temperament of St. Jerome is most clearly seen: his waywardness, his love of extremes, his exceeding sensitiveness; how he was in turn exquisitely dainty and bitterly satirical, unsparingly outspoken concerning others and equally frank about himself.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings of St. Jerome are mainly controversial works, one might almost say composed for the occasion. He missed being a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, by not applying himself in a consecutive and personal manner to <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> questions. In his controversies he was simply the interpreter of the accepted <a href="05075b.htm">ecclesiastical doctrine</a>. Compared with <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> his inferiority in breadth and originality of view is most evident.</p>

<p>His <a href="../fathers/3005.htm">"Dialogue"</a> against the Luciferians deals with a <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> whose founder was <a href="09410b.htm">Lucifer</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03139c.htm">Cagliari</a> in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. The Luciferians refused to approve of the measure of clemency by which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, since the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01300a.htm">Council of Alexandria</a>, in 362, had allowed <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who had adhered to <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, to continue to discharge their <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> on condition of professing the <a href="11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>. This rigorist <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> had adherents almost everywhere, and even in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> it was very troublesome. Against it Jerome wrote his <a href="../fathers/3005.htm">"Dialogue"</a>, scathing in sarcasm, but not always accurate in <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, particularly as to the <a href="04215b.htm">Sacrament of Confirmation</a>.</p>

<p>The book <a href="../fathers/3007.htm">"Adversus Helvidium"</a> belongs to about the same period. Helvidius held the two following tenets:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><a href="15464b.htm">Mary</a> bore children to <a href="08504a.htm">Joseph</a> after the <a href="15448a.htm">virginal birth of Jesus Christ</a>;</li><li>from a <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> viewpoint, the <a href="09707a.htm">married</a> state is not inferior to <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>.</li></ul></div>

<p>Earnest entreaty decided Jerome to answer. In doing so he discusses the various texts of the <a href="06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which, it was claimed, contained the objections to the <a href="15448a.htm">perpetual virginity of Mary</a>. If he did not find positive answers on all points, his work, nevertheless, holds a very creditable place in the history of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> upon these questions.</p>

<p>The relative dignity of <a href="15458a.htm">virginity</a> and <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a>, discussed in the book against Helvidius, was taken up again in the book <a href="../fathers/3009.htm">"Adversus Jovinianum"</a> written about ten years later. Jerome recognizes the legitimacy of <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a>, but he uses concerning it certain disparaging expressions which were criticized by contemporaries and for which he has given no satisfactory explanation. Jovinian was more dangerous than Helvidius. Although he did not exactly teach <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, and the uselessness of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, he made far too easy the road to <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> and slighted a life of <a href="01767c.htm">asceticism</a>. Every one of these points St. Jerome took up.</p>

<p>The <a href="../fathers/2710.htm">"Apologeticum adversus Rufinum"</a> dealt with the <a href="11306b.htm">Origenistic</a> controversies. St. Jerome was involved in one of the most <a href="15446a.htm">violent</a> episodes of that struggle, which agitated the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="11306b.htm">Origen's</a> lifetime until the <a href="04308b.htm">Fifth Ecumenical Council</a> (553). The question at issue was to determine if certain doctrines professed by <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> and others taught by certain <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> followers of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> could be accepted. In the present case the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> difficulties were embittered by personalities between St. Jerome and his former friend, Rufinus. To understand St. Jerome's position we must remember that the works of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> were by far the most complete <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> collection then in existence, and the one most accessible to students. Hence a very natural tendency to make use of them, and it is evident that St. Jerome did so, as well as many others. But we must carefully distinguish between writers who made use of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> and those who adhered to his doctrines. This distinction is particularly <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> with St. Jerome, whose method of work was very rapid, and consisted in transcribing the interpretations of former <a href="05692b.htm">exegetes</a> without passing criticism on them. Nevertheless, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that St. Jerome greatly praised and made use of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, that he even transcribed some <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> passages without due reservation. But it is also evident that he never adhered thinkingly and systematically to the <a href="11306b.htm">Origenistic</a> doctrines.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it came about that when Rufinus, who was a genuine <a href="11306b.htm">Origenist</a>, called on him to justify his use of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, the explanations he gave were not free from embarrassment. At this distance of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> it would require a very subtle and detailed study of the question to decide the real basis of the quarrel. However that may be, Jerome may be accused of imprudence of language and blamed for a too hasty method of work. With a <a href="11727b.htm">temperament</a> such as his, and confident of his undoubted <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in the matter of <a href="11306b.htm">Origenism</a>, he must naturally have been <a href="14504a.htm">tempted</a> to justify anything. This brought about a most bitter controversy with his wily adversary, Rufinus. But on the whole Jerome's position is by far the stronger of the two, even in the eyes of his contemporaries. It is generally conceded that in this controversy Rufinus was to blame. It was he who brought about the conflict in which he <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> himself to be narrow-minded, perplexed, <a href="01381d.htm">ambitious</a>, even timorous. St. Jerome, whose attitude is not always above reproach, is far superior to him.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Vigilantius, the Gascon <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> against whom Jerome wrote a treatise, quarrelled with ecclesiastical usages rather than matters of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. What he principally rejected was the <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> life and the <a href="05188b.htm">veneration</a> of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>.</p>

<p>In short, Helvidius, Jovinian, and Vigilantius were the mouthpieces of a reaction against <a href="01767c.htm">asceticism</a> which had developed so largely in the fourth century. Perhaps the influence of that same reaction is to be seen in the doctrine of the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, who gave his name to the principal <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> on <a href="06689a.htm">grace</a>: <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. On this subject Jerome wrote his "Dialogi contra Pelagianos". Accurate as to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>, the author is much less so when he determines the part of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> in the act of <a href="08573a.htm">justification</a>. In the main his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> are <a href="13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a>: <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="10202b.htm">merits</a> first <a href="06689a.htm">grace</a>: a formula which endangers the absolute freedom of the <a href="06689a.htm">gift of grace</a>.</p>

<p>The book "De situ et nominibus locorum hebraicorum" is a translation of the "Onomasticon" of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, to which the translator has joined additions and corrections. The translations of the "Homilies" of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> vary in character according to the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> in which they were written. As <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> went on, Jerome became more expert in the art of translating, and he outgrew the tendency to palliate, as he came across them, certain <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>. We must make special mention of the translation of the <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> "In Canticum Canticorum", the Greek original of which has been lost.</p>

<p>St. Jerome's complete works can be found in P.L., XXII-XXX.</p>
