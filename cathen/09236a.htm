<p>(The Diocese of Li&egrave;ge; <em>canonical name</em> L<font size=-2>EODIENSIS</font>).</p>

<p>Li&egrave;ge (V<font size=-2>ICUS</font> L<font size=-2>EUDICUS</font>; L<font size=-2>EODIUM</font>; L<font size=-2>EGIA</font>) is now [1910] the capital of a <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> province of the same name.</p>

<p>The first capital of this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was Tongres, northeast of Li&egrave;ge; its territory originally belonged to the <a href="15042a.htm">Diocese of Trier</a>, then to Cologne; but after the first half of the fourth century Tongres received autonomous organization. The boundaries were those of the <em>Civitas Tungrorum</em>, and they remained unchanged until 1559. These boundaries were, on the north, the <a href="15245a.htm">Diocese of Utrecht</a>; east, that of Cologne; south, the Dioceses of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> and <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>; west, that of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. Thus Tongres extended from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, in the neighbourhood of Chimay, to Stavelot, <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, Gladbach, and Venlo, and from the banks of the Semois as far as Eeckeren, near <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, to the middle of the Isle of Tholen and beyond Moerdyck, so that it included both Latin and Germanic populations. In 1559, its 1636 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were grouped in eight archdeaconries, and twenty-eight councils, <em>chr&eacute;tient&eacute;s</em>, or deaneries.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Some trace the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Tongres to the first century, but the first Bishop was St. Servais, installed in 344 or 345 assisted at the <a href="13057b.htm">Council of Rimini</a> (359-60), and died in 384 (?). The invasion of 406 shattered the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and its restoration required a long time. The conversion of the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a> began under Falco (first half of the sixth century) and continued under Sts. Domitian, Monulphus, and Gondulphus (sixth and seventh centuries). St. Monulphus built over the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Servais a sumptuous church, near which his successors often resided. During the whole of the seventh century the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had to struggle against <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>. <a href="01380b.htm">St. Amandus</a> (647-50) abandoned the episcopal chair in discouragement, and built <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. St. Remaculus (650-60) did the same. <a href="14568b.htm">St. Theodard</a> (660-69), died a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>.</p>

<p>St. Lambert (669-705?) completed the conversion of the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>; probably about 705 he was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Vicus Leudicus, for his defence of <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a> against the <a href="02148b.htm">avarice</a> of the neighbouring lords, and he was popularly regarded as a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>. His successor, <a href="07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a>, built, to enshrine his <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>, a <a href="02325a.htm">basilica</a> which became the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> nucleus of the city, and near which the residence of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> was fixed.</p>

<p>Those <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, nevertheless, continued to use the style of <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Tongres, or <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tongres and of Li&egrave;ge. Agilbert (768-84), and Gerbald (785-810) were both placed in the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> by <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. Hartgar built the first episcopal palace. Bishop Franco, who defeated the Normans, is celebrated by the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> poet Sedulius. Stephen (908-20), Richaire (920-45), Hugh (945-47), Farabert (947-58) and Rathier were promoted from the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a>. To Stephen, a writer and composer, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is indebted for the feast and the Office of the <a href="15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>. Rathier absorbed all the learning of his time. Heraclius, who occupied the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> in 959, built four new <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and two collegiate churches, he inaugurated in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> an era of great artistic activity.</p>

<p>The domain of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Li&egrave;ge had been developed by the donations of sovereign princes and the acquisitions of its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Notger (972-1008), by securing for his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> authority of a countship became himself a sovereign prince. This status his successors retained until the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>: and throughout that period of nearly eight centuries the Prince-Bishopric of Li&egrave;ge, with a temporal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of less extent than its spiritual, succeeded in maintaining its autonomy, though theoretically attached to the Empire. This virtual independence it owed largely to the ability of its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, under whom the Principality of Li&egrave;ge, placed between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, on several occasions played an important part in international politics. Notger, the founder of this principality, was also the second founder of his episcopal city. He rebuilt the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a> and the episcopal palace, finished the collegiate <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Paul, begun by Heraclius, facilitated the erection of Sainte-Croix and Saint-Denis, two other collegiate churches, and erected that of <a href="08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>. This <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> also strengthened the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> organization of the city. He was one of the first to spread the observance of <a href="01315b.htm">All Souls' Day</a>, which he authorized for his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. But the most notable characteristic of Notger's administration was the development which, following up the work of Heraclius, he gave to <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>: thanks to these two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and to Wazo, "Li&egrave;ge for more than a century occupied among the nations a position in regard to <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> which it has never recovered". "The <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of Li&egrave;ge were, in fact, at that time one of the brightest literary foci of the period". Balderic of Looz (1008-18), Walbodon (1018-21), Durandus (1021-25), Reginard (1025-38), Nitard (1038-42), the learned Wazo, and Theoduin (1048-75) valiantly sustained the heritage of Notger. The <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> went on forming many brilliant scholars, and gave to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> Popes <a href="14290c.htm">Stephen IX</a> and <a href="11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the reign of Henry of <a href="15350c.htm">Verdun</a> (1075-91) a tribunal was instituted (<em>tribunal de la paix</em>) to take cognizance of infractions of the Peace of God. Otbert (1091-1119) increased the territory of the principality. He remained faithful to <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>, who died as his guest. The violent death of Henry of <a href="10679a.htm">Namur</a> (1119-21) won for him veneration as a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Alexander of Juliers (1128-34) received at Li&egrave;ge the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, the emperor, and <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>. The episcopate of Raoul of Zachringen was marked by the preaching of the reformer, Lambert le B&egrave;gue, who is credited with founding the <em>b&eacute;guines</em>. The time at length came when the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of Li&egrave;ge were to yield to the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and the diocese supplied that <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> with some of its first <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> &mdash; William of Saint-Thierry, Gerard of Li&egrave;ge, <a href="06626a.htm">Godfrey of Fontaines</a>.</p>

<p>Albert of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> was elected <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Li&egrave;ge in 1191, but <a href="07233a.htm">Emperor Henry VI</a>, on the pretext that the election was <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, gave the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> to Lothair of Hochstadt. Albert's election was confirmed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, but was assassinated at <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, in 1192, by three German <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>. It is probable that the emperor was privy to this <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a>, the victim of which was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a>. In 1195 Albert de Cuyck (1195-1200) formally recognized the franchises of the people of Li&egrave;ge. In the twelfth century the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter assumed a position of importance in relation to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and began to play an important part in history of the principality.</p>

<p>The struggles between the upper and lower classes, in which the prince-bishops frequently intervened, developed through the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, to culminate, in the fifteenth, with the pillage and destruction of the episcopal city. In the reign of Robert of Thourotte, or of <a href="08789c.htm">Langres</a> (1240-46), <a href="08556c.htm">St. Juliana</a> &mdash; a religious of Cornillon, Li&egrave;ge &mdash; was led by certain visions to the project of having a special feast established in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. After much hesitation, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> approved of her <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> and caused a special office to be composed, but death prevented his instituting the feast. The completion of the work was reserved for a former <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of Li&egrave;ge, Hugh of Saint-Cher, who returned to the city as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. Hugh, in 1252, made the feast one of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> throughout his legatine <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. John of <a href="15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, who, after having been <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> at Li&egrave;ge, was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>, caused an office to be composed by <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and extended the observance of the feast of <a href="04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> to the whole Church. Another <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Li&egrave;ge, becoming <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, deposed the unworthy Henry of Gueldres (1247-74). The Peace of Fexhe, signed in 1316, in the reign of Adolph of La Marck (1313-44), regulated the relations of the prince <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his subjects; nevertheless the intestinal discord continued, and the episcopate of Arnould of Hornes (1378-89) was marked by the triumph of the popular party. Louis of Bourbon (1456-82) was placed on the throne by the political machinations of the dukes of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, who coveted the principality. The destruction of Dinant, in 1466, and of Li&egrave;ge, in 1468, by Charles the Bold, marked the ending of democratic ascendancy.</p>

<p>Erard de la Marck brought a period of restoration; he was an enlightened protector of the arts. He it was who commenced that struggle against the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> which his successors maintained after him, and in which Gerard of Groesbeeck (1564-80) was especially distinguished. With the object of assisting in this struggle, <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Super Universi" (12 May, 1550), created the new <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of the Low Countries. This change was effected largely at the expense of the Diocese of Li&egrave;ge; many of its <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were taken from it to form the entire Dioceses of Ruremonde, Bois-le-Duc (Hertogenboseh), and Namur, as well as, in part, those of <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> and <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. The number of deaneries in the Diocese of Li&egrave;ge was reduced to thirteen.</p>

<p>Most of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the seventeenth century were foreigners, many of them holding several <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> at once. Their frequent absences gave free scope for those feuds of the Chiroux and the Grignoux to which Maximilian llenr of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1650-88) put a stop by the Edict of 1681. In the middle of the eighteenth century the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the French <em>encyclop&eacute;distes</em> began to be received at Li&egrave;ge; Bishop de Velbruck (1772-84), encouraged their propagation and thus prepared the way for the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, which burst upon the episcopal city on 18 August, 1789, during the reign of Bishop de Hoensbroech (1781-92). At last the territory of the principality was united to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and thenceforward shared the destines of the other <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> provinces. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, too, disappeared in the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>.</p>

<p>The new diocese, erected 10 April, 1802, included the two Departments of Ourte and Meuse-Inf&eacute;rieure, with certain <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the Forest districts. In 1818 it lost a certain number of cantons, ceded to <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. After the establishment of the Kingdom of the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> the diocese comprised the Provinces of Li&egrave;ge and <a href="09260a.htm">Limburg</a>. On 6 May, 1538. <a href="02645a.htm">Mgr Van Bommel</a> divided the Province of Li&egrave;ge into two deaneries. In 1839 the diocese lost those <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> which were situated in <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Limburg. The present Diocese of Li&egrave;ge, suffragan to <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, consists of 670 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, grouped in 40 deaneries, and has (1909) a population of 1,152,151, the majority (Walloons) speaking French; the minority, <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a> or German. Diocesan statistics (1909): deaneries, 40; curacies, 44; succursal <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 620; <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 30; vicariates paid by the State, 307; annexes, 22. After the <a href="04204a.htm">Concordat</a>, the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was governed by Zaepffel (1802-08); after him, Lejeas, nominated in 1809 by <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, failed to obtain <a href="08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>, and the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered successively by the two vicars-capitular, Henrard (1808-14) and Barrett (1814-29). The succeeding <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been: <a href="02645a.htm">Corneille Van Bommel</a> (1829-52), Th&eacute;odore de Montpellier (1852-79), Victor Joseph Doutreloux (1879-1901). Mgr Martin-Hubert Rutten, the present <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was instituted in 1901. On account of the Law of Separation, a number of French <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities have settled in the diocese.</p>
