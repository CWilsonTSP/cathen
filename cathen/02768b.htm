<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p>This word <em>breviary</em> (<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Breviarium</em>), signifies in its primary acceptation an abridgment, or a compendium. It is often employed in this sense by <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> authors, e.g. <em>Breviarium fidei, Breviarium in psalmos, Breviarium canonum, Breviarium regularum.</em> In liturgical language Breviary has a special meaning, indicating a book furnishing the regulations for the celebration of Mass or the canonical Office, and may be met with under the titles <em>Breviarium Ecclesiastici Ordinis</em>, or <em>Breviarium Ecclesi&aelig; Romins&aelig; (Roman&aelig;).</em> In the ninth century <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> uses the word to designate an office abridged or simplified for the use of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>. Prudentius of <a href="15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, about the same period, composed a <em>Breviarium Psalterii</em> (v. inf. V. HISTORY). In an ancient inventory occurs <em>Breviarium Antiphonarii</em>, meaning "Extracts from the Antiphonary". In the "Vita Aldrici" occurs "sicut in plenariis et breviariis Ecclesi&aelig; ejusdem continentur". Again, in the inventories in the catalogues, such notes as these may be met with: "Sunt et duo cursinarii et tres benedictionales Libri; ex his unus habet obsequium mortuorum et unus Breviarius", or, "Pr&aelig;ter Breviarium quoddam quod usque ad festivitatem S. Joannis Baptist&aelig; retinebunt", etc. <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> about A.D. 1100 obtained a book entitled "Incipit Breviarium sive Ordo Officiorum per totam anni decursionem".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From such references, and from others of a like nature, <a href="12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> gathers that by the word <em>Breviarium</em> was at first designated a book furnishing the <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, a sort of <em>Ordo.</em> The title <em>Breviary</em>, as we employ it &#151; that is, a book containing the entire canonical office &#151; appears to date from the eleventh century.</p>

<p><a href="06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a> having, indeed, abridged the order of <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and having simplified the Liturgy as performed at the Roman Court, this abridgment received the name of <em>Breviary</em>, which was suitable, since, according to the etymology of the word, it was an abridgment. The name has been extended to books which contain in one volume, or at least in one work, <a href="09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of different kinds, such as the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, the Antiphonary, the Responsoriary, the Lectionary, etc. In this connection it may be pointed out that in this sense the word, as it is used nowadays, is illogical; it should be named a <em>Plenarium</em> rather than a <em>Breviarium</em>, since, liturgically speaking, the word <em>Plenarium</em> exactly designates such books as contain several different compilations united under one cover. This is pointed out, however, simply to make still clearer the meaning and origin of the word; and section V will furnish a more detailed explanation of the formation of the Breviary.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Contents</h2>

<p>The <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, which with rare exceptions (certain <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, the Ambrosian and Mozarabic Rites, etc.) is used at this day throughout the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, is divided into four parts according to the seasons of the year: Winter, Spring, Summer, and Autumn. It is constructed of the following elements: (a) the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>; (b) the Proper of the Season; (c) Proper of the Saints; (d) the Common; (e) certain special Offices.</p>

<h3 id="A">The Psalter</h3>

<p>The <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is the most ancient and the most venerable portion of the Breviary. It consists of 150 psalms, divided in a particular way, to be described later. These psalms formed the groundwork of the Liturgy of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> for twelve centuries before <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and He certainly made use of these formularies for His <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and quoted them on several occasions. The Apostles followed His example, and handed down to the <a href="03744a.htm">Christian Churches</a> the inheritance of the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> as the chief form of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has carefully preserved them during the lapse of centuries and has never sought to replace them by any other formularies. Attempts have been made from time to time to compose <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> psalms, such as the <em>Gloria in excelsis</em>, the <em>Te Deum</em>, the <em>Lumen Hilare</em>, the <em>Te Decet Laus</em>, and a few others; but those which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has retained and adopted are singularly few in number. The rhythmic <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> date from a period later than the fourth and fifth centuries, and at best hold a purely secondary place in the scheme of the Office. Thus the Book of Psalms forms the groundwork of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>; the lessons which fill so important a place in this <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> are not, after all, <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> properly so called; and the <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, responsories, versicles, etc., are but psalms utilized in a particular manner.</p>

<p>In the Breviary, however, the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is divided according to a special plan. In the earliest period the use of the Book of Psalms in the Office was doubtless exactly similar to that which prevailed amongst the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The president of the choir chose a particular psalm at his own will. Some psalms, such as xxi, seem specially appropriate to the Passion. Another was adapted to the <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, a third suited the <a href="01767b.htm">Ascension</a>, while others again are specially referable to the <a href="11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>. Some psalms provide morning <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, others those for night. But the choice was left in the hands of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or president of the choir. Later, probably from the fourth century, certain psalms began to be grouped together, to respond to the divers requirements of the Liturgy.</p>

<p>Another cause led to these groupings and arrangements of the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. Some <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were in the habit of reciting daily the whole of the 150 psalms. But this form of devotion, apart from lessons and other formularies, occupied so much time that they began to spread the recitation of the entire <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> over a whole week. By this method each day was divided into hours, and each hour had its own portion of the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. From this arrangement arose the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of dividing the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> according to specially devised rules. St. Benedict was one of the earliest to set himself to this task, in the sixth century. In his Rule he gives minute directions how, at that period, the psalms were to be distributed at the disposition of the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>; and he himself drew up such an arrangement. Certain psalms were set apart for the night offices, others for <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, others for Prime, <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, and None, others for <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> and <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It is a subject of discussion amongst <a href="09306a.htm">liturgists</a> whether this <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> division of the psalms is anterior or posterior to the Roman <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. Although it may not be possible to prove the point definitely, still it would seem that the Roman arrangement is the older of the two, because that drawn up by St. Benedict shows more skill, and would thus seem to be in the nature of a reform of the Roman division. In any case, the Roman arrangement of the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> reaches back to a hoary antiquity, at least to the seventh or eighth century, since when it has not undergone any alteration. The following is its disposition. Psalms i-cviii are recited at <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a>, twelve a day; but Sunday <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a> have six more psalms divided between the three nocturns. Thus:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Sunday &#151; Psalms i, ii, iii, vi-xiv; xv, xvi, xvii; xviii, xix, xx.</li><li>Monday &#151; Psalms xxvi-xxxvii.</li><li>Tuesday &#151; Psalms xxxviii-xli, xliii-xlix, li.</li><li>Wednesday &#151; Psalms lii, liv-lxi, lxiii, lxv, lxvii.</li><li>Thursday &#151; Psalms lxviii-lxxix.</li><li>Friday &#151; Psalms lxxx-lxxxviii, xciii, xcv, xcvi.</li><li>Saturday &#151; Psalms xcvii-cviii.</li></ul></div>

<p>The psalms omitted in this series, namely, iv, v, xxi-xxv, xlii, l, liii, lxii, lxiv, lxvi, lxxix-xcii, and xciv, are, on account of their special aptitude, reserved for <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, Prime, and <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a>.</p>

<p>The series, from <a href="../bible/psa109.htm">Psalm 109</a> to <a href="../bible/psa147.htm">Psalm 147</a> inclusively, are used at <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, five each day, except <a href="../bible/psa117.htm">Psalms 117</a>, <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">118</a> and <a href="../bible/psa142.htm">142</a>, reserved for other hours. The last three, cxlviii, cxlix, and cl, which are specially called the psalms of praise (Laudes), because of the word Laudate which forms their leitmotiv, are always used in the morning Office, which thus gets its name of <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a>.</p>

<p>A glance at the above tables will show that, broadly speaking, the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> did not attempt to make any skilful selection of the psalms for daily recitation. She took them in order as they came, except a very few set apart for <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, Prime, and <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a>, and selected <a href="../bible/psa118.htm">Psalm 118</a> for the day hours. Other Liturgies, as the Ambrosian, the Mozarabic, and the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, or monastic, have <a href="12543b.htm">Psalters</a> drawn up on wholly different lines; but the respective merits of these systems need not be here discussed. The order of the <a href="06043a.htm">ferial</a> <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is not followed for the festivals of the year or for the feasts of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>; but the psalms are selected according to their suitableness to the various occasions.</p>

<p>The history of the text of this <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is interesting. The most ancient <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> used in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was the "Psalterium Vetus", of the Itala version, which seems to have been introduced into the Liturgy by <a href="04613a.htm">Pope St. Damasus</a> (d. 384). He it was who first ordered the revision of the Itala by <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, in A.D. 383. On this account it has been called the "Psalterium Romanum", and it was used in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and elsewhere till the ninth century and later. It is still in use in St. Peter's at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and many of the texts of our Breviary and <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> still show some variants (Invitatory an Ps. xciv, the <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> of the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> and the responsories of the Proper of the Season, <a href="08081a.htm">Introits</a>, Graduals, Offertories, and Communions). The Roman <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> also influences the Mozarabic Liturgy, and was used in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in the eighth century. But in <a href="06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and in other countries north of the Alps, another recension entered into competition with the "Psalterium Romanum" under the somewhat misleading title of the "Psalterium Gallicanum"; for this text contained nothing distinctively <a href="06357a.htm">Gallican</a>, being simply a later correction of the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> made by <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> in Palestine, in A.D. 392. This recension diverged more completely than the earlier one form the Itala; and in preparing it <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> had laid <a href="11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <a href="07316a.htm">Hexapla</a> under contribution. It would seem that <a href="07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, in the sixth century, introduced this translation into Gaul, or at any rate he was specially instrumental in spreading its use; for it was this <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> that was employed in the Divine psalmody celebrated at the much <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> and frequented <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>. From that time this text commenced its "triumphal march across <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>". Walafrid Starbo states that the churches of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> were using it in the eighth century: &#151; "Galli et Germanorum aliqui secundum emendationem quam Hieronymus pater de LXX composuit Psalterium cantant". About the same time <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> gave up the "Psalterium Romanum" for the "Gallicanum". The Anglo-Saxon <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> already referred to was corrected and altered in the ninth and tenth century, to make it accord with the "Gallicanum". <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> seems to have followed the <a href="06357a.htm">Gallican</a> version since the seventh century, as may be gathered from the famous Antiphonary of Bangor. It even penetrated into <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> after the ninth century, thanks to the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> influence, and there enjoyed a considerable vogue. After the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, <a href="12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> extended the use of the "Psalterium Gallicanum" to the whole Church, St. Peter's in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> alone still keeping to the ancient Roman <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. The Ambrosian Church of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> has also its own recension of the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, a version founded, in the middle of the fourth century, on the Greek.</p>

<h3 id="B">The Proper of season</h3>

<p>This portion of the Breviary contains the Office of the different <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> seasons. As is well known, these periods are now thus arranged: <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a>, <a href="03724b.htm">Christmastide</a>, <a href="13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>, <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>, <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, <a href="11516a.htm">paschal time</a>, and the time after Pentecost. But only by slow degrees did this division of the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year develop its present form. It must be traced through its various stages. It may indeed be said that originally there was no such thing as a <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year. Sunday, the day above all of the Eucharistic celebration, is at once the commemoration of the Passion, Death, and <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> of Jesus Christ; men spoke of the "Pasch of the Crucifixion", of the "Pasch of the Resurrection" &#151; <em>pascha staurosimon; pascha anastasimon</em>; every <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> was a renewal of the paschal festival. It was only natural that on the actual anniversary the feast should be kept with peculiar solemnity, for it was the foremost <a href="06021b.htm">Christian feast</a>, and the centre of the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year. <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> drew in it is train Pentecost, which was fixed as the fiftieth day after the <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>; it was the festival commemorating the Descent of the Holy Ghost on the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. These fifty days made up an unbroken festival, a Jubilee, a time of <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> during which there was no <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> and when penitential exercises were suspended. These two feasts thus linked together are mentioned by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers from the second century onwards.</p>

<p>Just as <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> was followed by fifty days of rejoicing, so it had its period of preparation by <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, from which arose the <a href="09152a.htm">season of Lent</a>, which, after various changes, commenced finally forty days before <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, whence its name of <em><a href="12589a.htm">Quadragesima</a>.</em> The other rallying-point of the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year is the <a href="03724b.htm">feast of Christmas</a>, the earliest observance of which is of very remote antiquity (the third century at least). Like <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a> had its time of preparation, called <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a>. Lasting nowadays four weeks. The remainder of the year had to fit in between these two feasts. From <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a> to <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> two currents may be observed : into one fell the feasts of the Epiphany and the Purification, and six <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after the Epiphany, constituting <a href="03724b.htm">Christmastide</a>. The remaining weeks after these <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> fall under the influence of <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> and, under the name of <a href="13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>, create a sort of introduction to it, since these three weeks, <a href="13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>, <a href="13747a.htm">Sexagesima</a>, and <a href="12614a.htm">Quinquagesima</a>, really belong to <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> by reason of their character of preparation and penance.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The long period between Pentecost and <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a>, from May to December, still remains to be dealt with. A certain number of <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> cluster round special great festivals, as those of <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> (24 June), the holy Apostles Peter and Paul (29 June), <a href="09089a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> (10 August), and <a href="10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> (29 September). At later date these days, which did not fit very conveniently into the general scheme, tended to disappear, and were absorbed into the common time after Pentecost, made up of twenty-four <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, thereby uniting Pentecost with <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a>; and thus the cycle of the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> year is completed.</p>

<p>The Proper of the Season contains, therefore, the Office of all the <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and festivals belonging to it, with special lessons, extracts from the Gospels, and frequently also proper <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, responsories, and psalms, adapted to the peculiar character of these different periods. It is in the composition of this Liturgy that the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> has displayed her gifts of critical judgment, <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> taste, and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> acumen. The difference in the character of these periods may be studied in such works as <a href="07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger's</a> "Liturgical Year".</p>

<h3 id="C">Proper of the saints</h3>

<p>Following on the Proper of the Season comes in the Breviary the Proper of the Saints, that is to say, that part which contains the lessons, psalms, <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, and other <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> formularies for the feasts of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. In reality this Proper commemorates a very large number of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> who find mention in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Calendar; this, however, meed not be given here, as it can easily be consulted. But it may be noted that the greater number of the days of the year &#151; at least nine-tenths &#151; are appropriated to special feasts; and the question has therefore been seriously debated, every time a movement for the reform of the Breviary has arisen, as to how to save the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> from being overwhelmed by these feasts, and as to how to restore to the <a href="06043a.htm">ferial</a> Office its rightful ascendancy. This is not the place for the discussion of such a problem; but it may be said that this invasion of the Proper of the Season has reached such proportions imperceptibly. It was not always thus; in the beginning, up to the seventh, and even up to ninth, century, the feasts of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> observed in the Breviary were not numerous, as may be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by comparing modern Calendars with such ancient ones as may be seen in "An Ancient Syrian Martyrology", "Le calendrier de Philocalus", "Martyrologium Hieronymianum", "Kalendarium Carthaginense". These Calendars contain little more than the following list, beyond the great festivals of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Exaltation of Holy Cross &#151; 14 September.</li><li>Presentation of Jesus, or Purification of B.V.M. &#151; 2 or 15 February.</li><li>Dormitio, or Assumption, B.V.M. &#151; 15 August.</li><li>St. Michael, Archangel &#151; 29 September.</li><li>Sts.

<h3 id="D">The common</h3>

<p>Under this designation come all the lessons, Gospels, <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, responsories, and versicles which are not reserved to a special occasion, but may be employed for a whole group of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. These Commons are those of Apostles, <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, Martyrs, Confessors Pontiffs, Confessors non-Pontiffs, Abbots, Virgins, and Holy Women. To these may be added the Offices of the Dedication of the Churches, and of the Blessed Virgin. The <a href="11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a> occupies a place apart. It is most difficult to fix the origin of these Offices. The most ancient seem to belong to the ninth, the eighth, and even the seventh century, and through special formularies may even date still further back. To give one example, the <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> of the Common of Martyrs in <a href="11516a.htm">paschal time</a>, "Sancti tui, Domine, florebunt sicut lilium, et sicut odor balsami erunt ante te", "Lux perpetua lucebit sanctis tuis, Domine et Aeternitas temporum", are taken from the Fourth Book of Esdras (<a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>), which was rejected almost everywhere about the end of the fourth century; these verses, therefore, must probably have been borrowed at a period anterior to that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>. Probably, also, in the very beginning, the most ancient of these Common Offices were Proper Offices, and in some of them special features supporting this supposition may be noticed. Thus, the Common of Apostles is apparently referable to the Office of Sts. Peter and Paul and must bave been adapted later for all the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Such versicles as the following in the Common of Martyrs: "Volo, Pater, ut ubi ego sum, illic sit et minister meus", "Si quis mihi ministraverit, honorificabit illum Pater meus", seem to point to a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>-deacon (<em>diakonos</em>, minister), and may perhaps specially refer to <a href="09089a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, on account of the allusion to the words of his Acts: "Quo, sacerdos sancte, sine ministro properas?" Also, the numerous allusions to a crown or a palm in these same <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> refer without <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> to the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Stephen, Lawrence, and Vincent, whose names are synonyms for the crown and laurel of victory. The details <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of this hypothesis could only be given in a fuller treatise than this; suffice it to say that from the literary standpoint, as from that of arch&aelig;ology or liturgy, these Offices of the Common contain gems of great artistic beauty, and are of very great interest.</p>

<h3 id="E">Special offices</h3>

<p>The Office of the Blessed Virgin, also very ancient in some of its parts, is of great dogmatic importance; but students of this subject are referred to the <a href="14466a.htm">Rev. E.L. Taunton's</a> "The Little Office of Our Lady".</p>

<p>The Office of Dead is, without a shadow of <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>, one of the most venerable and ancient portions of the Breviary, and deserves a lengthy study to itself. The Breviaries also contain Offices proper to each <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and certain special Offices of modern origin, which, consequently, need not here detain us.</p>

<h2 id="section3">The hours</h2>

<p>The <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the Breviary is meant to be used daily; each day has its own Office; in fact it would be correct to say that each hour of the day has its own office, for, liturgically, the day is divided into hours founded on the ancient Roman divisions of the day, of three hours apiece &#151; Prime, <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, None, and <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, and the night Vigils. In conformity with this arrangement, the Office is portioned out into the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the night vigils, that is to say <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a>. <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a> itself is subdivided into three nocturns, to correspond with the three watches of the night: nine o'clock at night, midnight, and three o'clock in the morning. The office of <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a> was supposed to be recited at dawn. The day offices corresponded more or less to the following hours: Prime to 6 A.M., <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a> to 9 A.M., Sext to midday, None to 3 P.M., <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> to 6 P.M. It is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to note the words <em>more or less</em>, for these hours were regulated by the solar system, and therefore the length of the periods varied with the season.</p>

<p>The office of <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a>, which falls somewhat outside the above division, and whose origin dates later than the general arrangement, was recited at nightfall. Nor does this division of the hours go back to the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> period. So far as can be ascertained, there was no other public or official <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the earliest days, outside the Eucharistic service, except the night watches, or vigils, which consisted of the chanting of psalms and of readings from <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, the Law, and the Prophets, the Gospels and Epistles, and a <a href="07448a.htm">homily</a>. The offices of <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a> thus represent, most probably, these watches. It would seem that beyond this there was nothing but private <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and at the dawn of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> were said in the Temple, as we read in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>. The hours equivalent to <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, None, and <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> were already known to the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> as times of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and were merely adopted by the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. At first meant for private <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, they became in time the hours of public <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, especially when the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was enriched with ascetics, virgins, and <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, by their vocation <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. From that time, i.e. from the end of the third century, the monastic <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> exercised a preponderant influence on the arrangement and formation of the canonical Office. It is possible to give a fairly exact account of the establishment of these Offices in the second half of the fourth century by means of a document of surpassing importance for the history we are now considering: the "Peregrinatio ad Loca Sancta", written about A.D. 388, by Etheria, a <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>. This narrative is specifically a description of the Liturgy followed in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>.</p>

<p>The Offices of Prime and <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a> were devised later, Prime at the end of the fourth century, while <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a> is usually attributed to St. Benedict in the sixth century; but it must be acknowledged that, although he may have given it its special form for the West, there existed before his time a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the close of the day corresponding to it.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Component parts of the office</h2>

<p>Each of the hours of the Office in the Roman Liturgy is composed of the same elements: psalms (and now and then canticles), <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, responsories, <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, lessons, versicles, little chapters, and collects (<a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>).</p>

<p>A few words must be said about each of these elements from the particular point of view of the Breviary.</p>

<h3 id="A">Psalms and canticles</h3>

<p>Nothing need here be added to what has already been said in section II concerning the psalms, except that they are used in the Breviary sometimes in order of sequence, as in the <a href="06043a.htm">ferial</a> Offices of <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, sometimes by special selection, independently of the order of the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, as in <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, Prime, <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a>, and, in general, in the Offices of the Saints and other feasts. Another point of notice in the composition of the Roman Office is that it allows of the inclusion of a certain number of canticles, or songs, drawn from other portions of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a> than the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, but put on the same footing as the psalms. These are: the Canticle of Moses after the passage of the <a href="12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> (<a href="../bible/exo015.htm">Exodus 15</a>); the Canticle of Moses before his death (<a href="../bible/deu032.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>); the Prayer of Anne the mother of Samuel (<a href="../bible/1sa002.htm">1 Samuel 2</a>); the <a href="12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of Jonas (<a href="../bible/jon002.htm">Jonah 2</a>); the Canticle of Habacuc (Habacuc, iii); the Canticle of Ezechias (<a href="../bible/isa038.htm">Isaiah 38</a>); The Benedicite (<a href="../bible/dan003.htm#vrs52">Daniel 3:52</a>); lastly, the three canticles drawn from the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: the Magnificat, the Benedictus, and the Nunc dimittis.</p>

<p>This list of canticles coincides more or less with those used in the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek church</a>. St. Benedict admits these canticles into his <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, specifically stating that he borrows them from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and thus providing a further argument for the priority of the Roman Office over the monastic.</p>

<h3 id="B">Antiphons</h3>

<p>The <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> which are read nowadays in the Breviary are abridged formularies which almost always serve to introduce a psalm or canticle. They consist sometimes of a verse taken from a psalm, sometimes of a sentence selected from the Gospels or <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, e.g. "Euge, serve bone, in modico fidelis, intra in gaudium Domini tui"; occasionally they consist of phrases not culled from the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, but modelled on its style, i.e. they are the invention of a <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> author, for example: "Veni, Sponsa Christi, accipe coronam, quam tibi Dominus pr&aelig;paravit in &aelig;ternum". Originally, the meaning of the word, and the function fulfilled by the antiphon, was not what it is now. Although it is difficult to determine precisely the origin and purport of the term, it seems that it is derived from <em>antiphona</em> (<em>antiphone</em>) or from the adjective <em>antiphonos</em>, and that it signified a chant by alternate choirs. The singers or the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> were divided into two choirs; the first choir intoned the first verse of a psalm, the second continued with the second verse, the first followed with the third verse, and so on to the end of the psalm. The <em>antiphoned</em> chant is thus recitation by two choirs alternately. This term has given rise to technical discussions which cannot here be entered into.</p>

<h3 id="C">Responsory</h3>

<p>Responsory, whose composition is almost the same as that of the antiphon &#151; verse of a psalm, sentence out of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> or of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authorship &#151; nevertheless differs from it entirely as to the nature of its use in recitation or chant. The <a href="12372a.htm">precentor</a> sang or recited a psalm; the choir or the faithful replied, or repeated either one of the verses or simply the last words of the <a href="12372a.htm">precentor</a>. This form, like the antiphon, had already been in use amongst the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and appears even in the construction of certain psalms, as in cxxxv, "Laudate Dominum quoniam bonus", where the refrain, "Quoniam in &aelig;ternum misericordia ejus", which recurs in each verse, certainly corresponds to a <a href="12787a.htm">responsory</a>.</p>

<h3 id="D">Hymns</h3>

<p>The term <em><a href="07595a.htm">hymn</a></em> has a less definite meaning than those of <em>antiphon</em> or <em>responsory</em>, and in the primitive <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a> its use is somewhat uncertain. In the <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, at each hour either of the day or of the night there is a little poem in verses of different measures, usually very short. This is the <a href="07595a.htm">hymn</a>. These compositions were originally very numerous. Traces of <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> may be discerned in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, e.g., in <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a>. In the fourth and fifth centuries <a href="07596a.htm">hymnology</a> received a great impetus. Prudentius, Synesius, <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, St. Hilary, and <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> composed a great many. But it was above all in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> that this style of composition most developed, and collections of them were made, filling several volumes. The <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> contains but a moderate number of <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, forming a real anthology. Some of them are masterpieces of art. It was at a comparatively late date (about the twelfth century) that the Roman Liturgy admitted <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> into its Breviary. In its primitive austerity it had hitherto rejected them, without, however, condemning their employment in other <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3 id="E">Lessons</h3>

<p>By this term is meant the choice of readings or of extracts in the Breviary, taken either from <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a> or from the Acts of the Saints, or from the <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>. Their use is in accordance with the ancient Jewish custom, which, in the services of the <a href="14379b.htm">Synagogues</a>, enjoined that after the chanting of psalms, the Law and the Prophets should be read. The primitive Church partly adopted this service of the <a href="14379b.htm">Synagogue</a>, and thus brought into being the service of the night watches. But the course of readings was altered; after a lesson from the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the Epistles of the Apostles or their Acts or the Gospels were read. Some Churches somewhat extended this usage; for it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that the letters of <a href="04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a>, of St. Ignatius, and of Barnabas, and the "Pastor" of Hermas were read. Some Churches, indeed, less well instructed, allowed books not wholly <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, like the Gospel of Peter, to be read. In time lists were made out to fix what books might be read. Muratori's "Canon" and, still better, the "Decrees of Gelasius" may be studied from this point of view with profit. Later on men were not content to confine themselves to the reading of the holy books; certain Churches wished to read the Acts of the Martyrs. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Africa, which possessed Acts of great value, signalized itself in this respect. Others followed its example. When the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> was more developed, probably under monastic influence, it became customary to read, after <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a>, the commentaries of the Fathers and of other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers on the passage of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> just previously heard. This innovation, which probably began in the sixth, or even in the fifth, century, brought into the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> the works of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, St. Hilary, St. Athanasius, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and others. To these, later, were added those of <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore</a>, <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, the <a href="02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, and so on. This new development of the Office gave rise to the compilation of special books. In primitive times the Book of Psalms and the books of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> sufficed for the Office. Later, books were compiled giving extracts from the <a href="14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="14530a.htm">New Testaments</a> (Lectionary, Gospel, and Epistle Books) for each day and each feast. Then followed books of <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> (Homiliaries) &#151; collections of sermons or of commentaries of the Fathers for use in the Office. All these books should be studied, for they form the constituent elements which later combined into the Breviary.</p>

<p>Further, as regards these lessons, it is well to notice that, as in the case of the psalmody, two lines of selection were followed. The first, that of the order of <a href="06043a.htm">ferial</a> Offices, ensures the reading of the Scripture, from Genesis to the Apocalypse, in sequence; the second, that of the order for feasts of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and festivals, breaks in upon this orderly series of readings and substitutes for them a chapter or a portion of a chapter specially applicable to the feast which is being celebrated.</p>

<p>The following is the table of lessons from the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. In its essential features, it goes back to a very venerable antiquity:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li><a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a> &#151; Isaias, and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a>.</li><li><a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, Epiphany &#151; <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, following this very ancient order: Epp. To Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, <a href="../bible/eph001.htm">Ephesians</a>, Philippians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews.</li><li><a href="13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a> and <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> &#151; Genesis and the other books of the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>.</li><li>Passiontide &#151; Jeremias.</li><li><a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and <a href="11516a.htm">Paschal Time</a> &#151; Acts of the App., Apocalypse, Epp. Of St. James, St. Peter, St. John.</li><li>Time after Pentecost &#151; Books of Kings.</li><li>Month of August &#151; Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, <a href="15666a.htm">Book of Wisdom</a>, Ecclesiasticus.</li><li>Month of September &#151; Job, Tobias, Judith, Esther.</li><li>Month of October &#151; Machabees.</li><li>Month of November &#151; Ezechiel, Daniel, the twelve minor Prophets. </li></ul></div>

<h3 id="F">Versicles and Little Chapters</h3>

<p>The <em>Capitulum</em>, or Little Chapter, is really a very short lesson which takes the place of lessons in those hours which have special ones assigned to them. These are: <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, Prime, <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, None, <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, and <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a>. By reason of their brevity and of their unimportance, they are much less complicated than the longer ones, and no more need here be said about them. The Versicles belong to the psalmody, like responsories and <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>; usually they are taken from a psalm, and belong to the category of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> acclamations or shouts of <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a>. They are usually employed after lessons and little chapters, and often take the place of responsories; they are, in fact, brief responsories. The <a href="06043a.htm">ferial</a> <em>Preces</em> and the Litanies probably belong to the category of versicles.</p>

<h3 id="G">Collects</h3>

<p>Collects, also called <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, are not psalmodic <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>; they are of a completely different character. Their place in the Breviary changes little; they come towards the end of the Office, after the psalmody, the lessons, little chapters, and versicles, but preceded by the <em>Dominus vobiscum</em>, and they gather up in a compendious form the supplications of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Their historical origin is as follows: During the earliest period, the president of the assembly, usually the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was entrusted with the task of pronouncing, after the psalmody, chants, and <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a>, a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the name of all the faithful; he therefore addressed himself directly to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. At first this <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> was an improvisation. The oldest examples are to be found in the <em>Didache ton Apostolon</em> and in the Epistle of St. Clement of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in certain Epistles of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. In time, towards the fourth century, collections of <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> were made for those who were not adepts in the art of improvisation; these were the earliest forerunners of Sacramentaries and Orationals, which later occupied so important a place in the history of the Liturgy. The Leonine, Gelasian, and Gregorian Sacramentaries form the chief sources whence are drawn the collects of our Breviary. It may be observed that they are of great <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> importance, and usually sum up the main <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> dominating a feast; hence, in them the significance of a festival is to be sought.</p>

<h2 id="section5">History of the breviary</h2>

<p>In the preceding paragraphs, a certain portion of the history of the Breviary, as a choir book at least, has been given. At first, there was no choir book, properly so called; the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> alone sufficed for all needs, for therein were the psalms for recitation and the books which furnished the various lessons. It is of course most probable that the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is the most ancient choir book; it was published apart to fulfil this special function, but with divisions &#151; marks to indicate the portions to be read; and at the end were copied out the canticles recited in the Office like the psalms, and sometimes, following each psalm, came one or more <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>. A study of <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="12543b.htm">Psalters</a>, which has not as yet been methodically undertaken, would be extremely useful for the Liturgy. Then, little by little, as the canonical Office was evolved, books were drawn up to meet the wants of the day &#151; Antiphonaries, Collectaria, etc. In the twelfth century John Beleth, a <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> author, enumerates the books needed for the due performance of the canonical Office, namely: &#151; the Antiphonary, the <a href="14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>, the Passionary (Acts of the Martyrs), the Legendary (Legends of the Saints), the Homiliary, or collection of <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the Gospels, the <em>Sermologus</em>, or collection of sermons, and the treatises of the Fathers. In addition to these should be mentioned the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalterium</a>, Collectarium for the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the Martyrology, etc. Thus, for the recitation of the canonical Office, quite a <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> was required. Some simplification became imperative, and the pressure of circumstances brought about a condensation of these various books into one. This is the origin of the Breviary. The word and the thing it represents appeared &#151; confusedly, it might be &#151; at the end of the eighth century. <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> is the author of an abridgment of the Office for the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> &#151; a few psalms for each day with a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> after each psalm, on an ancient plan, and some other <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>; but without including lessons or <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a>. It might rather be called a Euchology than a Breviary. About the same time Prudentius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, inspired by a similar motive, drew up a <em>Breviarium Psalterii.</em> But we must come down to the eleventh century to meet with a Breviary properly so called. The most ancient <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> known as containing within one volume the whole of the canonical Office dates from the year 1099; it comes from <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, and at the present time belongs to the Mazarin Library. It contains, in addition to other matter which does not concern the present inquiry, the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, canticles, <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a>, hymnary, collects, <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a> for the lessons, little chapters, <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, responsories, and lessons for certain Offices. Another <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, contemporary with the preceding, and also coming from <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, contains Propers of the Season and of the Saints, thus serving to complete the first-mentioned one. Other examples of the Breviary exist <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the twelfth century, still rare and all <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>. The history of these origins of the Breviary is still somewhat obscure; and the efforts at research must continue tentatively till a critical study of these <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Breviaries has been made on the lines of such workers as Delisle, Ebner, or Ehrensperger, on the Sacramentaries and Missals.</p>

<p>It was under <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216) that the use of Breviaries began to spread outside <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> circles. At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, no longer solely for the Roman Basilicas, but still for the Roman Court alone, <em>Breviaria</em> were drawn up, which, from their source, are called <em>Breviaria de Camer&acirc;</em>, or <em>Breviaria secundum usum Roman&aelig; Curi&aelig;.</em> Texts of this period (beginning of thirteenth century) speak of "Missalia, Breviaria, c&aelig;terosque libros in quibus Officium Ecclesiasticum continetur", and Raoul de Tongres specifically refers to this <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>. But this use of the Breviary was still limited, and was a kind of privilege reserved for the Roman Court. A special cause was needed to give the use of this Breviary a greater extension. The <a href="06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a>, or <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, lately founded, undertook the task of popularizing it. It was not a sedentary order vowed to stability, like those of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> or <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, or like the <a href="03288a.htm">Regular Canons</a>, but was an active, missionary, preaching order. It therefore needed an abridged Office, convenient to handle and contained in a single volume small enough to be carried about by the Friars on their journeys. This order adopted the Breviarium Curi&aelig; with certain modifications which really constitute, as it were, a second edition of this Breviary. It is sometimes called the Breviary of Gregory IX because it was authorized by that pontiff. One of the chief modifications effected by the <a href="06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> was the substitution of the <a href="06357a.htm">Gallican</a> version of the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> for the Roman. The cause was won; this eminently popular and active order spread the use of this Breviary everywhere. Antiphonaries, <a href="12543b.htm">Psalters</a>, Legendaries, and Responsoraries disappeared by degrees before the advance of the single book which replaced them all. Still more, by a kind of <em>jus postliminii</em> &#151; a right of resumption &#151; the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, under <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> (1277 &#151; 80), adopted the Breviary of the Friars not merely for the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>, but also for the Basilicas; and, as an inevitable consequence, this Breviary was bound, sooner or later, to become that of the Universal Church.</p>

<h2 id="section6">Reforms of the breviary</h2>

<p>In the preceding sections, the history of the ecclesiatical Office has been unfolded from its inception. If this history could be put into few words, though necessarily forming an incomplete statement, it might be said that from the first to the fifth century it was in formation; from the fifth to the eleventh century it was in process of development and expansion; and during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the Breviary properly so called was emerging into being. From then till now (that is, from the fourteenth century onwards) might be termed the period of reform. The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries represent for the Liturgy, as for the greater number of other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions, a period of decline, for it is the time of <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a>, and in that one word everything harmful is summed up. The few documents that are available for the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> history of that time attest this, as, for example, the "Gesta Benedicti XIII" and the "XV Ordo Romanus". Disorder and abuses crept into the Liturgy as into everything else.</p>

<p>Dom B&auml;umer, in his "Histoire du br&eacute;viaire", repeatedly points out that it is impossible to separate the history of the Liturgy from the occurrences that make up the general <a href="07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>, and that the phases through which the general history takes us are reflected in the evolution of the Liturgy. It is not surprising, therefore, that the sojourn of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and the Great Schism have exerted their baneful influence on the history of the Liturgy. And the reaction is still being felt. Raoul de Tongres, who died early in the fifteenth century, was even at that early period a critic and a reformer; in his famous work "De observanti&acirc; Canonum" he agitated for some settlement of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rules. The "XV Ordo Romanus" already referred to, the work of Amelius, <a href="13322a.htm">sacristan</a> to <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a> and librarian to <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>, breathes the same <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>. The abuses pointed out by the different authors of the time may be reduced to the following:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>The almost complete suppression of the Offices of <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and <a href="06043a.htm">ferias</a>, so that it became impossible that the whole <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> should be recited every week, and certain psalms were never recited at all.</li><li>An accumulation of Offices on the same day, tending to the destruction of their solemnity and also to the elimination of the Offices of the Season.</li><li>Substitution for the lessons from <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> of legends and <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> histories and of texts of <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> value for <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and responsories. On this subject the "Consultatio" presented by John de Arzo to the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> should be studied.</li><li>The introduction of <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a> usages, strange formularies of <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and feasts bordering in character on the grotesque.</li></ul></div>

<p>The <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a> of the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, which had its ardent champions even in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; as <a href="02425e.htm">Bembo</a>, <a href="13324a.htm">Sadoletus</a>, etc., to say nothing of certain <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> &#151; caused the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a special reform of the Breviary, in the direction of greater literary purity and perfection, to be entertained in certain quarters. Strange schemes were propounded, little in consonance with the spirit of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. A Florentine canon, Marsiglio Ficino, and Peter Pomponatius, for instance, suggested that the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> should read the classical authors instead of the Breviary. Others, though not going so far as this, thought the diction of the Breviary barbaric, and wanted to translate it into Ciceronian Latin. The corrections suggested included such astounding phrases as the following: the forgiveness of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> becomes "superosque manesque placare"; the Begetting of the Word was to be "Minerva Jovis capite orta"; the Holy Ghost was "Aura Zephyri coelestis", etc. These attempts failed; nevertheless, at a later date, under <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, similar Humanist tendencies came again to the surface and this time asserted their power by an emendation of the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>. Amongst such attempts may be mentioned that of Ferreri. He was the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07049a.htm">Guarda</a> Alfieri in the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, a Humanist, and wrote under the auspices and patronage of <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a>. He began with the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>. His work, which has been preserved, is interesting and contains some very beautiful pieces, polished in style. A good number of them have, unfortunately, nothing more of the spirit of poetry in them than harmony and rhythm; they are wanting in inspiration and above all in the warmth of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>; nearly all are strewn with <a href="11388a.htm">Pagan</a> names and allusions, representing <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> verities, as "Triforme Numen Olympi" for the Trinity, "Natus Eumolpho Lyricenque Sappho . . . Thracius Orpheus", referring to the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, etc. Ferreri also busied himself with a revision of the Breviary, but nothing was published, and now no trace of the materials he collected is forthcoming.</p>

<p>Another attempt at reform, much better known, and having results of far-reaching importance, was that of Quignonez, <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, who was entrusted by <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> with the task of completing the work begun by Ferreri. He was a <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and had been successfully employed on various commissions. His revision was the most original that has ever been attempted, and <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> experts, like <a href="07058a.htm">Gu&eacute;ranger</a>, Edmund Bishop, and B&auml;umer, have studied his labours in detail. Only the principal points of his scheme can be mentioned here. Considered theoretically, it cannot be denied that his Breviary is drawn up on easy, convenient, and <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> lines, and, on the whole is felicitously arranged. But in the light of tradition and of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> principles the only possible verdict in that Quignonez' Breviary, being constructed on a priori principles, violating most of the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rules, must be condemned. The author starts with the theory, contrary to all tradition, that an essential difference exists between the public celebration of the Office and its private recitation. For private recitation, therefore, all such portions as <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, responsories, versicles, little chapters, even <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> may be eliminated, as, according to Quignonez, these are meant solely for choir use. According to his arrangement, the entire <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> was to be recited once a week &#151; an excellent <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, in consonance with primitive practice; but it was applied too rigidly and narrowly, for no attention was paid to the suitability of certain psalms to special feasts. Feasts were never to change the order of the psalms, which were to be recited successively from <a href="../bible/psa001.htm">1</a> to <a href="../bible/psa150.htm">150</a>.</p>

<p>Every hour had three psalms; and in consequence of this severe regularity, there disappeared the deep and historical motive which gave to each hour its own characteristics. The <a href="09128a.htm">legends of the saints</a> and the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> underwent drastic, but designed, revision. Another principle, which would be deserving of all praise had it not been applied too rigorously, was that the entire Scriptures should be read through every year. Quignonez' Breviary, as might be expected, met both with enthusiastic approval and with determined opposition. Its success may be judged from the number of editions through which it passed. The Sorbonne criticized it severely, and other experts declared against Quignonez and attacked his work mercilessly. In the end, opposition <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> the stronger, and even <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> rejected it. Moreover, it was supplanted by other revisions made on more <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> lines, less ambitious in scope, and more in accordance with tradition. The newly founded Congregation of <a href="14557a.htm">Theatines</a> applied itself to this task with energy and enthusiasm. Caraffa, one of its founders, took a share in the work, and when he became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> (1555-59), he continued his labours, but died before seeing their completion, and it was thus reserved to others to bring them to a successful issue.</p>

<p>The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which effected reforms in so many directions, also took up the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of revising the Breviary; a commission was appointed concerning whose deliberations we have not much information, but it began to make definite inquiries about the subject entrusted to it. The council separated before these preliminaries could be concluded; so it was decided to leave the task of editing a new Breviary in the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> own hands. The commission appointed by the council was not dissolved, and continued its investigations. <a href="12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, at the beginning of his pontificate (1566), appointed new members to it and otherwise stimulated its activity, with the result that a Breviary appeared in 1568, prefaced by the famous <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Quod a nobis". The commission had adopted wise and reasonable principles: not to invent a new Breviary and a new Liturgy; to stand by tradition; to keep all that was worth keeping, but at the same time to correct the multitude of <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> which had crept into the Breviaries and to weigh just demands and complaints. Following these lines, they corrected the lessons, or legends, of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and revised the Calendar; and while respecting ancient <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> formularies such as the collects, they introduced needful changes in certain details. More intimate accounts of this revision should be studied at length in the approved authorities on the history of the Breviary. Here it will be enough to give a short sketch of the chief points affecting this Breviary, as it is substantially the same as that used at this <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>. The celebrated <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of approval, "Quod a nobis" (9 July, 1568), which prefaced it, explains the reasons which had weighed with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in putting forth an official text of public <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and gives an account of the labours which had been undertaken to ensure its correction; it withdrew the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> from all Breviaries which could not show a prescriptive right of at least two centuries of existence. Any Church which had not such an ancient Breviary was bound to adopt that of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The new Calendar was freed from a large number of feasts, so that the <a href="06043a.htm">ferial</a> Office was once more accorded a chance of occupying a less obscure position than of late it had. At the same time the real foundation of the Breviary &#151; the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> &#151; was respected, the principal alterations made being in the lessons. The legends of the saints were carefully revised, as also the <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a>. The work was one not only of critical revision, but also of discriminating conservatism, and was received with general approval. The greater number of the Churches of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and, generally, all the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> States, accepted this Breviary, saving only certain districts, as <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and Toledo, where ancient Rites were retained.</p>

<p>This Pian Breviary (Breviarium Pianum), while still remaining the official <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> book of the Universal Church, has undergone certain slight alterations in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, and these must here be noted, but without reference to the new feasts of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> which have been added to the Calendar century by century, even though they occupy a not inconsiderable space in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> disposition of the year. The chiefest and most important changes were made under <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. At first the text of the versions of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> used in the Liturgy was altered. As soon as the revision of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> undertaken during this pontificate was completed, the new text replaced the old one in all official books, particularly in the Breviary and the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a>. <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> instituted a new Congregation &#151; that of Rites &#151; 1588, charging it with a study of the reforms contemplated in the Pian Breviary, which had then been in use more than twenty years. To him is due the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of this revision of the Breviary, although till lately it had been ascribed to <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> (1592-1605). Although the first suggestion came from <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, nevertheless it was only under <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> that the work was really vigorously pushed forward and brought to a conclusion. The revising committee had as its members such men as <a href="02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, and Gavanti. The first-named especially played a most important part in this revision, and the report which he drew up has recently been published. The emendations bore especially on the <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a>: to the Common of Saints was added that of Holy Women not Virgins; the rite of certain feasts was altered; and some new feasts were added. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, "Cum in Ecclesi&acirc;", enjoining the observance of these alterations, is <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 May, 1602.</p>

<p>Further changes were made by <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1623-44). The commission appointed by him was content to correct the lessons and some of the <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a>, in the sense of making the text correspond more closely with the oldest <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. There would therefore be no call to treat of this revision under <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> at greater length but for the fact that, outside the work of this commission, he effected a still more important reform, over which even now discussion has not ceased to make itself heard. It affected the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>. <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, being himself Humanist, and no mean poet, as witness the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> of St. Martin and of <a href="05391a.htm">St. Elizabeth of Portugal</a>, which are of his own composition, desired that the Breviary <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> which it must be admitted are sometimes trivial in style and irregular in their prosody, should be corrected according to grammatical rules and put into <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> metre. To this end he called in the aid of certain <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of distinguished literary attainments. The corrections made by these purists were so numerous &#151; 952 in all &#151; as to make a profound alteration in the character of some of the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>. Although some of them without <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> gained in literary style, nevertheless, to the regret of many, they also lost something of their old charm of simplicity and fervour.</p>

<p>At the present date [1907], this revision is condemned, out of respect for ancient texts; and surprise may be expressed at the temerity that dared to meddle with the Latinity of a Prudentius, a Sedulius, a Sidonius Apollinaris, a <a href="06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a>, an Ambrose, a <a href="11586a.htm">Paulinus of Aquileia</a>, which, though perhaps lacking the purity of the Golden Age, has, nevertheless, its own peculiar charm. Even the more barbarous Latinity of a <a href="12617a.htm">Rhabanus Maurus</a> is not without its archaic interest and value. Moreover, the revisers were ill-advised inasmuch as they adopted a via media; they stopped half-way. If, as it is freely admitted, the <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> contains many <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> of inferior poetic worth, and whose sentiment is perhaps commonplace, then there is no reason why they should not be eliminated altogether, and replaced by new ones. Many of the older ones, however, were worthy of being preserved just as they stood; and, in the light of the progress made in philology, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that some of the corrections in prosody made under <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> convict their authors of <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of certain rhythmic rules, whose existence, it is only right to say, came to be known later. However it may be, these corrections have been retained till the present time. A comparison of the older with the modern text of the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> may be consulted in Daniel, "Thesaurus Hymnologicus", (Halle, 1841).</p>

<p>Nothing further was done under the successors of <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, except that new Offices were added from time to time, and that thus the <a href="06043a.htm">ferial</a> Office began again to lose ground. We must come down to the pontificate of <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, in the second half of the eighteenth century, to meet with another attempt at reform; but before doing so, reference must be made to efforts inaugurated in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, whose history has been learnedly elucidated in detail by <a href="07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> in vol. II of his "Institutions liturgiques", devoted in great part to an account of this struggle. The <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, revised by <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, had been received in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> without opposition. Under <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, however, attempts at revision were made, inspired by a spirit of resistance and antagonism to the Roman Court. They took form amongst the two parties which made open profession of Gallicanism and <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. The supporters of this reform, several of whom were men of learning and culture, were aided by the historical and critical works which at that time were being poured forth in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, so that in these projects for the reform of the Breviary, side by side with rash suggestions, there were many which were both useful and well judged. One of the first schemes was that of the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> Breviary, mooted in 1670 and pursued under the patronage of <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> <a href="07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> de P&eacute;r&eacute;fixe and de Harlay. The Breviary called after de Harlay appeared in 1680. The corrections it embodied affected in particular the <a href="09128a.htm">legends of the saints</a> and the <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a>, but numerous other parts were also touched. The details and the examination of them may best be studied in <a href="07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger's</a> pages. Although it might have seemed that the Breviary had by then been sufficiently emended, in the following century another <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Monseigneur de Vintimille, had another Breviary drawn up, which was published in 1736, and remained in use till the middle of last century. It partly embodied what is called the "liturgical Utopia of Quignonez". Its source, however, was not above suspicion, for some of those who had laboured at its production were <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. This reform, while not wanting in sound ideals, was carried out, however, regardless of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> traditions.</p>

<p>What had been going on in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> had its counterpart in other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, where new Breviaries were were introduced, for the most part inspired by the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> which had dominated those of de Harlay and of Vintimille. A reaction against these broke out in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> between 1830 and 1840, having for its leader a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, <a href="07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> and an eminent liturgist, who, in his "Institutions liturgiques", arraigned the new Breviaries, exposed the mistakes underlying their construction, and <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that their authors had acted without warrant. His onslaught met with immediate success for in twenty years the greater number of the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> gave up their <a href="06357a.htm">Gallican</a> Breviaries and adopted once more the Roman Liturgy. The exact figures are as follows: in 1791 eighty <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> had rejected the Roman Liturgy and had fashioned special <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a> for themselves; in 1875 Orl&eacute;ans, the last French diocese which had retained its own liturgy re-entered Roman <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> unity.</p>

<p>While <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was letting herself be carried away in the reform of her Breviaries by Gallican and <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> leanings, other countries were following in her wake. In <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Scipio Ricci, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pistoia, an ardent <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>, drew up a new Breviary, and certain districts of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> adopted the same course, with the result that Breviaries modelled on those of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> appeared at <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, Mnnster, and <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; and it was long before <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> returned to <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> unity.</p>

<p>While the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> and Gallicans were creating a new Liturgy, Prosper Lambertini, one of the most learned men in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, determined to copy the example of some of his predecessors, and to carry out a further reform of the Breviary. A congregation was instituted for the special purpose; its papers, for long unedited, have of late years been gone through by MM. <a href="13194a.htm">Roskov&aacute;ny</a> and Chaillot, each of whom has published considerable portions of them. The first meeting of the congregation was in 1741, and the discussions which took place then and later are of interest from the liturgist's point of view, but need not detain us. Although this project of reform came to nothing, nevertheless the work accomplished by the congregation was of real value and reflects credit on its members, some of whom, like Giorgi, were eminent <a href="09306a.htm">liturgists</a>. Future workers in this department of learning will have to take account of their collections. After the death of <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (4 May, 1758) the labours of this congregation were suspended and were never again seriously resumed. Since <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV's</a> time changes in the Breviary have been very few, and of minor importance, and can be outlined in a few words. Under <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> the question of a reform of the Breviary was brought up once more. By that pontiff's orders a scheme was drawn up and presented to the Congregation of Rites, but it was found impossible to overcome the difficulties which surrounded an undertaking of this kind. In 1856 <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> appointed a commission to examine the question: is the reform of the Breviary opportune? But again only preliminary matters engaged their attention. Amongst the Acts of the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> a series of propositions are to be found, whose object was the simplification or correction of the Breviary, but the inquiry never got beyond that stage. Finally, under <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, a commission was appointed, at the close of 1902, whose <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> were a study of historico-liturgical questions. Its province is a wider one, comprising not only the Breviary, but also the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the Pontifical, and the Ritual. It has, further, to supervise future <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> editions, and thus to see that they conform as closely as possible with historical data. This commission, though attached to the Congregation of Rites, is nevertheless autonomous. It consisted at first of five members under the presidency of Monsignor Duchesne, namely: Mgr. Wilpert, Father Ehrle, S.J., Father Roberti, Mgr. Umberto Benigni, Mgr. Mercati, and a few consultors. What the results of their labours may be is not yet known.</p>

<p>This sketch of the reforms of the Breviary proves, however, the desire of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to eliminate the blemishes which disfigure this book. All these efforts have not been sterile; some of these revisions mark real progress; and it may be hoped that the present commission will effect certain improvements which the progress of historical studies and criticism have made the more needful.</p>
