<p>Date of birth unknown; died 13 December, 1124. His reign, beginning 1 February, 1119, is signalized by the termination of the Investiture controversy which, begun in the time of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, had raged with almost unabated bitterness during the last quarter of the eleventh century and the opening years of the twelfth. Guido, as he was called before his elevation to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, was the son of Count William of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and both by his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> and mother's side was closely connected with nearly all the royal houses of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. His brother Hugh had been appointed <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, and he himself was named <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne (1088), and afterwards appointed <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by Paschal II. During Guido's tenure in this office, Paschal II, yielding to the threats of Henry V, was induced to issue the "Privilegium" (1111) by which he yielded up much of what had been claimed by <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, but these concessions were received with violent opposition and nowhere more so than in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, where the opposition was led by Guido, the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. The latter was present at the Lateran Synod (1112), and on his return to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> convoked an assembly of the French and <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Vienne (1112), where the investiture of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was denounced as <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and sentence of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> pronounced against Henry V because he had dared to extort from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> an agreement opposed to the interests of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. These decrees were sent to Paschal II with a request for confirmation, which they received in general terms, 20 October, 1112 (<a href="07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> VI, 2, 1916).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Guido was later, apparently, created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="11514b.htm">Pope Paschal</a>, though the latter does not seem to have been quite pleased with his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> in his attacks upon <a href="07232a.htm">Henry V</a>. On the death of <a href="11514b.htm">Paschal II</a> (21 Jan., 1118), Gelasius II was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, but he was immediately seized by the Italian allies of Henry V, and on his liberation by the populace fled to <a href="06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, where he was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a>. Henry V demanded the confirmation of the "Privilegium", but, receiving no satisfactory reply, set up as <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> under the name of <a href="06795b.htm">Gregory VIII</a>, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02728a.htm">Braga</a>, Burdinus, who had already been deposed and <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for having <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> Henry at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the imperial crown (1117). Gelasius promptly <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> both the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> and the emperor, but was himself <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee, and took refuge in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cluny, where he died (January, 1119). On the fourth day after the death of Gelasius (1 February), owing mainly to the exertions of Cardinal Cuno, Guido was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and assumed the title of Callistus II. He was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> at Vienne (9 February, 1119).</p>

<p>His election was everywhere received with <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a>. On account of his close connection with the royal <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, it was hoped that he would be able to effect a favourable settlement of the controversy which had so long distracted the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even Henry V received the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> embassy at <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and showed clearly that he was not unwilling to sue for peace, and at the same time he withdrew his support from the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>. It was even agreed that <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor should meet at Mousson. In 1119 (8 June) Callistus held a synod at <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> mainly to promote disciplinary reforms in the French Church, and in October of the same year he opened the council at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> which had been contemplated in the preliminary arrangements made between the emperor and the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> ambassadors at <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. Louis VI and most of the barons of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> attended the council, which was composed of more than four hundred <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>. It had been arranged that during the council the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor were to have a personal conference at Mousson, and in compliance with this agreement Henry V arrived at Mousson, not alone, as had been anticipated, but with an army of over thirty thousand men. Callistus II left <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> to attend the conference at Mousson, but on learning of the warlike preparations made by the emperor, and fearing that force was likely to be used to extract from him prejudicial concessions, he hastily returned to <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Here the council busied itself mainly with disciplinary regulations, especially with decrees against investiture, <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>, and <a href="04207a.htm">concubinage</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the end, as there was no hope of a favourable compromise with Henry, it was determined that the emperor and the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> should be solemnly <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in the presence of the assembled fathers and the representatives of the <a href="02137c.htm">secular authority</a> (30 October, 1119). Before leaving <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> Callistus tried to effect a settlement between Henry I of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and his brother Robert, but his efforts in this direction were without result.</p>

<p>Callistus determined to visit <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the latter city <a href="06795a.htm">Gregory VIII</a>, supported by the German forces and the Italian allies of the emperor, had taken up his residence, but on the approach of Callistus, who was everywhere received with demonstrations of welcome, the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee to the fortress of Sutri, and Callistus entered <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> amid the universal rejoicings of the populace. He went south to secure the aid of the Normans of Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> in his struggle against Henry V and <a href="06795a.htm">Gregory VIII</a>. The negotiations were entirely satisfactory. <a href="06795a.htm">Gregory</a> was taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> and escorted to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1121), where he was with difficulty saved from the wrath of the people, and lodged in a <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> near <a href="13396b.htm">Salerno</a> and afterwards in the fortress of Fumo. By the aid of the princes of Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> Callistus broke the power of the Italian allies of the emperor in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, notably of Cencio Frangipani, who had already given so much trouble to Gelasius II and to Callistus himself (1121).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Having thus established his power in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he once more resolved to open negotiations with Henry V on the question of investiture. The latter had already shown that he was anxious to put an end to a controversy which had alienated from him his best friends, and which threatened to endanger the peace of the empire. An embassy consisting of three <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> was sent by Callistus to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and negotiations for a permanent settlement of the investiture struggle were begun at Wurzburg (October, 1121). Here it was agreed that a general truce should be proclaimed between the emperor and his rebellious subjects; that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> should have free use of her possessions; that the lands of those in rebellion should be restored, and peace with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> permanently established with the least possible delay. These decrees were communicated to Callistus II, who despatched Cardinal Lambert of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a> as his <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to assist at the synod that had been convoked at Worms. The synod began at Worms, 8 September, 1122, and 23 September the concordat known as the Concordat of Worms (or <em>Pactum Calixtinum</em>) between the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor was concluded. On his side the emperor abandoned his claim to investiture with ring and <a href="04515c.htm">crosier</a> and granted freedom of election to <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>; on the other hand, it was conceded that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> should receive investiture with the sceptre, that the episcopal elections should be held in the presence of the emperor or his representatives, that in case of disputed elections the emperor should, after the decision of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and the suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, confirm the rightfully elected candidate, and lastly, that the imperial investiture of the temporalities of the sees should take place in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> before the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, in <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> after this <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, while in the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> alone had the right of investiture, without any interference on the part of the emperor. As a result of this Concordat, the emperor still retained in his hands the controlling influence in the election of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, though he had abandoned much in regard to episcopal elections in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>.</p>

<p>To secure the confirmation of this Concordat of Worms, Calistus II convoked the <a href="09016b.htm">First Lateran Council</a> (18 March, 1123). The council was most representative, nearly three hundred <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and six hundred <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> from every part of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> being present. The council solemnly confirmed the agreement that had been arrived at with Henry V with regard to episcopal elections, and passed several disciplinary decrees directed against existing abuses, such as <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="04207a.htm">concubinage</a> among the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Decrees were also passed against violators of the <a href="15068a.htm">Truce of God</a>, church-robbers, and forgers of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> documents. The <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> already granted to the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> were renewed, and the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> over the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, both <a href="13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="12722c.htm">regular</a>, was more clearly defined.</p>

<p>In the last few years of his life, Callistus II endeavoured to secure for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> the restoration in its entirety of the <a href="14257a.htm">Patrimony of St. Peter</a>, which had been greatly diminished by the constant <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> and rebellions; to break the power of the nobles in the Campagna, and restore peace and order to the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, which had suffered much since the time of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>. He also devoted much of his time to the interests of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and to combating the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> and abuses which made their appearance in that country in his time. In the Synod of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1119) he condemned the teaching of Peter de Bruis and his followers (<a href="07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> VI, 2, 1977-84). He established the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Vienne as the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church of the adjoining ecclesiastical provinces (1120), thereby ending in favour of the former (that he still held as <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>) the ancient controversy between Vienne and Arles. For the privileges in favour of Vienne forged during the reign of Guido, see Gundlach, "Streit der Bisthumer Arles und Vienne" (1890). Duchesne maintains ("Fastes Eccl.", I, 145 sqq.) that only the more recent of them date from the time of Guido (cf. Robert, "Calixte II", Paris, 1891). He settled several disputes between <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, dispatched Gerard of <a href="01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to Brittany, and finally confirmed the <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="13716a.htm">Sens</a>. He demanded of Henry I of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> the release of his brother, Robert of Normandy, as well as the acknowledgment of Thurstan, whom he himself had <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>. Henry at first refused, but on the threat of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> he consented to admit Thurstan as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, and to acknowledge the latter <a href="05001a.htm">see's</a> independence of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> he transferred the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> from the old see of <a href="10202a.htm">M&eacute;rida</a> (<em>Emerita</em>) to Santiago de Compostella, to the <a href="11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of which Callistus seems to have had a special devotion. He showed his attention to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by the <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Conrad of Constance at the Lateran Synod (1123) and by dispatching Otto of <a href="02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to regulate the Churches of <a href="12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>. In <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he devoted much attention to beautifying and improving the city, but especially the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter. He suppressed the suburban See of Santa Rufina by uniting this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> with Porto, so that thenceforth there were only six <a href="03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a> instead of seven as had formerly been the case.</p>

<p>Callistus died in 1124, and after some dispute Honorius II was selected as his successor. As to the great influence of the reign of Callistus II on the policy of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> there can be no dispute. Owing mainly to him the concessions so weakly made by Paschal II were recalled, and on his own accession to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne, his firmness and strength of character secured a settlement of the controversy between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> which, though not entirely satisfactory, was at least sufficient to assure a much needed peace. Through his exertions he put an end to the wholesale bestowal of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices by <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>; he re-established the freedom of canonical elections and secured recognition of the principle that <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> can come only from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, while on the other hand he conceded to the <a href="02137c.htm">secular authorities</a> the influence to which they were rightly entitled in the election of <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> who were at the same time the most powerful and richest subjects of the State. On the other hand, he was blamed at the time, principally by Archbishop Conrad of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, for not insisting upon the withdrawal of the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of homage which every <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was required to make to the emperor or his <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> lord, but it should be remembered that Callistus II well understood that unless something were conceded peace was impossible, and that the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of homage, however improper the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> might seem, was not an unnatural demand on the part of the emperor in regard to subjects who wielded such an enormous political power as did the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>.</p>

<p>Callistus II was not very remarkable for his literary productions; yet a few works have come down to us which are ascribed to his pen. They are: "De Miraculis Sancti Jacobi Apostoli", "De obitu et Vita Sanctorum", "Vita Caroli Magni Imperatoris". Many letters attributed to him are preserved. These, together with his other writings, may be found in <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CLXIII (1073-1383). Besides this edition, thirty-six of his letters are contained in <a href="07135c.htm">Hardouin's</a> "Concilia" (VI, 2, 1949-1976). These same letters, with two additional, are published by Mansi (XXI, 190-218); some others are given by D'Achery [Spicilegium (Paris, 1723), II, 964; III, 478, 479]; some additional ones are to be found in "Magn. Bull. Rom. Continuat.", III, ed. Luxembourg, 1730, 12. See <a href="08084b.htm">INVESTITURES</a>; VIENNE.</p>
