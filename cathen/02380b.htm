<p><a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople in the second half of the thirteenth century, one of the few Greek <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who were sincerely in favour of reunion with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was born in the early part of the thirteenth century in Constantinople, where he joined the ranks of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. His ability, learning and moral qualities marked him for advancement and he was soon promoted to the office of <em>chartophylax</em>. The Patriarch Arsenius (1255-66) held him in high esteem, and defended him against the emperor's displeasure which he had incurred by suspending a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> who blessed a marriage in the church of an imperial palace without permission. Beccus, however, recovered the imperial favor and gradually gained the confidence of Michael Pal&aelig;ologus (1259-82). He was selected repeatedly to conduct delicate or difficult negotiations with foreign potentates. His sentiments towards the <a href="09022a.htm">Christians of Western Europe</a>, or the Latins, were not at all friendly at the beginning. When, after the destruction of the Latin Empire in Constantinople, the Emperor Michael Pal&aelig;ologus conceived the plan of reuniting the Greek and the Latin Churches, the Patriarch Joseph (1268-75) and his <em>chartophylax</em>, John Beccus, were strongly opposed to it. In a meeting of the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of Constantinople held about the year 1273, Beccus declared in the presence of the emperor that the Latins were in reality <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, although they were not called thus. His audacity was punished with <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. In his enforced retirement Beccus found leisure to study the points of difference between the Greeks and Latins. The emperor, anxious to win him over, sent such writings to him as were favourable to the views of the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, among, them the works of <a href="02596c.htm">Nicephorus Blemmida</a> or Blemmydes. From the works of <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>, Maximus the Confessor, and others he learned that the Greek and the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> substantially agreed on matters of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. The only difference was, that while the Latin writers considered the Holy Ghost to proceed from Father and Son, the Greeks preferred to state the He proceeds from the Father through the Son. Once satisfied on this subject, he became actively interested in the work of reunion, and retained these sentiments to the end. Meanwhile the union was happily concluded in the council held at Lyon (1274) and proclaimed at Constantinople (January 1275). The Patriarch Joseph could not be induced to accept it, and was removed from his office according to a previous understanding. John Beccus was elected in his place. On the 2d of June, Pentecost Sunday, 1275, he received the episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>After his elevation to the patriarchal see one of his main objects was to convince of the lawfulness of the union those of the Greeks who were either partisans of the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> or else had renounced it only in a half-hearted way. In April, 1277, a synod was held in Constantinople, where the union was again approved; a letter was also written to <a href="08429c.htm">Pope John XXI</a> (1276-77), which acknowledged the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy and the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the Latin <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on the Procession of the Holy Ghost. When a faction of the schismatics rebelled against the emperor, John Beccus <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> them (July, 1277), while Michael Pal&aelig;ologus defeated their armies. In 1279, Beccus assured the <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> of <a href="11056a.htm">Pope Nicholas III</a> (1277-80), then in Constantinople that the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> entirely agreed with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in matters of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Several <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were held shortly afterwards, all with the same object in view; and in one of them it was discovered that a certain Penteclesiota had tampered with a passage of <a href="07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, where testimony was rendered to the procession of the Holy Ghost from Father and Son. Finally he tried also to defend in writing the doctrines of the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, although at first he had resolved not to notice the many pamphlets of the schismatics, lest he should make the dissensions even greater.</p>

<p>The intercourse of Beccus with the emperor was not always pleasant. The patriarch pleaded much with his Imperial master for the needy and for those <a href="08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned by the officers of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. But the emperor grew weary of these importunities and restricted the patriarch's liberty of access to him. Matters were aggravated by the enemies of the union, who purposely <a href="03190c.htm">calumniated</a> Beccus, as if his conduct were immoral, as if he misused the treasures of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and insulted or even cursed the emperor. Such accusations were not altogether unwelcome; and the emperor, to show his indignation, curtailed the patriarch's <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all the sacred places that were outside of Constantinople. Thereupon Beccus grew tired of his office, resigned, and withdrew to a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in March, 1279. But as the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a> arrived soon after, he was induced to resume his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> and to treat with the representatives of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, which he did as related before. After the death of Michael Pal&aelig;ologus, which occurred 11 December, 1282, the union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was at once denounced by the new Emperor Andronicus (1282-1328) and Beccus was forced to resign. In a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 1283, he was forced to sign his name to a creed prepared by his enemies, and to abdicate the patriarchal office, after which he was banished to the city of Prusa in Bithynia. In 1284, he was again summoned to a synod in Constantinople; but he defended energetically the doctrines of the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, for which he was confined to the fortress of St. Gregory on the Black Sea, where he underwent many privations. Nothing, however could induce him to sacrifice his convictions, He still continued to write in favour of the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. Death brought an end to his sufferings about the year 1298.</p>

<p>The principal works of John Beccus (in P.G., CXLI) are the following: "Concerning the Union and Peace of the Churches of Ancient and New Rome"; "The Epigraph&aelig;", a collection of passages from the Fathers; "On the Procession of the Holy Ghost"; the polemical works against Photius, Andronicus Camateros, and Gregory of <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>; the works addressed to his friends Theodore, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sugd&aelig;a in Moesia, and a certain Constantine; to Agallianos Alexios, a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Constantinople; several orations and an "Apologia"; his "Testamentum" written while in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>. In all of these writings there is a sincere conviction of the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> defended by him, and great enthusiasm for the peace of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> through union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, among whose Greek adherents Beccus holds easily the first place.</p>
