<p>An institution almost coeval with the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> itself. The principle of arbitration presupposes that the <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> or groups of <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> submitting to arbitrament are united in some common bond. As soon therefore as this common bond has come prominently before public opinion, there necessarily results a tendency to settle disputes by reference to it. Thus the growth of law, i.e. the gradual evolution from private revenge or vendetta to the judgment of some <a href="02137c.htm">public authority</a>, can in the history of any known nation or tribe be traced parallel with the awakening feeling of social solidarity. It was just because men began to realize, however rudely, that they were not single units but members of a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, that they understood how every tort or wrong-doing disturbed not merely the individual directly affected, but the whole body of which he was a member. It was this recognition of the social disadvantages of disorder that led to compromise, to mutual pledges, to trials by combat, to ordeals, and eventually to the regulations of courts of law. This is most patently manifest among the Northern nations in the primitive history of the jury system.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Now this same principle was bound to operate internationally whenever the various groupings of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> realized their solidarity. The same undoubted advance would be made when men became conscious that the theory into which law had developed as an adjudication between <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> by the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, was applicable also in matters of international dispute. But this consciousness required to be preceded by the recognition of two principles:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(1) that nations were moral <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a></li><li>(2) that they were united in some common organism.</li></ul></div>

<p>The first principle was too abstract in its nature to be professed explicitly at once (Figgis, "From Gerson to Grotius", vi, 177). The second would be very quickly recognized if only some concrete symbol of it could become evident to public opinion. This concrete symbol was fortunately at hand, and the result was arbitration. For the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> directing the <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, legislating for the newly-converted peoples, drawing to itself the representatives of each national episcopate, constituting a sacred shrine for royal <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, could not fail to impress on the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian nations</a> a sense of their common <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. It was the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> which therefore at one and the same time, by treating each nation as a separate unit, expressed in a <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> with his suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and yet by legislating identically in matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> for all the nations, expounded the double thesis of nationalism and internationalism. It was a standing concrete expression of the two principles aforesaid, viz, that the nations were separate <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>, yet members of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> brotherhood, moral <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> yet subject to the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Hence, owing to the circumstances of Western politics, papal arbitration was a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequence of the very <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. In treating of papal arbitration, three points must be set out:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(A) the principles on which the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> claimed the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to arbitrate, i.e. the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> theory of the relationship between the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the temporal powers;</li><li>(B) the most important cases of historical arbitration by the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>;</li><li>(C) the future opportunity for this arbitration.</li></ul></div>

<h2 id="section1">The papal theory</h2>

<p>It is evident that before the conversion of Constantine there could have been little question of the relations between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was undeniably conscious of her independence, but up to that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had practically none but spiritual <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> to perform. The Apostolic writings preach submission to authority and do not at all raise the problem of the adjustment of the relationship between <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and C&aelig;sar. The conversion of Constantine therefore opened up a large field of speculation. This begins indeed from the assembling of the <a href="11044a.htm">General Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325). Here, according to Rufinus (H. E., I, ii, in P .L., XXI, 470), the emperor himself laid the basis of all development in this direction. He declared that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> had given to the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> (i.e. to the whole <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporation) power to judge even emperors (<em>et ideo nos a vobis recte judicamur</em>).</p>

<p><a href="07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a>, who had been president of that council, in his defence of <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> has the same thought, noting that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> had given to Constantine the empire and to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> He had confided the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (quoted by St. Athanasius, "History of the Arians", xliv, in P.G., XXV, 717). This entire separation of the two powers, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and lay, is generally laid down with very definite clearness by the earlier writers (<a href="09410b.htm">Lucifer of Cagliari</a>, "Pro Athanasio", in P.L., XIII, 826; <a href="11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>, "De Schismate Donatistarum", III, iii, in P.L., XI, 999). Not that any slight is put upon the imperial dignity, for to the prince first of all is applied the title which subsequently becomes proper to the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> alone. He is called <em>Vicarius Dei</em> (<a href="01406a.htm">Ambrosiaster</a>, "Qu&aelig;stiones Veteris et Novi Testamenti XCI", in P.L., XXV, 2284; Sedulius Scotus, "De Rectoribus Christianis", 19 in P.L., CXII, 329). Yet he has no <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the spiritual functions of his subjects, "for who", says <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (Ep., XXI, 4, ad Valentinum, II, in P.L., XVI, 1046), "would venture to deny that in matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, it is the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who sit in judgment over emperors, and not the emperors who sit in judgment over <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>?"; and the two <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> who first have any prominent teaching on the matter, <a href="06030b.htm">Felix III</a> (483) and Gelasius I (492), use precisely the same language, describing <a href="14250c.htm">the Church and the State</a> as two parallel powers, entirely separate.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>"The emperor", says Gelasius in an epigram (Ep. XV, 95, ad Episcopos Orientales, in P.L., LIX), "is the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> son, not sovereign" (<em>Filius est non pr&oelig;sul ecclesi&oelig;</em>). This <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> has fortunately left us two complete treatises on this question. In his Fourth Tractate and his Eighth Letter (P.L., LIX, 41), he formulates his views, which completely agree with this <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of two different orders, separate, yet in so far interdependent that they both work towards the same purpose, i.e. the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of men. The next step is marked by the forcible and clear <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (590). His relations with the emperors are too well-known to need restatement. It will be sufficient to note that, in his own words, he would go as far as possible to accept every law and statute of the imperial throne. "If what he does is according to the canons, we will follow him; if it be contrary to the canons, then so far as may be without <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, we will bear with him" (Epist., Lib. XI, 47, in P.L., LXXVII, 1167). Indeed, when in actual fact the Emperor Maurice prohibited public officials from entering <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory</a> <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, though at the same time warning Maurice that it by no means agreed with the declared will of the <a href="11251c.htm">Divine Omnipotence</a>. By thus acting he said he had performed his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of obeying the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a> and yet had kept his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by declaring the matter of that obedience unlawful (Lib. III, 65, in P.L., LXXVII, 663).</p>

<p>A last example of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of this period may be taken from the writings of this same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Maurice had given judgment in some matter, contrary to the sacred <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and canons. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nicopolis, who as <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="04362a.htm">Corcyra</a> happened to be concerned in the affair, appealed to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> against the imperial rescript. <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory</a> wrote admitting the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> interpretation to be correct and adhering to it, yet declared that he could not dare publicly to censure the emperor lest he should seem in any way to oppose or despise the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>. (Lib. XIV, 8, in P.L., LXXXII, 1311). His whole <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> appears to have been that the prince represented <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Every action therefore of the <a href="02137c.htm">public authority</a> (whether it tended to the sacred ends for which Government was founded, or was apparently destructive of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> liberties) was equally to be respected or at least not publicly to be flouted. This curious position taken up by the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, of excessive subservience to the civil rulers, was due to a threefold cause:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(a) The need of correcting a certain <a href="01452a.htm">anarchical</a> spirit noted by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (1 Peter 2:15, 16; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs1">Galatians 5:1</a>; <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs17">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="../bible/1th004.htm#vrs10">1 Thessalonians 4:10, 11, 5:4</a>).</li><li>(b) The relation in which the protected Church stood to the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperor, represented by the words of <a href="11262b.htm">St. Optatus</a>, "De Schismate Donatistarum", III, iii: "Non enim respublica est in Ecclesia, sed Ecclesia in republica est . . . Super Imperatorem non sit nisi solus Deus" (The state is not in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is in the state . . . Let <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone be above the emperor).</li><li>(c) The influence of the Biblical language as regards the theocratic kingship of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</li></ul></div>

<p>The teaching of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> that <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a> was held independently of any <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> gift was continued even in the days of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, whose father owed so much of his power to <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> influence (Decretals, I, 6, 34). Yet even the new line of C&aelig;sars claimed to hold their power of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Their titles run "Gratia Dei Rex" or "Per misericordiam Dei rex" etc. (cf. Coronation of Charlemagne in "Journal of Theological Studies", April and July, 1901). Thus through the ninth and tenth centuries the separation-theory of Pope Gelasius was generally taught and admitted. Both <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor claimed to hold their power direct from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. He is the sole source of all authority. A new theory, however, was developing. While admitting that civil rulers are of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the good by <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> direct appointment, the wicked by <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> permission for the chastisement and correction of the people's <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a>, "Ep. xv ad Karolum regem", in P.L., CXXVI, 98), some writers partially broach the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that without <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> the king is no king at all, but a tyrant (Mon. Germ. Hist.: Epp., IV, "Epistola Vari&aelig; Karoli Magni Script.", 7 etc.), for he must govern according to the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> which in turn depend on the consent of the people (<a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a>, "De Ordine Palatii", 8, in M. G. H.: Leg., sect. II, vol. II).</p>

<p>Thus the compact-theory of a mutually binding engagement between sovereign and subjects enters the full stream of <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> political thought. It is perpetuated in the Old English Coronation <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a> (Stubbs, "Select Charters", Oxford, 1900, 64 etc.). The use made of this theory by the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> will appear shortly. So far then the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> political ideals sketched out two authorities, independent, separate; the one supreme in temporal matters, the other in spiritual. Then in the tenth century, the point was raised, at first in a perfectly academic way, as to the relative importance of these two spheres of Government, as to which took precedence of the other. At first, the result of the controversy left things more or less as they had been. The one side asserted that the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was the higher, because, while it was <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> had to render obedience to kings in temporal matters and the kings to <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in spiritual matters, yet on the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> rested the further burden of responsibility of seeing that the king performed his temporal <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> in a fitting way, i.e. that the king's actions were matters of <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, therefore matters of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> and therefore matters that lay under the <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>These arguments may be briefly summarized thus:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(a) that both powers lay within the physical pale of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>;</li><li>(b) that the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> was responsible for seeing that the king did his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>;</li><li>(c) that the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the king and not vice versa.</li></ul></div>

<p>The others ("Tractatus Eboracensis", in M. G. H.: Libelli de Lite, III, 662 sq.) replied by asserting that the emperor had no less to see that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> affairs were properly conducted (as much later Sigismund at <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>; Lodge, "Close of Middle Ages", London, 1904, 212). Thus <a href="09157b.htm">Leo III</a> and <a href="09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> had submitted practically to the interference of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (800) and Louis II (853); and the concrete example of the Synod of Ponthiou (853), summoned by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and commanded by the emperor, was a standing example of this general responsibility of each for the other (M. G. H.: Leg., II, vol. II, no. 279). It is interesting however to recall a distinction thrown out almost at hazard by a twelfth-century canonist (Rufinus, "Summa Decretorum", D. xxi. c. 1). Commenting on a supposed letter of <a href="11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> to the people of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, he distinguishes the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> right to interfere in temporal matters by conceding to him not a <em>jus administrationis</em> but a <em>jus jurisdictionis</em>, i.e. the right of consecrating, etc.</p>

<p>The advent (1073) of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> chair greatly affected the policy of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (Tout, "Empire and Papacy", London, 1909, 126; Gosselin, "Power of the Pope in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>"). But it is not so much his actions as his theories which are here under consideration. He took over the old patristic teaching that all rule and government had its origin in the fall of Adam, that <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> caused the necessity for one man to have command over another. Consequently he had hard things to say of the imperial position. Moreover he claimed more power than his predecessors. Both he and the emperor took extreme views of their respective offices. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> wished to put himself at the head of the temporal rule, exercising the power described in Jeremias i, 10. The emperor spoke of his traditional right of appointing and deposing <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. Neither can be taken as representing the general sentiment of their time. The story of <a href="03298a.htm">Canossa</a> with its legendary details is no more representative of public opinion in the eleventh century than is the dramatic surrender of <a href="11514b.htm">Pascal II</a> in the twelfth. <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, despite his high <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> and noble character, does not really continue the teaching of his predecessors.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Eventually, the Concordat of Worms (23 Sept., 1122) took up and handed down the average <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> political practice, Without satisfying the extreme representatives of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> or imperial claims. <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, however, developed the <a href="04332a.htm">contractual</a> <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Coronation <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>. This he declared to be, as were all other <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a>, under the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> dominion, and consequently could be annulled by <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, thus releasing subjects from obedience to their sovereign (Decretum, causa xv, Q. 6, c. 2; <a href="14291c.htm">Stephen of Tournai</a>, "Summa Decretorum", causa xv, Q. 6, c. 2. Auctorit. iii). The next great <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> ruler, <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216), did not take the same attitude toward temporal power, though in personal exercise of authority he exceeded <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory</a>. He says explicitly: "We do not exercise any temporal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> except indirectly" (Epistol&aelig;, IV, 17, 13). He interfered, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, to annul the election of Philip of Suabia and to confirm Otto in the imperial dignity, but he was at pains to point out that his <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> was only a <em>denunciator</em>, or declarer of worthiness, not a <em>cognitor</em> or elector. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> could not override the electoral system of the empire, he could only judge, confirm, and, in divided elections only, decide on the candidate (Decretals, 1, 6, 34; Carlyle, "History of Medi&aelig;val Political Thought", II, 217; Barry, "Papal Monarchy", XVIII, 292).</p>

<p>Again in the dispute between the French and English Kings, <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> distinctly declares that he makes no claim to settle matters of fiefs (<em>non enim intendimus judicare de feudo cujus ad ipsum spectat judicium</em>, <a href="04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, ii, I, 13). Nor had he any intention of diminishing the royal authority. His whole justification rests on three grounds:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(a) the English king had appealed to him against his brother-king on the Gospel principle, for it was a matter of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, i.e. against peace;</li><li>(b) Philip had himself appealed earlier against <a href="13041b.htm">Richard I</a>;</li><li>(c) A treaty had been made, confirmed by <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a>, then broken.</li></ul></div>

<p>This therefore lay within the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. On another occasion, he even went so far as to order the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> to declare null and void any letters produced from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> dealing with matters that belonged to the secular courts of <a href="15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, as he would only interfere on appeal, especially since the imperial dignity was at the moment vacant (Decretals, ii, 2, 10; cf. <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III's</a> action in a similar case, <a href="04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, ii, 2, 6). Even <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was in his hands no arbitrary power, for, if it were applied <a href="08010c.htm">unjustly</a> or even unreasonably, he protested that it would be null and void (Decretals, v, 39, 28). He retained of course in his own hands the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to decide whether a particular matter came within the cognizance of the spiritual courts or not (Ibid., iv, 17, 13).</p>

<p>After <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent's</a> death, the attitude of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> was revived by <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (1294-1303) and <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1316-34). Though some twenty years separate their reigns, these two pontiffs held practically the same attitude towards temporal rulers and gave rise to a large polemical literature, which is practically continuous for some fifty years (see <a href="13553a.htm">Scholz</a> and Riezler, <em>infra</em>, bibliography). It seemed to those times that either <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or emperor must be supreme. The writers who defend the lay side are of many shades of feeling: Pierre du Bois (Wailly, "Summaria Brevis", 1849, "M&eacute;moires de l'Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions" etc., 435-94); <a href="09719c.htm">Marsilius of Padua</a> (Poole, "Illustrations of the History of Medi&aelig;val Thought", 276 <em>et passim</em>); <a href="15636a.htm">William of Ockham</a> (ibid. 260); <a href="15722a.htm">John Wycliff</a> (De civili dominio, 1 cap., 17 fol., 40, c., ibid. 284). Not merely do they protest against <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> interference, but, as a counterblast, endeavour to make the king or emperor &mdash; according as they defend <a href="12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, Edward I, or Louis of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> &mdash; take the most important place in the working of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> internal organism (cf. Baldus de Ubaldis, 1327-1400, in his "Consilia", 228, n. 7: <em>Imperator est dominus totius mundi et Deus in terra</em>, i.e. the emperor is lord of the whole world and <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> on earth).</p>

<p>Certain defenders of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> are no less vehement. They rightly forbid C&aelig;sar to meddle with matters within the spiritual sphere of life; but, not content with this, they endeavour to put the emperor directly under the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Augustinus Triumphus (De potestate ecclesiastica XXXVIII, 1, 224), and &AElig;gidius Colonna (De ecclesiastica potestate, II, 4) assert that all temporal rule comes ultimately from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, that he alone has the supreme plenitude of power, and that none can be absolved from his high <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. While these high claims, the inheritance of ages of universal <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> when the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> were really the saviours of popular liberties, were being thus set forth, the power of the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a> had <em>de facto</em> enormously increased. The theorizing of <a href="09719c.htm">Marsilius of Padua</a>, Ockham, and others led to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of unrestrained royal absolutism (Poole, loc. cit., 259). The German princes with their territorializing ideals, the French kings with their strong and efficient monarchy, and the English Tudor sovereigns no longer brooked interference from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> even in purely spiritual matters. The phrase of the Treaty of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648) <em>cujus regio ejus religio</em>, i.e. the religion of the prince is the religion of the land, sums up the secular reply to the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order.</p>

<p>After the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> had served, even in countries like <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> which did not adopt the new religion, the purpose of fettering <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> even more than before, the State had in actual practice put the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> under its heel. The State continued to claim, because it exercised, the power to interfere and rule in all matters, whether spiritual or temporal. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> claimed, though it no longer freely exercised, the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to independence, nay supremacy, in all matters affecting religion, and to be in some way the fountain of all temporal dominion (<a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Quodlibet", 12, Q. xiii, a. 19, ad 2um: <em>Reges sunt vasalli Ecciesi&oelig;</em>). Francisco Su&aacute;rez and later <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> certainly moderate the vehemence of Augustinus Tnumphus and his companions. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of course that the post-Tridentine writers expound what has been called "the indirect power" of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in civil affairs, while they curb in various ways the growing civil absolutism of the times. The name of sovereignty was withdrawn, but its substitute was suzerainty, which meant little less than the other (Figgis, "From Gerson to Grotius", VI, 181). Hence the undeniable tendency of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> to repeat in clear language the cases in which rulers may lawfully be <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Hence also their unqualified defence of popular <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. Says Filmer ("Patriarcha", I, i, 2, 1880) concerning the power of the people to deprive or correct the sovereign. "Cardinal <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a> both look asquint this way".</p>

<p>No <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> in this long controversy both <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and secular writers went too often to extremes. It is in the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> that each allows the other, that we must look for the more workable hypothesis. Thus when the lay writers describe the spiritual rule of the Papacy (<a href="04628a.htm">Dante</a>, "De Monarchia"; Ockham, "Octo Questiones", q. 1, c. 6, ad 2), they depict almost literally the position of a <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> or a <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, <a href="12473a.htm">prophesying</a> the greatness of such an office. And when the ecclesiastico-political writers sketch their theory of a state (Nicolas of Cusa, "Concordantia Catholica"; Schardius, "Syntagma"), directing, ordering, <a href="05295b.htm">educating</a> the free lives of free citizens, they are no less <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a> of a desirable order. Moreover <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> expressly declared that, for their execution in the temporal sphere, the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ideals depended no less than the lay ideals on the consent and custom of the people, in the absence of which the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> no longer claims to exercise power and <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, that public law and common consent once accorded to the <a href="12260a.htm">Supreme Judge of Christendom</a> for the common welfare (Discorso agli Accademici di Religione Catholica, 20 July, 1871).</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that in the past all <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> attempts to end <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> and decide between contending <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of disputing sovereigns, were really in the nature of arbitration. Popes like <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> never claimed to be the sources of temporal rule, or that whatever they did for the peace of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> was done by them as supreme temporal rulers; but only on the invitation or acceptance of the princes interested. Even <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> like <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and others, who exercised most fully their spiritual prerogatives, were unable to act efficiently as peacemakers, until they were called in by those at <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Historical cases of papal arbitration</h2>

<p>The various interpositions of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to allay the differences in <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> diplomacy, such as it then was, have been already alluded to. It will be better to pass at once to later historical examples.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>The <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> made frequent efforts to negotiate between the Kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> during the Hundred Years' War, but the most famous attempt is that of <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> in 1297. It came just after the controversy between <a href="12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> concerning the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Clericis laicos". Eventually <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a> gave up many of his earlier demands, partly through pressure from the French king, partly because he found that he had gone too far, partly in the interests of <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> peace. The more fully to achieve the latter purpose, he offered to arbitrate in the quarrel that had been further complicated by the alliance formed between the <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a> and the English. The Cardinal of <a href="01255b.htm">Albano</a> and Pr&aelig;neste was sent to Creil on 20 April, 1297. But the temper of French thought is expressed in the protest of King Philip that he would submit to arbitration as did Edward I and the Count of <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, but that he looked for nothing more than arbitration, not for recourse to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as to a higher <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> court. He laid down three propositions and completed them by a practical conclusion:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(a) The government of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> belonged solely to the king;</li><li>(b) the king recognized no temporal superior;</li><li>(c) he submitted his temporal affairs to no man living.</li></ul></div>

<p>Therefore he came to the Roman Court for arbitration, not as to <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> the supreme <a href="12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, but as to the lawyer Benedetto Gaetani. The terms of the arbitrament are not of present interest; this only should be noted, that <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a> placated the French king by deciding largely in his favour, to the disgust of the Count of <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, but issued his award in a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> (Lavisse, "Hist. de France" (Paris, 1901).</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>One of the first public acts of <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> was to effect a settlement between <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. These two nations had been foremost in undertaking voyages of discovery in the East and West. The result was, that as each expedition on landing annexed the new-found territories to its own home government, there was continual friction between the rival nations. In the interests of peace, <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> offered to arbitrate between the two countries. He issued his <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Inter C&aelig;tera," 14 May, 1493, fixing the line at meridian of 100 leagues west of the <a href="02168a.htm">Azores</a> and Cape Verde Islands &mdash; assumed to be practically of the same longitude &mdash; <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> to have the western, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the eastern division. The following year (7 June) by the treaty of Tordesillas the imaginary line was moved to 370 leagues west of Cape Verde. To this the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as arbitrator assented, and thus averted <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between the two countries ("Civilt&agrave; Cattolica", 1865, I, 665-80; Winsor, "History of America", 1886, I, 13, 592; "Cambridge Modern History", I, 23-24).</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>More curious examples are found in the invitation given to <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and later to <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> to arbitrate between <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> over Lithuania (Rombaud, "History of Russia", London, 1885). The success of this led to <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> being asked to settle the difference between Bathory of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and Ivan the Terrible. <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory</a> between 1572 and 1583 sent to <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a> the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="12317a.htm">Antonio Possevino</a>, who arranged peace between them. Ivan ceded Polotsk and all Livonia to the Poles ("Revue des Questions Historiques," Jan., 1885).</p>

<p>Perhaps the best-remembered case is that of 1885, when <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> was averted between <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> by the arbitration of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. It was over the question of the Caroline Islands, which though discovered by <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> had been practically abandoned for many years. <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> had presented a joint note to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, refusing to acknowledge her sovereignty over the Caroline and Palao group of islands. German colonists had been established there. But the climax was reached when on 25 August, 1885, both Spanish and German <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> vessels planted the flags of their respective countries and took solemn possession of Yap. On 24 September, <a href="16010b.htm">Bismarck</a>, out of compliment to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and to propitiate the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (Busch, "Life of Bismarck", 469-70, London, 1899), referred the matter to <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> gave his award on 22 October, succeeding perfectly in adjusting the conflicting claims of Spanish sovereignty and German interests. Finally the whole matter was amicably accepted and signed at the Vatican by both powers on 17 December of the same year (<a href="11293b.htm">O'Reilly</a>, "Life of Leo XIII", xxxiii, 537-54).</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Lastly, in 1897, the same pontiff arbitrated between <a href="07114a.htm">Hayti</a> and <a href="13463a.htm">San Domingo</a>. But the terms of his arbitration do not appear to have been published (Darby, "Proved Practicability of International Arbitration", London, 1904, 19). For the celebrated case of <a href="01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> and his gift of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to Henry II, see <a href="01156c.htm">ADRIAN IV</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Future</h2>

<p>The increasing movement of arbitration, growing stronger with each fresh exercise of it, together with the fact that owing to the action of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> have been excluded from the Hague Conference, makes the thought suggest itself of how far the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> is situated today to act as a general arbitrator:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(1) It has ceased to hold any territorial dominion and can therefore stand forward as an impartial judge unlikely to be affected by temporal interests.</li><li>(2) It has interests in too many lands to be likely to favour any one country at the expense of others.</li><li>(3) It is wholly international, and adaptable, because alive, to the various environments of temperament, customs, <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> languages, political constitutions, social organizations, in which it finds itself. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of each country are national in the sense of being patriotic; not in the sense of being separated in matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> from <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> elsewhere.</li><li>(4) It is ruled by a pontiff, ordinarily indeed Italian; but his group of advisers is a privy council drawn from every continent, race, and nation. So detached has he been, that it is precisely three <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> who have refused to acknowledge the Italian spoliation of the <a href="14257a.htm">Patrimony of St. Peter</a>.</li><li>(5) As the greatest <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> force in the modern world its whole influence must be heavily thrown into the scale of peace.</li><li>(6) It has about it a halo of past usefulness, touched about with the mellow hue of time.</li></ul></div>

<p>It has seemed to men so different as Leibniz (Opera, V, 65), Voltaire (Essais, II, ix), Ancillon (Tableau des Revolutions, I, 79, 106, Berlin, 1803), to have been set in a position not to dictate to, but to arbitrate for, the world. And because it has gone back to the older, simpler, more spiritual theories of Gelasius I, <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory I</a>, and <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> it has now opportunities which were denied it, so long as it claimed the more showy <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a>. Just as under <a href="12126c.htm">Pius II</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> created the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> Congress (Boulting, "&AElig;neas Sylvius," 279, 350-51, London, 1908), so it is to be hoped that under her presidency the practice of arbitration by a permanent tribunal may be made more universal, more practicable, and of greater sanction.</p>
