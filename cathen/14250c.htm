<p>The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the State are both perfect <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, that is to say, each essentially aiming at a common good commensurate with the need of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> at large and ultimate in a generic kind of life, and each juridically competent to provide all the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> and sufficient means thereto. The State is ethically demonstrated to be such, and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has a like demonstration from the <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation. By reason of coexistence on the earth, community of subjects, and a need in common of some of the same means of activity, it is inevitable that they should have mutual relations in the juridical order. To declare these relations in brief from an <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> viewpoint, which is the scope of the present article, it will be <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to state:</p>

<blockquote><p>I. The basis of their respective <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>; <br>II. The range of their respective jurisdictions; <br>III. Their mutual corporate relation; <br>IV. The union of Church and State; <br>V. Counter theories.</p></blockquote>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section1">The basis of rights</h2>

<p>All <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> on earth come ultimately from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> through the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine Law</a>, either natural or positive. The character of our natural <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> is determined by the purpose to which the Creator shaped the nature of man, and natural <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them is acquired by <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> from the aptitudes, tendencies, and needs of nature. Duties and <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> descending from positive <a href="09071a.htm">Divine Law</a> are determined by some additional purpose of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, over and above the exigencies of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>, and are to be learned only from Divine Revelation, either in its explicit declaration or its rational content. Man has one ultimate purpose of existence: eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> in a future life. But man also has a twofold proximate purpose: to earn his title to eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and to attain to a measure of temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> consistent with the prior proximate purpose. The State is a natural institution, whose powers, therefore, come from the <a href="09076a.htm">natural law</a> and are determined by the character of the natural purpose of the State plus whatever limitation <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has, because of qualifications in the last end of man, <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the Divine Positive Law. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is a positive institution of Christ the <a href="14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, whose powers, therefore, are derived from the Divine Positive Law and are determined by the nature of the purpose He has assigned to it, plus whatever further concession He has made to facilitate the accomplishment of that purpose. In any consideration of the mutual relations of Church and State the above propositions are fundamental.</p>

<p>The goal of the State is the temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of man, and its proximate purpose the preservation of external juridical order and the provision of a reasonable abundance of means of human development in the interests of its citizens and their posterity. Man himself however, as we have said, has a further goal of perfect <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> to be realized only after death, and consequently a proximate purpose to earn in this life his title to the same. In the pursuit of this latter purpose, speaking in the abstract, he had a natural right to constitute a social organization taking over the worship of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> as a charge peculiarly its own. In the concrete however, i.e., as a matter of fact, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> by positive law has vacated this natural right and established a universal <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> (the Church) for Divine worship and the securing of perfect <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the hereafter. <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, furthermore, has appointed for man a destiny which cannot be attained by mere natural means, and consequently <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has conceded to man additional means commensurate with this ultimate purpose, putting these means at the disposal of man through the ministration of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Finally, He has determined the form of external public worship to be rendered, centering it about a sacrifice, the efficacy of which is from itself, being, as it is, a repetition of the Sacrifice of Calvary. The goal, then, of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is the perfect <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of man; its proximate purpose, to safeguard the internal moral order of right and wrong; and its external manifestation, to care for Divine worship and minister to man the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> means of grace. The State, then, exists to help man to temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, to eternal. Of these two purposes the latter is more ultimate, man's greater good, while the former is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the acquisition of the latter. The dominating proximate purpose of man must be to earn his title to <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>: for that, if needs be, he must rationally sacrifice his temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. It is clear, therefore, that the purpose of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is higher in the order of <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> and of righteous human endeavour than that of the State. Hence, in case of direct collision of the two, <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> will and man's need require that the guardian of the lower purpose should yield. Likewise the argument for the extension of the powers of the higher <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> in a measure into the domain of the lower will not hold for such extension from the lower into the higher.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section2">The range of jurisdiction</h2>

<p>As there are many distinct States of equal natural right the subjects of each are restricted in number, and its government of them is practically confined within the limits of its own territory. Within this territory it has full power to govern them, defining their <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and in some cases restricting the exercise of these <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> conferring purely civil <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and imposing civil <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, holding its citizens to a proper condition of public morality, owning <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> and qualifying private ownership of the same--all within the exigencies of the civic purpose of preserving external juridical order and Promoting the prosperity of the citizens, and over all bound by the enactment of the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine Law</a>, both natural and positive. In a word, the State controls its own subjects, in the pursuit of its own natural end, in all things where a higher right does not stop it. A higher right will be a right existent because of an ulterior or a more essential destiny of man than the purpose which civil <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> pursues for him. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to preach the Gospel everywhere, willing or nilling any state authority, and so to secure the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of its members among the subjects of any civil polity whatever. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to govern her subjects wherever found, declaring for them moral right and wrong, restricting any such use of their <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> as might jeopardize their eternal welfare, conferring purely <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, acquiring and holding <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> herself, and empowering her subordinate associations to do the same--all within the limits of the requirements of her triple purpose, as laid down by the <a href="09071a.htm">Divine Positive Law</a>, of preserving the internal order of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> and its external manifestation, of providing adequate means of sanctification for her members, and of caring for Divine worship, and over all bound by the eternal principles of integrity and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> declared in the <a href="09076a.htm">natural</a> and <a href="09071a.htm">positive Law of God</a>.</p>

<p>In all purely temporal subject-matter, so long as it remains such, the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the State over its own subjects stands not only supreme, but, as far as the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is concerned, alone. Purely temporal matter is that which has a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> relation of help or hindrance to man's temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, the ultimate end of civil <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> or the State, in such wise that it is at the same time indifferent in itself as a help or hindrance to man's eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>. It is of two kinds: primarily it includes all <a href="01115a.htm">human acts</a> so related, and secondarily <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> or external things as far as they are involved in such acts. In all purely spiritual subject-matter, so long as it remains such, the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> over her <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> subjects obtains to the complete exclusion of the State; nor is the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> therein juridically dependent in any way upon the State for the exercise of its legitimate powers. Purely spiritual subject-matter is primarily made up of <a href="01115a.htm">human acts</a> necessarily related as help or hindrance to man's eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, the last end of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and at the same time indifferent in themselves as a help or hindrance to man's temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>; secondarily it extends to all <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> and external objects as involved in such acts. In all subject-matter not purely spiritual nor purely temporal, but at the same time both spiritual and temporal in character, both jurisdictions may enter, and so entering give occasion to collision, for which there must be a principle of solution. In case of direct contradiction, making it impossible for both jurisdictions to be exercised, the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> prevails, and that of the State is excluded. The reason of this is obvious: both authorities come from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in fulfillment of his purposes in the life of man: He cannot contradict Himself; He cannot authorize contradictory powers. His real will and concession of power is determined by the higher purpose of His Providence and man's need, which is the eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of man, the ultimate end of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In view of this end <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> concedes to her the only authority that can exist in the case in point.</p>

<p>In a case where there is no direct contradiction but a possibility of both jurisdictions being exercised without hurt to the higher, though neither <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is voided, and they both might, absolutely speaking, be exercised without mutual consultation, practically there is a clear opening for some adjustment between the two, since both jurisdictions are interested in avoiding friction. Though <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a> were not devised precisely for this purpose, they have in many cases been used for such adjustment (see <a href="04196a.htm">CONCORDAT</a>). Consistently with the superiority of essential purpose indicated above, the judicial decision as to when a question does or does not involve spiritual matter, either purely or in part, rests with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. It cannot lie with the State, whose <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, because of the inferiority of its ultimate end and proximate purpose, has not such judicial faculty in regard to the subject-matter of a <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which is as far above its own as the ultimate end and proximate purpose thereof is above that of the State. In analogous fashion every higher court is always judge of its own <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> as against a lower.</p>

<p>All the above is matter of principle, argued out as a question of objective right, and it supposes that the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is to be applied through the respective subjects of the same. In point of fact the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of submission in a citizen of a State to the higher <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> does not exist where the citizen is not a subject of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, for over such the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> claims no governing power. It may also be by accident subjectively obscured in one who, though in point of right the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> subject, in <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a> fails, through an <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, to recognize this fact, and, by consequence, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> right and his own <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>. The subject of the State has been made fairly clear by human law and custom; but the frequent rebellion, continued through centuries, of great numbers of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> subjects has confused in the mind of the non-Catholic world the notion of who is by revealed law a subject of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The juridical subject of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is every human being that has validly received the <a href="02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>. This birth into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> is analogous to the birth within the territory of a State of the off spring of one of its citizens. However, this newborn subject of the State can, under certain circumstances, renounce his allegiance to his native State and be accepted as the subject of another. Not so one born into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>: for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> is a sacrament leaving an indelible character upon the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, which man cannot remove and so escape legitimate subjection. Yet, as in a State, a man may be a subject without full <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of citizenship; may even, while remaining a subject, lose those <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> by his own act or that of his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>; so, analogously, not every subject of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is a member thereof, and once a member, he may lose the social <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of membership in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> without ceasing to be its subject. For full membership in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, besides valid <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one must by union of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and allegiance be in fellowship with her, and not be deprived of the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of membership by <a href="03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censure</a>. Hence, those validly <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> who live in <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> or, whether by reason of apostasy or of initial <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, profess a <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> different from that of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, or are <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> therefrom, are not members of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, though as a matter of objective <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> they are still her subjects. In practice the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, while retaining her right over all subjects, does not--except in some few matters not of moment here--insist upon exercising her <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over any but her members, as it is clear that she cannot expect obedience from those <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> who, being in <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> or government separated from her, see no right in her to command, and consequently recognize no <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to obey. Over those who are not <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> she claims no <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to govern, though she has the indefeasible right to preach the Gospel among them and to endeavour to win them over to become members of <a href="03744a.htm">Christ's Church</a> and so citizens of her <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> polity.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Mutual corporate relation of Church and state</h2>

<p>Every perfect <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> must acknowledge the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of every other perfect <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>; must render to it all <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> consequent upon such <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>; must respect its autonomy; and may demand the recognition of its own <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and the fulfilment of <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> arising therefrom. Whether one may also command such recognition and fulfilment is another question: one does not involve the other; thus, for instance, the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> may demand its <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, but cannot command <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to acknowledge them, as the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> has no authority over <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> or any other nation. Prescinding from this for the moment, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> must respect the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State to govern its subjects in all purely temporal matters, and, if the subjects of the State are likewise subjects of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, must hold the latter to the fulfilment of their civil <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> as an <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> in <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>. On the other hand, in principle, as a matter of objective <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, the State is bound to recognize the juridical <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in all matters spiritual whether purely so or of mixed character, and its judicial right to determine the character of matters of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, in regard, namely, to their spiritual quality. The State, furthermore, is bound to render due worship to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, as follows from the same argument from the <a href="09076a.htm">natural law</a> which <a href="12454c.htm">proves</a> man's <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to external worship, namely, that man must acknowledge his dependence upon <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and his subjection to Him in every capacity in which he is so dependent, and therefore not only in his private capacity as an individual but also in that public, corporate capacity whereby he and his fellow citizens constitute the State. Due worship, in the present economy, is that of the religion of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, entrusted to the care of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The State must also protect the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the exercise of her functions, for the reason that the State is bound to protect all the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of its citizens, and among these their religious <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, which as a matter of fact would be insecure and fruitless were not the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> protected. The State is even under <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to promote the spiritual interests of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; for the State is bound to promote whatever by reaction naturally works for the moral development of its citizens and consequently for the internal peace of the community, and in the present condition of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> that development is necessarily dependent upon the spiritual influence of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>There being, then, an <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> upon the State as such, arising out of the Natural and the Divine Positive Law, to render public Divine worship in accordance with the guidance of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, in whose charge Christ has placed the worship due in the present order of things, an <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> also to protect the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and to promote her interests, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> clearly has a perfect right to demand the fulfilment of these <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, since their neglect would infringe her right to the benefit proceeding from the fulfilment. To have the further right to command the State in their regard implies that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to impose the <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of her authority in their regard, to exact them authoritatively from the State. Now in purely temporal matters, while they remain such, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot command the State any more than she can command the subjects of the State, even though these are at the same time her own subjects. But in spiritual and mixed matters calling for corporate action of the State, the question depends upon whether the physical <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who make up the moral <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> of the State are themselves subjects of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In case they are, then the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has in consequence <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> therein over the State. The reason is that owing to the supremacy in <a href="09580c.htm">man's</a> life purposes of his eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, man in all his capacities, even of a civil nature, must direct his activities so that they shall not hinder this end, and where action even in his official or civil capacity is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this ultimate purpose he is bound to place the action: moreover, in all these activities so bearing on this end, since they are thereby spiritual matter, every subject of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. If, then, the physical <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> constituting the moral <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of the State are the subjects of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, they are still, in this joint capacity, subject to her in like matters, namely, in the fulfilment of all civil <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the State towards religion and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, because of the uselessness of her insistence, or because of greater evils to be so avoided, may waive the exercise of this <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; but in principle it is hers.</p>

<p>In practice we distinguish, from a religious point of view, four kinds of <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a>.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>First, in a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> State, in which, namely, the physical <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> constituting the moral <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> of the State are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in matters of her competency is in every way complete.</li><li>Secondly, in a non-Christian State, for instance that of the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>, where the constituency is not even <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> claims no <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the State as such: the foundation of such <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is lacking.</li><li>Third, in a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> but non-Catholic State, where the constituency, though by <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> subjects, are not members of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, <em>per se</em> the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> would stand, but <em>per accidens</em> its exercise is impossible.</li><li>Fourth, a mixed State, one, namely, the constituents of whose moral <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> are necessarily of diverse <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a>, practically lies outside the reach of <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, since the affiliation of some of the constituents could not make a subject of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> out of the moral <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> constitutionally made up of elements not all of which share such affiliation. The subordination here indicated is indirect: not that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> does not directly reach spiritual and mixed matters, but that in their regard it <em>directly</em> reaches only its immediate subjects, and <em>indirectly</em>, through them, the State which they constitute.</li></ul></div>

<p>Again, the State as such does not in such matters directly act for the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> purpose of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (the eternal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of its subjects), but for its own temporal purpose inasmuch as such action will make for their temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and so it acts for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by indirection.</p>

<p>There is no parallel argument to give the State indirectly <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in matters purely temporal, and therefore of the State's sole competency. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is universal and cannot be a member or subject of any particular State. Even were there but one universal State in the world, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> would not be a member thereof, for its members are not citizens of the State to the extent that in every capacity they must submit their activities for the purpose of the State, particularly not the activities concerned directly with the higher purpose of eternal life. Moreover, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is not constituted merely by the exercise of the natural <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the men who are citizens of the State, but by the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> endowment of the Divine Positive Law. Finally, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in its corporate capacity is not bound to seek the temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of her members as a means to their eternal welfare, while the State as such is bound to Divine worship and to the protection and promotion of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the interests of religion, because this is a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> element involved in the perfect temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> citizen. The State, therefore, has not, either in temporal or in spiritual things, any authority over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as such, however much it may have in things purely temporal over the members of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, who are subjects of the State. The State can, as was said above, demand its <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>: it cannot command them.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Union of Church and state</h2>

<p>There is some confusion in the public mind about the meaning of the union of Church and State. The essential <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of such union is a condition of affairs where a State recognizes its natural and <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> relation to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, professes the Faith, and practises the worship of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, protects it, enacts no <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> to its hurt, while, in case of necessity and at its instance taking all just and requisite civil measures to forward the Divinely appointed purpose of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>--in so far as all these make for the State's own essential purpose, the temporal <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of its citizens. That this is in principle the normal and ethically proper condition for a truly <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> State should be evident from the religious <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> State as above declared. That in practice it has in the past sometimes worked <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> to both Church and State, is an accidental effect consequent upon the frailty and passion of the human instruments then ruling in Church, or in State, or in both. As a partial attempt at security against such <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> consequences, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has for centuries established <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a> with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> States; but even these have not always saved the situation. For <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a>, like all other agreements, however firm in principle, are in practice only as strong as the conscientiousness of those whose <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to observe them. The conscienceless can destroy them at pleasure. Between the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and a non-Christian or a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but non-Catholic, State a condition of separation, as meaning a condition of indifference of the State towards the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, is to be expected, as the foundation of the specific <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> involved in union are wanting. Such a separation for a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> State would be criminal, as ignoring the sacred <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the State.</p>

<p>For a State once <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and in union with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to declare a separation on the ground that it has ceased to be <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is an action which as a matter of objective right has no standing; for in objective <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of the people would be to regain their lost <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, if they had really lost it, or to live up to it if in reality it were not lost. But on the supposition that the essential constituency of a State has been transformed from <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to those who, not by <a href="07610a.htm">hypocritical</a> pretence, but in the fulness of <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a>, are not <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>--a condition easier of supposition than of realization--the State through such mistaken <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> might seek for separation without subjective fault, provided the separation were effected without the summary dissolution of existing contracts, without the violation of vested <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or its members. It may be noted in passing that in the recent instances of separation in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, i.e., the breaking up of an existing condition of union between Church and State, the separation has been effected where the bulk of the people is still <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, has been conducted in violation of <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and contracts both natural and positive, and has resulted, as it was aimed to do, in an attempt at complete subsection of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and of all civil subjects in the matters of religion to the tyranny of administrations which scoff at all religion. That in States whose <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> is constitutionally made up of every complexion of religious <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, much of it in its diversity sincere, there should be a governmental abstention from any specific denominational worship or profession of <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>, and a general protection and encouragement of the individual in the practice of religion according to his own religious principles within the limits of the <a href="09076a.htm">Natural Law</a>, or of a general acceptance of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, seems a practical necessity of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> times, when unity of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> is so widely lacking, and a <em>modus vivendi</em> which, if sincerely carried out, seems to work as little harm to objective right as can be expected in a condition of consciences sincerely differing in the matter of right established by the Divine Positive Law.</p>

<h2>Counter theories</h2>

<p>The theories opposed to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position on the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> relations between the Church and State are threefold, differing in latitude of negation of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="13055c.htm">right</a>.</p>

<h3 id="A">Absolute Liberalism</h3>

<p>Absolute <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> is the most extreme. Having its source in the principles of the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and beginning with those who denied the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, it naturally takes the position that the State prescinds from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>: the State, it says, is <a href="02040a.htm">atheistic</a>. Undertaking, with the elimination of revelation and the Divine Positive Law, to get back to purely natural principles, it accepted from Rousseau and the <a href="15241c.htm">Utilitarians</a> the principle that all right comes from the State, all authority from the consentient wills of the people of the State. The position <a href="09324a.htm">logically</a> followed that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has no <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>--not even the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to existence--save such as are conceded to it by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>. Hence it is not a perfect <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, but a creature of the State, upon which it depends in all things, and upon which it must be directly subordinate, if it is to be allowed to exist at all. (See <a href="09212a.htm">LIBERALISM</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="B">Qualified Liberalism</h3>

<p>Qualified <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, as formulated by Cavour and Minghetti in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the close of the first half of the nineteenth century, does not go so far. While claiming to admit that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is more or less a perfect <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> with foundations in the Divine Positive Law of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation, it contends that the Church and State are disparate in such fashion as to prosecute their respective ends independently in behalf of the individual, having no subordination whatever one to the other. Consequently, in all public affairs the State must prescind from every religious <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, and deal with such either as private associations existing within the State or as foreign corporations to be treated with accordingly. The axiom of this newer <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> is "A free <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in a free State", which in point of fact means an emasculated Church with no more freedom than the shifting politics, internal and external, of a State chose to give, which in the event, as was to be foreseen, amounted to servitude. (See <a href="08208a.htm">ITALY</a>: <em>Political and Civil Government: Church and State</em>.)</p>

<h3 id="C">Regalism</h3>

<p>The Theory of the Regalists conceded to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> a certain amount of social right from its Divine Founder, but conditioned the exercise of all social powers upon the consent of the civil government. This theory, originating with Gallicanism, practically denied the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to be a perfect <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> inasmuch as it made its <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> depend for its valid exercise upon the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>. The theory gradually extended its contentions so far as to make the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> indirectly subordinate to the State, attributing to the State the authority to forbid the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> any juridical act that might work to the detriment of the State and to command the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in case of necessity to put forth her full powers to promote the interests of the State.</p>
