<p><a href="14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. at Igersheim (W&uuml;rtemberg), 6 April, 1796; d. at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 12 April, 1838. The gifted youth first studied in the gymnasium at Mergentheim, and then attended the lyceum at <a href="05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, where he applied himself primarily to <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies. In 1815 he turned to the study of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and, after leaving the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> college at <a href="05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, went to T&uuml;bingen to continue his studies in the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> there under the learned professors Drey and Hirscher. In 1818 he entered the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a> on the Neckar, was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> on 18 September, 1819, and was sent as <a href="04570a.htm">curate</a> in charge to Weilderstadt and then to Riedlingen. In 1821 he became <em>Repetent</em> (tutor) in the Wilhelmstift at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, and for more than a year devoted himself almost exclusively to classical literature, particularly to earlier Greek history and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In this way he acquired the keenness and clearness of judgment, delicacy of diction, skill in exposition, and line sense of the &aelig;sthetic which distinguish all his writings and discourses. Soon, the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> offered him a place as tutor <em>(Privatdozent)</em> in <a href="07365a.htm">church history</a>, to prepare for which he visited the leading German and Austrian <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, meeting there the best-known <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> and pedagogues &#151; Niemeyer, Gesenius, Planck, Schleiermacher, Marheineke, and in particular Neander, who made a powerful impression on the young man.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Thus equipped, he began his lectures, and soon published his first book under the title "Die Einheit in der Kirche oder das Prinzip des Katholizismus, dargestellt im Geiste der Kirchenvater der drei ersten Jahrhunderte" (T&uuml;bingen, 1825). It was hailed with enthusiasm, and gave brilliant evidence of the profound <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the remarkable penetration of the young scholar. He was indeed a child of his time, and betrayed certain <a href="06023a.htm">Febronian</a> views and some sympathy with the pseudo-reformism of the day, which the <a href="07276c.htm">Hermesians</a> later cast up to him, and which he often regretted. His book, nevertheless, was not merely a highly <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, but also a highly moral act, and that for many readers, like <a href="03640a.htm">Chateaubriand's</a> "G&eacute;nie du christianisme". Through the whole work there breathes, as it were, a new spirit, "which seems to herald a rejuvenescence of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a>". There is here no shallowness or special pleading: one hears the accents of fresh living, full <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, such as the author's profound study of the church Fathers had revealed to him. For him the church unity is twofold in character: a unity of spirit and a unity of body. The former isle first, the mystical unity in the Holy Spirit which binds all the faithful in one communion; then the <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> unity of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, i.e., the comprehensive expression of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> mind in opposition to the manifold forms of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and finally unity in multiplicity, i.e., the preservation of individuality within the unity of all the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The unity of the body of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> reveals itself first in the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in whom is visible the unity of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; to this correspond the wider circles of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> system and the council of the entire episcopate, and finally the Roman primacy, whose gradual development M&ouml;hler illustrates from the history of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity and of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Immediately after the appearance of his book M&ouml;hler was offered a place in the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>; he refused it, and as a result was appointed extraordinary professor at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> in 1826. After he had, two years later, declined another offer from <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, he became at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> ordinary professor in the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, which conferred on him the Doctorate of Theology. Not long before he had published his second work: "Athanasius der Grosse und die Kirche seiner Zeit im Kamfe mit dem Arianismus" (Mainz, 1827). It is a pleasing lively portrait of the great <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Alexandria, the champion of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> amid the great <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conflicts of the fourth century. He portrays him the hero of his time, with a character that contrasts favourably with the gloomy attitude of Arius and the validating weakness of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>. About the same time (T&uuml;bingen theologische Quartalschift, 1827-8) he depicted in a similar masterly way one of the great figures of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a>, as <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, scholar, and defender of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> liberty.</p>

<p>His study of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life in early and <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> times led naturally to an examination of the distinctive differences between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The results of his investigation he published in "Betrachtungen &uuml;ber den Zustand der Kirche im funfzehuten und zu Anfang des sechzehnten Jahrhunderts" (Gesammelte Schrfften, II, 1-34). He concludes that the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, really <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the sixteenth century, did not take place in the right way, but took on rather the character of an entirely revolutionary movement, by which the tranquil development of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church, with all its good elements, was disturbed and an end put to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity. In connexion with these investigations he began &#151; as he had seen done in the North German <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> and as his <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> colleague at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, Professor Baur, had done &#151; lectures on the antithesis between <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, or, as is usually said, on symbolism. By this term are meant, in this connexion, the distinctive notes of a given <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communion, also certain set formulae, legally <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and in a general way expressive of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> or of certain fundamental dogmatic <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>; or again, especially since the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> (or rasher since the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries), the confessions of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> that constitute the form or rule of <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> for the faithful of any <a href="13674a.htm">religious denomination</a>. In this way symbolism, being the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of creeds, is a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a> that com pares one religious system with another on the basis of their creeds, and thus demonstrates the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> or <a href="05781a.htm">falsity</a> of a particular creed. While symbolisms &#151; as it is now usually called, comparative symbolism &#151; has not long been recognized as a special <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a>, there are traces of it even in earliest <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> times. The <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> created the conditions amid which it grew to maturity; and its first representative was probably the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> professor, Leonhard Rechtenbach, in his "Encyclopedia symbolica" (Leipzig, 1612). It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that, in his opinion, the office of symbolism was merely to make one acquainted with one's own symbolic books, without paying any attention to those of another denomination. The founder of scientific symbolism in its modern sense was the. G&ouml;ttingen Professor Planck in his "Abriss einer historischen und vergleichenden Darstellung der dogmatischen Stesteme unserer verschiedenen christlichen Hauptpatheien" (G&ouml;ttingen, 1796), the first effort at real comprehension of all <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> creeds in their distinctive characteristics. Marheineke went farther in his "Christliche Symbolik oder historisch-kritische und dogmatische komparative Darstellung des katholischen, lutherischen, reformiecrten, und socinianischen Lehrbegriffes" (Heidelberg, 1810-13). Planck and Marheineke have found imitators, though of importance, who continue down to the most times to treat this from the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> standpoint.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>For <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> such studies had naturally had less attraction. When a student at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, M&ouml;hler had heard lectures on symbolism, and had late met many <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>. He was the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writer to develop this <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, and became the founder of his <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> through his classical work, "Symbolik oder Darstellung der dog matischen Gegens&auml;tze der Katholiken und Protestanten nach ihren &ouml;ffentliehen bekenntnissehriften" (Mainz, 1832; 13th ed., 1904). He demonstrated that there could be no incompatibility between what was truly rational and what was truly <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, both finding their sole, direct, and entirely adequate expression in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>. He showed also how <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> held the middle course between the extremes of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, e.g., between a supernaturalism pietism that denied the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of reason, and a <a href="10713a.htm">naturalism</a> and <a href="12652a.htm">rationalism</a> that rejected absolutely the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. With great clearness he exhibited the contradiction between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> principles; for instance, in the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> anthropology. On this basis he <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that other differences of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> regarding the Fall of Man, the Redemption, the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and even the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, were only <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> consequences of the anthropological views of the leaders of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Contradictory as it may seem, it was M&ouml;hler's ironic nature that impelled him to publish this work. He was persuaded that a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the real character of great religious conflict, based on the genuine and original documents, was a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> preliminary to any definite appeal to the tribunal of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. Such investigations seemed to him important, not only for <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, but also for every <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> scholar, the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> being nowhere so important as in matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. The work was enthusiastically received, and went through five editions in six years. An English translation by <a href="13099a.htm">James Burton Robertson</a> appeared in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> in 1843 under the title "Symbolism; or Exposition of Doctrinal Differences between Catholics and Protestants, as evidenced lay their Symbolical Writings" (reprint, <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> and New York, 1894), and the work was also translated into French and Italian. "What many had thought and felt, but could not clearly understand, much less adequately express, was brought out M&ouml;hler with marvellous insight and in the clearest Way" (Kihn). His German diction was also perfect.</p>

<p>The "Symbolik" acted like an electric spark, and stirred up many both in and out of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Naturally, <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> took up the gauntlet. Marheineke replied with moderation in his work, "Ueber Dr. J. A. M&ouml;hlers Symbolik" (Berlin, 1833), and Nitzch in his "Eine protestantische Beantwortung der Symbolik Dr. M&ouml;hlers" (Hamburg, 1835). On the other hand his T&uuml;bingen colleague, Professor Baur, abused M&ouml;hler in a prolix rejoinder, "Der Gegensatz Des Katholicismus und Protestantismus, nach den Principien und Hauptdogmen der beiden Lehrbegriffe. Mit besonderer R&uuml;cksicht auf Dr. M&ouml;hlers Symbolik" (T&uuml;bingen, 1834). M&ouml;hler replied with "Neue Untersuchungen der Lehrgegens&auml;tze zwisehen den und Protestanten. Eine Verteidigung meiner Symbolik gegen die Kritik des Herrn Prof. D. Baur" (T&uuml;bingen, 1834; 5th ea., with introduction and notes by Sehanz, Ratisbon, 1900), to which Baur replied in the same year. In his reply M&ouml;hler was able to state with greater clearness certain points difference, and to deal more profoundly certain <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> and criticisms. These additions were edited anew by <a href="12634a.htm">Raich</a> in "Erg&auml;nzungen zu M&ouml;hlers Symbolik aus dessen Sehrift: Neue Unterschungen" <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 1889; latest ed., 1906). This controversy with Baur made T&uuml;bingen disagreeable to M&ouml;hler, and he decided to seek some other academic centre. The <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government sought to attract the celebrated <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at one its <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>. Negotiations were begun and M&ouml;hler was not unwilling to go to Bonn. But <a href="07276c.htm">Professor Hermes</a>, who had Archbishop Spiegel on his side, prevented the execution of this design. <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, his intimate friend, was meanwhile active in his behalf at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and through his influence M&ouml;hler was appointed to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at that <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> to lecture on the <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.</p>

<p>He began at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> with lectures on the Epistle to the Romans, but in the next term he added lectures on <a href="07365a.htm">Church history</a> and petrology. His intercourse with professors of like mind raised his spirits, and his health, which had failed at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, improved. He devoted himself with fervour to the preparation of a history of monasticism, with the intention of setting forth the immeasurable influence of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> on Western civilization. While he cherished a warm attachment for the sons of St. Benedict, he was of opinion that the <a href="14096a.htm">suspension of the Society of Jesus</a> was not, historically speaking, to be regretted. His plan, however, was never realized. After a mild attack of cholera in 1836, he was stricken with a pulmonary ailment which compelled him to cease lecturing and seek health or alleviation at Meran in the Tyrol. After the condemnation of <a href="07276c.htm">Hermesianism</a> by <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government sought again to secure M&ouml;hler for Bonn, hoping perhaps that this would help to allay the controversies that had arisen at Cologne. His <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of peace, however, and his delicate health <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to refuse. Early in 183S the Icing of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> bestowed on him the <a href="10272a.htm">Order of St. Michael</a>, and on 22 March made him dean of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Wurzburg. M&ouml;hler never took up this office, however, for he died a few weeks later in the prime of life, not yet forty-two years of age, deeply lamented by king and people, regretted by his friends and by an who <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> him. A monument, subscribed for by almost an <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, adorns his grave in the cemetery at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, with the inscription. "Defensor fidei, literarum decus, ecclesiae solamen" (Defender of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, ornament of letters, consolation of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>). The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> erected another monument to his memory at his birthplace, at the dedication of which in 1880 his disciple and successor in T&uuml;bingen, Bishop Hefele of <a href="13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>, paid a noble tribute to his fame.</p>

<p>M&ouml;hler, as Kihn has well shown, had an uncommonly attractive <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>. He was an ideal <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, almost perfect in stature and comeliness, deeply <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and of childlike modesty, with a heart full of affection and gentleness, penetrated with the desire for peace in personal intercourse and for the restoration of harmony between the different creeds. He exercised a peculiar fascination over all who approached him, and men of every <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> and party confidently turned to him on all manner of questions. He charmed his hearers by his dignified bearing, his kindly, intelligent eye, his classic diction, and his ripe <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. It may be said that he gave new life to the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; also, and thus is greater praise, that he reawakened the religious spirit of the age. He was, in the judgment of a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> (Realencyklopadie fur prot. Theol., 2nd ed., IX, 662 sqq.), an epoch-making mind and a brilliant light of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; while, according to the same writer, the Evangelical Church, to which he owed much had to thank him for fresh stimulus and for what it learned from his fine, keen exposition of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> development. After his death <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> edited most of his minor writings in "Gesammelte Schriften und Aufs&auml;tze" (2 vols., Ratisbon, 1839-40). They are numerous, the most noteworthy being "Beleuchtung der Denksehrift fur die Aufhebung des den katholischen Geistliehen vorzeschriebenen Colibates", in which he refutes width great earnestness the opponents of <a href="03481a.htm">priestly celibacy</a>, and proves the sublimity of the virginal life from the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, from reason, and from the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Other important studies are: "Hieronymus and Augustin im Streit &uuml;ber Galater 2, 14" (I, l sqq.), "Ueber den Brief an Diognetus" (I, 19 sqq.), "Fragmente aus und &uuml;ber Pseudoisidor" (I. 283 sac.). ripe fruits of his studies of the Fathers and <a href="07365a.htm">Church history</a>. He was always greatly devoted to such studies, and in his lectures often drew attention to the literary treasures of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity. To him they stood as the unbroken series of witnesses to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, worship, and constitution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> &#151; the successive evidences of her many victories, as he puts it in the introduction to his "Patrologie oder christlichen Liter&auml;rgeschichte", the first volume of which, dealing with the first three centuries, was edited by Reithmayr with additions of his own (Ratisbon, 1840). Less important is the "Kommentar &uuml;ber den R&ouml;merbrief" (Ratisbon, 1845), also edited by Reithmayr after M&ouml;hler's death; it is difficult to say how much of it is M&ouml;hler's own work. The same may be said of the "Kirchengeschichte von J. A. M&ouml;hler" (3 vols., Ratisbon, 1887-8, index vol., 1870), laboriously compiled from class notes by the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="06376a.htm">Pius Gams</a>, and later translated into French.</p>
