<p>CHARLES-FORBES-REN&Eacute;, COMTE DE MONTALEMBERT.</p>

<p>Born in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, 15 April, 1810; died in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> 13 March, 1870. His father, Marc Ren&eacute;, had fought in the army of Cond&eacute;, and had afterwards served in an English cavalry regiment; he was chosen by the Prince Regent of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to announce to Louis XVIII the Restoration of the French monarchy, and he became, under the Restoration plenipotentiary minister of Stuttgart, and, later, to Stockholm. His maternal grandfather, James Forbes, belonged to a very old Scotch <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and had made many important journeys to <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>, which he related in the four volumes of his "Oriental Memoirs", published in 1813; he also wrote in 1810 a volume entitled "Reflections on the character of the Hindus and the necessity of converting them to Christianity".</p>

<p>Montalembert's mother, converted by Abb&eacute; Busson and P&agrave;re MacCarthy, made her <a href="01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> to Cardinal de Latil in 1822. The early years of Montalembert's life were passed in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; afterwards he studied at the Lyc&eacute;e Bourbon and at the Coll&agrave;ge Sainte-Barbe at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where out of twenty pupils in the sixteenth year of their age hardly one was a practical <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. At Sainte-Barbe young Montalembert made a friend of L&eacute;on Cornudet, who was also a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and the letters the boys exchanged in their seventeenth year have remained famous. At that early age Montalembert wrote: "Would it not be a splendid thing to show that religion is the mother of liberty!", a phrase which was to become the motto of his whole life. In 1829 he wrote to Rio: "my age, my tastes, my future call me to support the new ideal; but my religious <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and moral emotions cause me to lament bitterly the bygone days, the ages of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and self-sacrifice. If <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> is to triumph it must have liberty as its ally and tributary subject". Soon after its establishment in 1829 by Carn&eacute;, Cazal&agrave;s, and Augustin de Meaux, with the motto (borrowed from Canning): "Civil and Religious Liberty for the whole world", the review "Le Correspondant" had Montalembert as a contributor. In September and October, 1830, he travelled in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where he met O'Connell; he was thinking of assisting the cause for which O'Connell was struggling by writing a history of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, when he learned that the House of Commons had passed the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Emancipation Act.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>While he was in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> he received the prospectus of the new paper "L'Avenir", founded in October, 1830, by <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>. On 26 Oct., 1830, he wrote to <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>: "All that I <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>, and all that I am able to do I lay at your feet". On 5 November, 1830, he met <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and on 12 November at <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais's</a> house he met <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>. At times, Montalembert had to smooth over some of the risky things <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> allowed himself to be led into writing against the royalists in the paper; on the other hand he was engaged in controversy with <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, whose <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of aristocracy and the past glory of the French nobles he considered too narrow. It was Montalembert who, the day after the sack of St. Germain l'Auxerrois by the <a href="11480c.htm">Parisian</a> mob, published in "L'Avenir" an eloquent article on the Cross of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "which has ruled over the destinies of the modern world." He especially distinguished himself in "L'Avenir" by his campaigns in favour of freedom for <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and for these he received the congratulations of Victor Hugo and Alfred de Vigny. In 1831 he thought of going to <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and joining the insurgents. When the "Agence g&eacute;n&eacute;rale pour la d&eacute;fense de la libert&eacute; religieuse" (Central committee for the safeguarding of religious liberty), founded by the editors of "L'Avenir", had solemnly declared <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> on the monopoly of the French University by opening a primary <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> (9 May, 1831), Montalembert was indicted. As at this time by his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> death on 20 June, 1831, he became a peer of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, he demanded that he be tried by the House of Peers; and the famous "Free School Case" was heard before that assembly, 19 and 20 September, 1831.</p>

<p>The speech delivered by Montalembert on that occasion was a gem of eloquence. The trial ended in his condemnation to a fine of one hundred francs; but his eloquence succeeded in calling public attention to the question of freedom of teaching, which was destined not to be solved until 1850. When the last number of "L'Avenir" appeared (15 November, 1831), Montalembert accompanied <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> and <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. While in March, 1832, <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> divined the wishes of <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, and returned to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, Montalembert persisted in remaining in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>, who insisted on a public decision by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> concerning "L'Avenir". It was not until July that they left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Mirari Vos", which overtook them at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, was a <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a> of great sorrow to them. Montalembert submitted at once, and when early in 1833 <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> announced his intention of again taking up his editorial work, excepting the field of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and concerning himself only with social and political questions, Montalembert did all he could to dissuade him from so imprudent a step. When <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> by his <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 5 October 1833, found fault with the "long and violent preface" Montalembert had written for <a href="10283a.htm">Mickiewicz's</a> "Livre des P&eacute;lerins Polonais" and when at the end of that same year <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> broke away from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, Montalembert passed through a period of much sorrow, during which the advice of <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> helped him greatly. He tried in 1834 to dissuade <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> from publishing Les Paroles d'un Croyant", and in vain besought him to submit to the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Singulari nos" of 7 July, 1834. He submitted to all <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory's</a> decisions (8 December, 1834) and his correspondence with <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> ceased definitely in 1836.</p>

<p>In 1836 he published his "Vie de Saint Elizabeth de Hongrie" which restored <a href="07106b.htm">hagiography</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and brought back to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> a taste for the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> as shown in the lives of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. On 16 August, 1836, <a href="06470b.htm">Abb&eacute; Gerbet</a> blessed his marriage with Mlle de M&eacute;rode, daughter of the Felix de M&eacute;rode who had taken such an important part in the insurrection of the <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> against the government of the Low Countries, and who was descended from <a href="05389a.htm">Saint Elizabeth of Hungary</a>. She was the sister of Xavier de M&eacute;rode, afterwards minister of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>.</p>

<p>In the House of Peers, Montalembert took <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> in presenting himself as a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> first of all, at a time when as he himself wrote, "to profess or defend the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> one had to face marked unpopularity". In May, 1837, he spoke in favour of the right of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to own <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>; in Dec., 1838, when <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> burial had been refused to Montlosier by Bishop F&eacute;ron of <a href="04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, he replied in the name of liberty of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to those who assailed this purely <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> act. He seconded with all his influence the re-establishment of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> by <a href="07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a>, and of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> by <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, and in 1841 he obtained from Martin du Nord, Minister of Worship, permission for <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> to wear his monastic dress in the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of Notre Dame. "L'Univers Religieux", a daily paper founded in 1834 by Abb&eacute; <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, owed its solvency in 1838 to pecuniary <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> made by Montalembert, and it soon passed into the hands of <a href="15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a>. In June, 1845 Montalembert questioned the government concerning the measures it was about to take against the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and a few days later, when the concessions made by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to Rossi, whom Guizot had sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had brought about the partial dispersion of the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, he loudly expressed his surprise and sorrow. "You are our father, our support, our friend", wrote <a href="12667b.htm">P&egrave;re de Ravignan</a> to him. In the House he, moreover, defended the interests of foreign <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; in 1845, at the time of the Lebanon massacres, he questioned Guizot as to what <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> was doing to protect <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the East; in 1846 he questioned him concerning the massacres committed by <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> in Galicia, and the cruelties practised against the Poles of that province; on 11 January, 1848, he enthusiastically praised the hopes <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> held out to the Italian people, and reproached the government of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> for the lukewarm support it gave the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> against <a href="10245a.htm">Metternich</a>; on 14 January, 1848 in a speech on the Sonderbund, the finest, perhaps, he ever uttered, he impeached <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> radicalism, and proclaimed that <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, in the face of Radicalism, was "destined to uphold the flag and safeguard the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of liberty". Never did a speech so carry men away, wrote Sainte-Beuve.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But it was especially to secure liberty of teaching (see <a href="06166a.htm">FRANCE</a> and <a href="05772b.htm">FALLOUX DU COUDRAY</a>) that Montalembert devoted his efforts. In 1839 he addressed an eloquent letter to Villemain, minister of public instruction, demanding that liberty; in 1841 under pressure from the episcopate, he compelled Villemain to withdraw a bill on <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> because it was not sufficiently liberal; in his pamphlet "Du Devoir des Catholiques dans la question de la libert&eacute; d'enseignement", published in 1843, he summoned the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to take part in the struggle. On 16 April, 1844, in the House of Peers, he undertook the defence of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had attacked a second bill brought in by Villemain, and he replied to Dupin, who demanded the punishment of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>: "We are the sons of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a>; and we shall never yield to the sons of Voltaire"; then again he took an active part in the discussion of the bill, which owing to Villemain's <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> infirmity was abandoned. Between 1845 and 1846 he solicited petitions among the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> in support of liberty of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and he succeeded in having 140 supporters of <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> liberty elected as deputies in 1846. In 1847 he renewed the attack on the bill introduced by Salvandy and declared it unacceptable. The July monarchy fell before the question was settled. The Revolution of 1848 respected the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 26 March, 1848, wrote to Montalembert: "We gladly believe that it is in part owing to your eloquence, which has endeared your name to your generous countrymen, that no harm has been done to religion or its <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>".</p>

<p>Under the Second Republic Montalembert, in reply to Victor Hugo, who criticized the sending of a French expedition to aid <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, declared amid the applause of two-thirds of the Constituent Assembly that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is "a mother, the mother of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the mother of modern <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>". Once more he took up the struggle for liberty of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>; in 1849, together with <a href="05202a.htm">Dupanloup</a> he was the chief instigator of the negotiations between the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and a number of liberals such as <a href="14635b.htm">Thiers</a>, which resulted in spite of the sharp attacks of <a href="15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a> in the definitive grant of liberty of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> by the Falloux Law. When in October, 1850, Montalembert went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> congratulated him, and <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be named Civis Romanis by the municipality of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After the Coup d'Etat, 2 Dec., 1851 in an open letter to the "Univers", he invited the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to rally to <a href="10699a.htm">Louis Napoleon</a>; this manifesto, which he afterwards regretted, was the result of an <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> he had that it was unwholesome for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to abstain from taking part in the life of the State. But when in 1852 he had appealed in vain to <a href="10699a.htm">Louis Napoleon</a> to abrogate the <a href="01756a.htm">organic articles</a>, to grant liberty of higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and freedom of association, he refused to enter the Senate. He was deputy for <a href="02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> to the legislature of 1852-1857, but failed to be re-elected in 1857 owing to the defection of many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> voters. He cut himself off entirely from <a href="15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a> and the "Univers", which he thought accepted with too great complacency all the acts of the new government curtailing certain political liberties.</p>

<p>The break began in 1852 when Montalembert's pamphlet "Les Int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts Catholiques au XIXeme Si&agrave;cle" was attacked by <a href="07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> and <a href="15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a>; it became more marked in 1855 when Montalembert, taking from Lenormant's hands the management of the "Correspondant", which had at the time only 672 subscribers, made that review an organ of the political opposition, and took up the side known as "liberal" in contradistinction to the views supported by the "Univers". As an organ of the opposition "Le Correspondant" was often at odds with the imperial government: in 1858 an article Montalembert wrote entitled "Un d&eacute;bat sur l'Inde au Parlement anglais" led to his prosecution, and in spite of the defence set up by Benyer and Dufaure he was sentenced to three months' <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, which the emperor remitted. In 1859 his article on "Pie IX et la France en 1849 et 1859", in which he attacked the partiality of the empire towards <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and all the opponents of the temporal power, caused some disquiet in court circles, and won for him the congratulations of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. His two letters to Cavour, Oct., 1860, and April 1861, in which he attacked the centralizing spirit of those who were bringing about Italian unity, and took up the defence of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, drew from <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> the enthusiastic exclamation of "Vivat, vivat! our dear Montalembert has surpassed himself". But the hostility between the "Correspondant" and the "Univers" was growing, and in the heat of the struggle Montalembert wished to profit by the Congress of <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> (August, 1863) to pour out his whole <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> concerning the future of modern <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>His first speech aimed to show the necessity of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianizing</a> the democracy by accepting modern liberties. His second speech dealt with liberty of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and the conclusion he drew was that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> could be in perfect harmony with religious liberty and with the modern state which is founded on that liberty, and that everyone is free to hold that the modern state is to be preferred to the one which preceded it. The future Cardinal Pie, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, the future <a href="09111b.htm">Cardinal Ledochowski</a>, Nuncio at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, Mr. Talbot, Chamberlain to <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, <a href="15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a>, and the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who edited the "Civilt&agrave; Cattolica" were alarmed at these declarations. On the other hand Cardinal Sterckx, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, the future Cardinals Guibert and <a href="09050d.htm">Lavigerie</a>, many well-known <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, such as P&agrave;res de Ponlevoy, <a href="11243b.htm">Olivaint</a>, Matignon, and especially <a href="05202a.htm">Bishop Dupanloup</a> of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, supported him and took up his defence. At the end of March, 1864, he received a letter from <a href="01583d.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a> finding fault with the <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> speeches. When, on 8 Dec., 1864, the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Quanta Cura" and the Syllabus were issued, Montalembert resisted the advice given him by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> L&eacute;on de Malleville to protest publicly against these pontifical documents as a political measure; and the commentary on the Syllabus which <a href="05202a.htm">Dupanloup</a> published, and <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> approved of, 4 Dec., 1865, met with his <a href="07131b.htm">joyous</a> adhesion.</p>

<p>When the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> drew near he feared that the council would infer from the Syllabus and define as <a href="01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> certain affirmative propositions concerning liberty and touching on the State. He encouraged the authors of the Coblenz manifesto who raised <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to the opportuneness of the <a href="07790a.htm">infallibility</a> question, and he drew up under the heading "Questions au futur concile" a great number of disquieting grievances which he circulated among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The three hundred pages he wished to insert in the "Correspondant" on the causes of Spanish decadence, and in which he made a lively attack on the "Civilt&agrave; Cattolica", were refused by the "Correspondant", and so Montalembert broke off his connexion with that review.</p>

<p>His letter to the lawyer Lallemand, published in the "Gazette do France", 7 March, 1870, was intended to reconcile his former "ultramontanism" with his present state of feeling, which had been styled Gallicanism. In that letter he spoke of "The idol which the lay <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of absolutism had set up in the Vatican". The impression left by this letter, which Abb&eacute; Combalot in the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of San Andrea della Valle styled a "satanic work, was still fresh in the mind of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, when Montalembert died, 13 March, 1870. <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> refused to allow a solemn service to be held for him in the Ara Coeli; but a few days later he gave orders that an office should be sung in Santa Maria Transpontina, and he attended there himself in one of the barred galleries.</p>

<p>The letter (published very much later) which on 28 September, 1869, he wrote to M. Hyacinthe Loyson to dissuade him from leaving the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, is in the opinion of M. Emile Ollivier "one of the most pathetic appeals that ever came from the human heart"; and the future Cardinal Perraud, when pronouncing the panegyric of Montalembert in the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, could say that even his latest writings, however daring they might be, were filled with "a noble passion of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>".</p>

<p>A member of the <a href="01089a.htm">French Academy</a> from 9 January, 1851 Montalembert was both an orator and a historian. As early as 1835 he had planned to write a life of <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>. He was led to publish in 1860, under the title "Les Moines d'Occident", two volumes on the origin of monasticism; then followed three volumes on the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; he died before he reached the period of St. Bernard. But he left among his papers, on the one hand, a <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> entitled "Influence de l'ordre monastique sur la noblesse f&eacute;odale et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; la&iuml;que jusqu'&agrave; la fin du XIe si&agrave;cle", and on the other hand a work on <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and the <a href="08084c.htm">conflict of investitures</a>; and these two <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, published in 1877 by his friend Foisset and his son-in-law the Vicomte de Meaux, made up the sixth and seventh volume of the "Moines d'Occident". His work on "L'Avenir politique de l'Angleterre", published in 1856, drew a brilliant picture of the parliamentary institutions of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and rejoiced in the ascendant march of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in the British Empire.</p>

<p>Finally, Montalembert was one of the writers who did most to foster in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> regard and taste for Gothic Art. His letter to Victor Hugo on "Vandalisme en France", published 1 March, 1833, made a strong impression everywhere, and helped to save many Gothic monuments from impending ruin. <a href="12723b.htm">Auguste Reichensperger</a> and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a> profited by the artistic lessons of Montalembert. In 1838 he addressed to the French <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> an eloquent appeal, in which he praised the German <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="11362a.htm">Overbeck</a>, and lamented that <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03710a.htm">Christian art</a> was debased by <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> infiltrations. He interested himself in the dilapidated condition of the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Notre Dame, and caused the House of Peers in 1845 to vote a sum of money to repair it. His speech on vandalism in works of art, before the same assembly, 27 June, 1847, denounced the demolitions and <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> restorations carried on by government architects, and brought about a change for the better. It was partly due to him that in 1837 the Historical Committee of Arts and Monuments, for the preserving of works of art, was established; and on the other hand, <a href="04049b.htm">churchmen</a> laid such weight on his artistic opinions, that even from far-off Kentucky Mgr Flaget, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bardstown, wrote to him asking him to draw up a plan for the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> he was about to build at <a href="09386a.htm">Louisville</a>.</p>

<p>Montalembert's "Speeches" have been published in three volumes; his "Polemics" in three volumes also.</p>
