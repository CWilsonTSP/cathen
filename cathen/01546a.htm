<p><a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>; born at <a href="01591c.htm">Aosta</a> a <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> town on the confines of <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, died 21 April, 1109.</p>

<p>His father, Gundulf, was a Lombard who had become a citizen of <a href="01591c.htm">Aosta</a>, and his mother, Ermenberga, came of an old <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. Like many other <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, Anselm learnt the first lessons of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> from his mother, and at a very early age he was fired with the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of learning. In after life he still cherished the memories of childhood, and his biographer, Eadmer, has preserved some incidents which he had learnt from the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> own lips. The child had heard his mother speak of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, Who dwelt on high ruling all things. Living in the mountains, he thought that <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a> must be on their lofty summits. "And while he often revolved these matters in his mind, it chanced that one night he saw in a vision that he must go up to the summit of the mountain and hasten to the court of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the great King. But before he began to ascend the mountain, he saw in the plain through which he had passed to its foot, <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, who were the King's handmaidens, reaping the corn; but they were doing this very negligently and <a href="14057c.htm">slothfully</a>. Then, grieving for their <a href="14057c.htm">sloth</a>, and rebuking them, he bethought him that he would accuse them before their Lord and King. Thereafter, having climbed the mountain he entered the royal court. There he found the King with only his cupbearer. For it seemed that, as it was now Autumn, the King had sent his household to gather the harvest. As the boy entered he was called by the Master, and drawing nigh he sat at his feet. Then with cheery kindliness he was asked who and whence he was and what he was seeking. To these questions he made answer as well as he <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a>. Then at the Master's command some moist white bread was brought him by the cupbearer and he feasted thereon in his presence, wherefore when morning came and he brought to mind the things he had seen, as a simpler and innocent child he believed that he had truly been fed in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> with the bread of the Lord, and this he publicly affirmed in the presence of others". (Eadmer, Life of St. Anselm, I, i.) Eadmer adds that the boy was beloved by all and made rapid progress in learning. Before he was fifteen he sought admission to a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. But the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, fearing the father's displeasure, refused him. The boy then made a strange <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. He asked for an illness, thinking this would move the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> to yield to his wishes. The illness came but his admission to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was still denied him. None the less he determined to gain his end at some future date. But ere long he was drawn away by the pleasures of youth and lost his first ardour and his <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of learning. His <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for his mother in some measure restrained him. But on her death it seemed that his anchor was lost, and he was at the mercy of the waves.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>At this time his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> treated him with great harshness; so much so that he resolved to leave his home. Taking a single companion, he set out on foot to cross Mont Cenis. At one time he was fainting with hunger and was fain to refresh his strength with snow, when the servant found that some bread was still left in the baggage, and Anselm regained strength and continued the journey. After passing nearly three years in <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, he came into <a href="11104a.htm">Normandy</a> and tarried for a while at Avranches before finding his home at the Abbey of Bec, then made illustrious by <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc's</a> learning. Anselm profited so well by the lessons of this master that he became his most familiar disciple and shared in the work of teaching. After spending some time in this labour, he began to think that his toil would have more merit if he took the monastic habit. But at first he felt some reluctance to enter the Abbey of Bec, where he would be overshadowed by <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>. After a time, however, he saw that it would profit him to remain where he would be surpassed by others. His father was now dead, having ended his days in the monastic habit, and Anselm had some thought of living on his patrimony and relieving the needy. The life of a <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> also presented itself to him as a third alternative. Anxious to act with <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> he first asked the advice of <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, who referred the matter to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. This <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> decided in favour of the monastic life, and Anselm became a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> in the Abbey of Bec. This was in 1060. His life as a simple <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> lasted for three years, for in 1063 <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> was appointed <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Caen, and Anselm was elected to succeed him as Prior. There is some <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of this appointment. But Canon Poree points out that Anselm, writing at the time of his election as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> (1093), says that he had then lived thirty three years in the monastic habit, three years as a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> without preferment, fifteen as prior, and fifteen as <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> (Letters of Anselm, III, vii). This is confirmed by an entry in the chronicle of the Abbey of Bec, which was compiled not later than 1136. Here it is recorded that Anselm died in 1109, in the forty-ninth year of his monastic life and the seventy-sixth of his age, having been three years a simple <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>; fifteen, prior; fifteen, <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>; and sixteen <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (Poree, Histoire de l'abbaye de Bec, III, 173). At first his promotion to the office vacated by <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> gave offence to some of the other <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who considered they had a better claim than the young stranger. But Anselm overcame their opposition by gentleness, and ere long had won their affection and obedience. To the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of prior he added those of teacher. It was likewise during this period that he composed some of his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works, notably, the "Monologium" and the "Proslogium". Besides giving good counsel to the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> under his care, he found time to comfort others by his letters. Remembering his attraction for the solitude of a hermitage we can hardly wonder that he felt oppressed by this busy life and longed to lay aside his office and give himself up to the delights of contemplation. But the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> bade him retain his office and prepare for yet greater burdens.</p>

<p>This advice was prophetic, for in 1078, on the death of Herluin, founder and first <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bec Anselm was elected to succeed him. It was with difficulty that the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> overcame his reluctance to accept the office. His biographer, Eadmer, gives us a picture of a strange scene. The Abbot-elect fell prostrate before the brethren and with tears besought them not to lay this burden on him, while they prostrated themselves and earnestly begged him to accept the office. His election at once brought Anselm into relations with <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, where the Norman <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> had several possessions. In the first year of his office, he visited Canterbury where he was welcomed by <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>. "The converse of Lanfranc and Anselm", says Professor Freeman, "sets before us a remarkable and memorable pair. The lawyer, the secular scholar, met the divine and the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> statesman stood face to face with the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>. The wisdom, conscientious no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> but still hard and worldly, which could guide churches and kingdoms in troublous times was met by the boundless <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> which took in all <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures of whatever race or species" (History of the Norman Conquest, IV, 442). It is interesting to note that one of the matters discussed on this occasion related to a Saxon <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="05394a.htm">Elphage</a> (&AElig;lfheah), who had been <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the Danes for refusing to pay a ransom which would impoverish his people. <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> his claim to the honours of a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> since he did not die for the Faith. But Anselm solved the difficulty by saying that he who died for this lesser reason would much more be ready to die for the Faith. Moreover, Christ is <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and he who dies for <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> dies for Christ. It was on this occasion that Anselm first met Eadmer, then a young <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. At the same time the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, who in his childhood was <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> by all who <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> him, and who, as Prior of Bec, had won the affection of those who resisted his authority, was already gaining the hearts of <a href="05431b.htm">Englishmen</a>. His fame had spread far and wide, and many of the great men of the age prized his friendship and sought his counsel. Among these was William the Conqueror, who desired that Anselm might come to give him consolation on his death-bed.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>When <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> died, William Rufus kept the <a href="03299b.htm">See of Canterbury</a> vacant for four years, seized its revenues, and kept the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in a state of <a href="01452a.htm">anarchy</a>. To many the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bec seemed to be the man best fitted for the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishopric</a>. The general desire was so evident that Anselm felt a reluctance to visit <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> lest it should appear that he was seeking the office. At length, however, he yielded to the entreaty of Hugh, Earl of <a href="03649a.htm">Chester</a> and came to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1092. Arriving in Canterbury on the eve of the <a href="10712b.htm">Nativity of the Blessed Virgin</a>, he was hailed by the people as their future <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; but he hastened away and would in no wise consent to remain for the festival. At a private interview with the King, who received him kindly, he spoke freely on the evils by which the land was made desolate. Anselm's own affairs kept him in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> for some months, but when he wished to return to Bec the King objected. Meanwhile the people made no secret of their desires. With the King's permission <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> were offered in all the churches that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> would move the King to deliver the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> by the appointment of a <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>, and at the request of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> Anselm drew up the form of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The King fell ill early in the new year (1093), and on his sick-bed he was moved to repentance. The <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> and barons urged on him the necessity of electing an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Yielding to the manifest desire of all he named Anselm, and all joyfully concurred in the election. Anselm, however, firmly refused the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, whereupon another scene took place still more strange than that which occurred when he was elected <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>. He was dragged by force to the King's bedside, and a <a href="04515c.htm">pastoral staff</a> was thrust into his closed hand; he was borne thence to the altar where the "Te Deum" was sung. There is no reason to suspect the sincerity of this resistance. Naturally drawn to contemplation, Anselm could have little liking for such an office even in a period of peace; still less could he desire it in those stormy days. He <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> full well what awaited him. The King's repentance passed away with his sickness and Anselm soon saw signs of trouble. His first offence was his refusal to consent to the alienation of Church lands which the King had granted to his followers. Another difficulty arose from the King's need of money. Although his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was impoverished by the royal rapacity, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> was expected to make his majesty a free gift; and when he offered five hundred marks they were scornfully refused as insufficient. As if these trials were not enough Anselm had to bear the reproaches of some of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Bec who were loath to lose him; in his letters he is at pains to show that he did not desire the office. He finally was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> 4 December, 1093. It now remained for him to go to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a>. But here was a fresh occasion of trouble. The <a href="07063a.htm">Antipope Clement</a> was disputing the authority of <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, who had been recognized by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and Normandy. It does not appear that the English King was a partisan of the <a href="07063a.htm">Antipope</a>, but he wished to strengthen his own position by asserting his right to decide between the rival claimants. Hence, when Anselm asked leave to go to the <a href="12260a.htm">Pope</a>, the King said that no one in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> should acknowledge either Pope till he, the King, had decided the matter. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> insisted on going to <a href="15210a.htm">Pope Urban</a>, whose authority he had already acknowledged, and, as he had told the King, this was one of the conditions on which alone he would accept the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishopric</a>. This grave question was referred to a council of the realm held at Rockingham in March, 1095. Here Anselm boldly asserted the authority of <a href="15210a.htm">Urban</a>. His speech is a memorable testimony to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy. It is significant that not one of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> could call it in question (Eadmer, Historia Novorum, lib. I). Regarding Anselm's <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> on this point we may cite the frank words of Dean Hook: "Anselm was simply a papist &#151; He believed that St. Peter was the Prince of the Apostles &#151; that as such he was the source of all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority and power; that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was his successor; and that consequently, to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was due, from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> as well as from the rest of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a>, the obedience which a spiritual suzerain has the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to expect from his vassals" [Lives of the Archbishops of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (London, 18(i0-75), II, 183].</p>

<p>William now sent envoys to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to get the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a>. They found <a href="15210a.htm">Urban</a> in possession and recognized him. Walter, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01255b.htm">Albano</a>, came back with them as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> bearing the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a>. The King publicly acknowledged the authority of <a href="15210a.htm">Urban</a>, and at first endeavoured to get Anselm deposed by the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>. Eventually a reconciliation was occasioned by the royal difficulties in <a href="15532a.htm">Wales</a> and in the north. The King and the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> met in peace. Anselm would not take the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the King's hand; but in a solemn service at <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> on 10 June, 1095 it was laid on the altar by the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>, whence Anselm took it. Fresh trouble arose in 1097. On returning from his ineffectual <a href="15532a.htm">Welsh</a> campaign William brought a charge against the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> in regard to the contingent he had furnished and required him to meet this charge in the King's court. Anselm declined and asked leave to go to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This was refused, but after a meeting at <a href="15649c.htm">Winchester</a> Anselm was told to be ready to sail in ten days. On parting with the King, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> gave him his blessing, which William received with bowed head. At <a href="13365c.htm">St. Omer's</a> Anselm confirmed a multitude of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a> was spent at Cluny, and the rest of the winter at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. In the spring he resumed his journey and crossed Mont Cenis with two companions all travelling as simple <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. At the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> on their way they were frequently asked for news of Anselm. On his arrival in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was treated with great <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> by the <a href="12260a.htm">Pope</a>. His case was considered and laid before the council, but nothing could be done beyond sending a letter of remonstrance to William. During his stay in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> Anselm enjoyed the hospitality of the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="14476a.htm">Telese</a>, and passed the summer in a mountain village belonging to this <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Here he finished his work, "Cur Deus Homo", which he had begun in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. In October, 1098, <a href="15210a.htm">Urban</a> held a council at <a href="02295a.htm">Bari</a> to deal with the difficulties raised by the Greeks in regard to the procession of the Holy Ghost. Here Anselm was called by the Pope to a place of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> and bidden to take the chief part in the discussion. His arguments were afterwards committed to writing in his treatise on this subject. His own case was also brought before this council, which would have <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> William but for Anselm's intercession. Both he and his companions now desired to return to <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, but were bidden to await the action of another council to be held in the Lateran at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>. Here Anselm heard the canons passed against Investitures, and the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the offenders. This incident had a deep influence on his career in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>.</p>

<p>While still staying in the neighbourhood of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Anselm heard of the tragic death of William. Soon messages from the new king and chief men of the land summoned him to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Landing at Dover, he hastened to King Henry at <a href="13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>. He was kindly received, but the question of Investitures was at once raised in an acute form. Henry required the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> himself to receive a fresh investiture. Anselm alleged the decrees of the recent Roman council and declared that he had no choice in the matter. The difficulty was postponed, as the King decided to send to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to ask for a special exemption. Meanwhile, Anselm was able to render the King two signal services. He helped to remove the obstacle in the way of his marriage with Edith, the heiress of the Saxon kings. The daughter of <a href="09652b.htm">St. Margaret</a> had sought shelter in a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, where she had worn the veil, but had taken no <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>. It was thought by some that this was a bar to marriage, but Anselm had the case considered in a council at Lambeth where the royal maiden's liberty was fully established, and the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> himself gave his blessing to the marriage. Moreover, when Robert landed at <a href="12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a> and many of the Norman nobles were wavering in their allegiance, it was Anselm who turned the tide in favour of Henry. In the meantime <a href="11514a.htm">Pope Paschal</a> had refused the King's request for an exemption from the Lateran decrees, yet Henry persisted in his resolution to compel Anselm to accept investiture at his hands. The revolt of Robert de Bellesme put off the threatened rupture. To gain time the King sent another embassy to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On its return, Anselm was once more required to receive investiture. The Pope's letter was not made public, but it was reported to be of the same tenor as his previous reply. The envoys now gave out that the Pope had orally consented to the King's request, but could not say so in writing for fear of offending other sovereigns. Friends of Anselm who had been at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, disputed this assertion. In this crisis it was agreed to send to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> again; meanwhile the King would continue to invest <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, but Anselm should not be required to <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> them.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>During this interval Anselm held a council at <a href="15598a.htm">Westminster</a>. Here stringent canons were passed against the evils of the age. In spite of the compromise about investiture, Anselm was required to <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> invested by the King, but he firmly refused, and it soon became evident that his firmness was taking effect. Bishops gave back the staff they had received at the royal hands, or refused to be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by another in defiance of Anselm. When the Pope's answer arrived, repudiating the story of the envoys, the King asked Anselm to go to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> himself. Though he could not support the royal request he was willing to lay the facts before the <a href="12260a.htm">Pope</a>. With this understanding he once more betook himself to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The request was again refused, but Henry was not <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Understanding that Henry did not wish to receive him in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, Anselm interrupted his homeward journey at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. In this city he received a letter from the Pope informing him of the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the counsellors who had advised the King to insist on investitures, but not decreeing anything about the King. Anselm resumed his journey, and on the way he heard of the illness of Henry's sister, Adela of <a href="02602b.htm">Blois</a>. He turned aside to visit her and on her recovery informed her that he was returning to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> her brother. She at once exerted herself to bring about a meeting between Anselm and Henry, in July, 1105. But though a reconciliation was effected, and Anselm was urged to return to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, the claim to invest was not relinquished, and recourse had again to be made to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. A <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> letter authorizing Anselm to absolve from censures incurred by breaking the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> against investitures healed past offences but made no provision for the future. At length, in a council held in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> in 1107, the question found a solution. The King relinquished the claim to invest <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, while the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> allowed the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> to do homage for their temporal possessions. <a href="09270c.htm">Lingard</a> and other writers consider this a triumph for the King, saying that he had the substance and abandoned a mere form. But it was for no mere form that this long <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> had been waged. The rite used in the investiture was the symbol of a real power claimed by the English kings, and now at last abandoned. The victory rested with the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, and as <a href="13592a.htm">Schwane</a> says (Kirchenlexicon, s.v.) it prepared the way for the later solution of the same controversy in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Anselm was allowed to end his days in peace. In the two years that remained he continued his pastoral labours and composed the last of his writings. Eadmer, the faithful chronicler of these contentions, gives a pleasing picture of his peaceful death. The dream of his childhood was come <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>; he was to climb the mountain and taste the bread of <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</p>

<p>His active work as a <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and stalwart champion of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> makes Anselm one of the chief figures in <a href="07365a.htm">religious history</a>. The sweet influence of his spiritual teaching was felt far and wide, and its fruits were seen in many lands. His stand for the freedom of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in a crisis of <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> history had far-reaching effects long after his own time. As a writer and a thinker he may claim yet higher rank, and his influence on the course of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> was even deeper and more enduring if he stands on the one hand with <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, and Thomas Becket; on the other he may claim a place beside <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, and <a href="14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>. His merits in the field of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> have received official recognition; he has been declared a <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a> by <a href="04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, 1720, and in the office read on his <a href="06021b.htm">feast day</a> (21 April) it is said that his works are a pattern for all <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Yet it may be <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether his position is generally appreciated by students of divinity. In some degree his work has been hidden by the fabric reared on his foundations. His books were not adopted, like those of <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> and <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, as the usual text of commentators and lecturers in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, nor was he constantly cited as an authority, like <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. This was natural enough, since in the next century new methods came in with the rise of the Arabic and <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> philosophy; the "Books of Sentences" were in some ways more fit for regular <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> reading; Anselm was yet too near to have the venerable authority of the early Fathers. For these reasons it may be said that his writings were not properly appreciated till time had brought in other changes in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and men were led to study the history of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. But though his works are not cast in the systematic form of the "Summa" of St. Thomas, they cover the whole field of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. There are few pages of our <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> that have not been illustrated by the labours of Anselm. His treatise on the procession of the Holy Spirit has helped to guide scholastic speculations on the Trinity, his "Cur Deus Homo" throws a flood of light on the <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of the Atonement, and one of his works anticipates much of the later controversies on Free Will and <a href="12378a.htm">Predestination</a>. In the seventeenth century, a <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, Cardinal d'Aguirre made the writings of Anselm the groundwork of a course of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, "S. Anselmi Theologia" (Salamanca, 1678-81). Unfortunately the work never got beyond the first three folio volumes, containing the commentaries on the "Monologium". In recent years Dom Anselm &Ouml;cs&eacute;nyi, O.S.B. has accomplished the task on a more modest scale in a little Latin volume on the <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of St. Anselm, "De Theologia S. Anselmi" (Br&uuml;nn, 1884).</p>

<p>Besides being one of the fathers of <a href="13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>, Anselm fills an important place in the history of philosophic speculation. Coming in the first phase of the controversy on <a href="15182a.htm">Universals</a>, he had to meet the extreme <a href="11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> of <a href="13189c.htm">Roscelin</a>; partly from this fact, partly from his native <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a> his Realism took what may be considered a somewhat extreme form. It was too soon to find the golden mean of moderate Realism, accepted by later <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. His position was a stage in the process and it is significant that one of his biographers, <a href="08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, was among the first to find the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> solution.</p>

<p>Anselm's chief achievement in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was the ontological argument for the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a> put forth in his "Proslogium". Starting from the notion that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is "that than which nothing greater can be thought", he argues that what exists in reality is greater than that which is only in the mind; wherefore, since "<a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is that than which nothing greater can be thought", He exists in reality. The validity of the argument was disputed at the outset by a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> named Gaunilo, who wrote a criticism on it to which Anselm replied. Eadmer tells a curious story about St. Anselm's anxiety while he was trying to work out this argument. He could think of nothing else for days together. And when at last he saw it clearly, he was filled with <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a>, and made haste to commit it to writing. The waxen tablets were given in charge to one of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> but when they were wanted they were missing. Anselm managed to recall the argument, it was written on fresh tablets and given into safer keeping. But when it was wanted it was found that the wax was broken to Pieces. Anselm with some difficulty put the fragments together and had the whole copied on parchment for greater security. The story sounds like an allegory of the fate which awaited this famous argument, which was lost and found again, pulled to pieces and restored in the course of controversy. Rejected by <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and his followers, it was revived in another form by <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a>. After being assailed by <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a>, it was defended by <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, for whom it had a peculiar fascination &#151; he recurs to it in many parts of his writings. In one place he says that it is generally used by later <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, "yet always along with the other <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a>, although it alone is the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> one" (German Works, XII, 547). Assailants of this argument should remember that all minds are not cast in one mould, and it is easy to understand how some can feel the force of arguments that are not felt by others. But if this <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> were indeed, as some consider it, an absurd fallacy, how could it appeal to such minds as those of Anselm, <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, and <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel</a>? It may be well to add that the argument was not rejected by all the great <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>. It was accepted by <a href="01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> (Summa, Pt. I, Q. iii, memb. 1, 2), and supported by <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a>. (In I, Dist. ii, Q. ii.) In modern times it is accepted by M&ouml;hler, who quotes <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel's</a> defence with approval.</p>

<p>It is not often that a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> saint wins the admiration of German <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and English historians. But Anselm has this singular distinction <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel's</a> appreciation of his <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> powers may be matched by Freeman's warm words of praise for the great <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. "Stranger as he was, he has won his place among the noblest worthies of our island. It was something to be the model of all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> perfection; it was something to be the creator of the <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> &#151; but it was something higher still to be the very embodiment of righteousness and mercy, to be handed down in the annals of humanity as the man who saved the hunted hare and stood up for the <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of &AElig;lfheah" (History of the Norman Conquest, IV, 444).</p>

<p>Collections of the works of St. Anselm were issued soon after the invention of printing. Ocsenyi mentions nine earlier than the sixteenth century. The first attempt at a critical edition was that of <a href="12672c.htm">Th. Raynaud, S.J.</a>* (Lyons, 1630), which rejects many spurious works, e.g. the Commentaries on St. Paul. The best editions are those of Dom Gerberon, O.S.B. (Paris, 1675, 1721; <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> 1744, Migne, 1845). Most of the more important works have also been issued separately &#151; thus the "Monologium" is included in <a href="07583c.htm">Hurter's</a> "Opuscula SS. Patrum" and published with the "Proslogium" by Haas (T&uuml;bingen). There are numerous separate editions of the "Cur Deus Homo" and of Anselm's "Prayers and Meditations"; these last were done into English by Archbishop Laud (1638), and there are French and German versions of the "meditationes" and the "Monologium". "Cur Deus Homo" has also been translated into English and German &#151; see also the translations by Deane (Chicago, 1903). For Anselm's views on <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, see <a href="02379b.htm">ABBEY OF BEC</a>.</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The chief sources for Anselm's life are his own letters and the two biographical works of his friend, disciple, and secretary, Eadmer, monk of Canterbury, and Bishop-elect of St. Andrews. Eadmers's <em>Historia Nonorum</em> may be called the "Life and Times of St. Anselm"; his <em>Vita S. Anselmi</em> gives the inner life of the saint. Also, there is a brief account of the miracles of St. Anselm which is also ascribed to Eadmer, but its authorship is doubtful. Other early writers on Anselm, such as John of Salisbury, add some new details, but their account of the Saint is largely drawn from Eadmer.</p></div>
