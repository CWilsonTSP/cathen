<p>(<em>Stoa basilike</em>, or <em>basileios</em>).</p>

<p>The term <em>basilica</em> can indicate either the architectural style of a church, or its canonical status. Both senses will be treated in this article.</p>

<h2>"Basilica" in the architectural sense</h2>

<p>In architecture, the term <em>basilica</em> signifies a kingly, and secondarily a beautiful, hall. The name indicates the Eastern origin of the building, but it is in the West, above all in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that the finest examples of the basilica are found. Between 184 and 121 B.C. there were built in the Forum at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the basilicas of Porcia, Fulvia, Sempronia, and Opimia; after 46 B.C. the great Basilica Julia of Caesar and Augustus was erected. These buildings were designed to beautify the Forum and to be of use both for market purposes and for the administration of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. They were open to the public and were well lighted. According to Vitruvius, who in this certainly agrees with Greek authorities, the usual construction of a basilica was the following:</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The ground plan was a parallelogram in which the width was not greater than one-half of the length and not less than one-third of it. When there was more space in the length, porticoes were built on the short sides. The middle space was separated by columns from a lower <a href="01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> or portico; the width of the <a href="01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> equalled the height of the columns and measured one-third of the width of the central space. Above the columns just mentioned stood others, giving entrance to the light, which were shorter and slighter, in order that, as in organic structures, a tapering effect upwards should be given (De architectura, V, i, or ii). A basilica erected by Vitruvius himself showed a decided variation from this plan. It had two <a href="01406b.htm">ambulatories</a>, one above the other. Part of the columns of the middle space was left free so that light might enter. These columns rose up to the rafters. Pilasters leaning against the columns served to carry the flat roof of the <a href="01406b.htm">ambulatories</a>, the length of the middle <a href="10724b.htm">nave</a> was double its breadth and six times the breadth of the <a href="01406b.htm">ambulatory</a>. One of the long sides of the parallelogram spread out into an <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> where legal cases were tried, but it was separated by the width of the <a href="01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> from the space for merchants (the ancient exchange).</p>

<p>The same writer speaks (VI, viii or v) of half-public basilicas in the houses of distinguished statesmen which served as council-chambers and for the settlement of disputes by arbitration. Vitruvius compares these (VI, v or iii) with the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> halls because the latter had also covered <a href="01406b.htm">ambulatories</a> around a middle space supported by columns and openings for light between columns above. These are the distinctive features of a basilica which we may venture to define as an oblong structure with columns, having an <a href="01406b.htm">ambulatory</a> of lower height, receiving light from above, and possessing a projecting addition designed to serve a particular purpose.</p>

<p>The form of the basilica of the early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> church corresponds so exactly to the shape of the basilica of the Forum or of the house that it does not seem <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to seek another model, as for instance, the <em>atrium</em> or the cemetery cells. The dark, narrow temple was entirely unsuited for the holding of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> church services. These services, which began with the <a href="14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>, were often held in large rooms in the dwellings of prosperous <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. When these facts are considered it cannot be a matter of surprise that as early as the time of Constantine the style and name of the basilica seem to have been in common use for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> place of worship. Moreover, the chief deviations from the general type of the ancient basilica, such as five <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a>, pillars, angular form of the <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a>, omission of the portico, etc., have been used as well in the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> basilica to which the original meaning of the word <em>basilica</em>, "the hall of the king", could now again be applied.</p>

<p>As a rule, the building at this time was divided into three parts by columns, the well-lighted central part rose higher than the other divisions, and there was an <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a>. Only, in place of the former surrounding portico, or <a href="01406b.htm">ambulatory</a>, there was a side aisle to the right and left. There were also basilicas with five and seven <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a>. The old construction of the basilica with an <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> was well suited to the service of the altar. A <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a> extending more or less towards both sides was often placed between the <a href="10724b.htm">nave</a> and the <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> both to serve practical needs and on account of its symbolism. The roofing of the <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a> together with the <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> and portico produced variety in the exterior of the basilica. Vaulting, in the West, was used only at times in the side <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a>; nothing beyond a flat roof was ventured upon for the very broad middle <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a>, and often, at the beginning, the rafters of the roof were left uncovered.</p>

<p>It was only after the fifth century that round or square side-towers came into use. These towers were first incorporated in the main building in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>. The early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> basilica showed a high, yet light construction, and was roomy and well lighted. The arcades with slender columns which led up to the altar were a particularly beautiful feature. The round form of the arches, of the window-heads, and the ground plan of the basilica were the first indications of the Romanesque style. The <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a room in which the King of Kings gave audience naturally led to rich ornamentation. The back wall of the <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> and the "arch of triumph", which opened into the <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a>, were decorated with <a href="10584a.htm">mosaics</a>. The altar stood in, or before, the <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> under a decorated baldacchino (<em><a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a></em>). The walls were often adorned with pictures, and the floor was made of <a href="10584a.htm">mosaic</a>. Much use was made in the rich churches of beautiful woven stuffs and of fine goldsmith-work. If the employment of these symbols had a tendency to inspire <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a>, other observances produced <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> of mind, as, for example, the symbolic washing at the fountain.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>"Basilica" in the canonical sense</h2>

<p><em>Basilica</em>, as a term used by canon lawyers and <a href="09306a.htm">liturgists</a>, is a title assigned by formal concession or immemorial custom to certain more important churches, in virtue of which they enjoy privileges of an honorific character which are not always very clearly defined. Basilicas in this sense are divided into two classes, the greater or patriarchal, and the lesser, basilicas.</p>

<h3>Major basilicas</h3>

<p>To the former class belong primarily those four great churches of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (<a href="13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>, <a href="09014b.htm">St. John Lateran</a>, St. Mary Major, and <a href="13369a.htm">St. Paul-without-the-Walls</a>), which among other distinctions have a special "holy door" and to which a visit is always prescribed as one of the conditions for gaining the <a href="08531c.htm">Roman Jubilee</a>. They are also called patriarchal basilicas, seemingly as representative of the great ecclesiastical provinces of the world thus symbolically united in the heart of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>St. John Lateran is the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>.</li><li>St. Peter's is assigned to the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople,</li><li><a href="13369a.htm">St. Paul's</a> to the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>,</li><li>St. Mary Major to the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</li><li>St. Lawrence-outside-the-Walls is also reckoned as a greater basilica because it is specially attributed to the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. </li></ul></div>

<p>Moreover, a few other churches, notably that of St. Francis at <a href="01801a.htm">Assisi</a> and that of the <a href="12286a.htm">Portiuncula</a>, have also received the privilege of ranking as patriarchal basilicas. As such they possess a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne and an altar at which none may say <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> except by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> permission.</p>

<h3>Minor basilicas</h3>

<p>The lesser basilicas are much more numerous, including nine or ten different churches in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and a number of others, such as the Basilica of the Grotto at Lourdes, the votive Church of the Sacred Heart at Montmartre, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Marienthal in Alsace, etc. There has been a pronounced tendency of late years to add to their number. Thus the "Acta Apostolicae Sedis" for 1909 contain six, and the "Acta" for 1911 eight, such concessions.</p>

<p>In the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of erection the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> declares:</p>

<blockquote><p>We, by our apostolic authority . . . erect (such and such a church) to the dignity of a lesser basilica and bestow upon it all the privileges which belong to the lesser basilicas of this our own cherished city.</p></blockquote>

<p>These "privileges", besides conferring a certain precedence before other churches (not, however, before the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of any locality), include the right of the <em>conopaeum</em>, the bell, and the <em>cappa magna</em>. The <em>conopaeum</em> is a sort of umbrella (also called <em>papilio, sinicchio</em>, etc.), which together with the bell is carried processionally at the head of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> on state occasions. The <em>cappa magna</em> is worn by the canons or members of the collegiate chapter, if seculars, when assisting at Office. The form of the <em>conopaeum</em>, which is of red and yellow silk, is well shown in the arms of the <a href="03217a.htm#section2">cardinal camerlengo</a> (see vol. VII, p. 242, coloured plate) over the cross keys.</p>
