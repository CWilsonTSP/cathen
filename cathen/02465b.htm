<p>One of the most generally popular of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> services is Benediction of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, known in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> as <em>Salut</em> and in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> as <em>Segen</em>. It is ordinarily an afternoon or evening devotion and consists in the singing of certain <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, or <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a>, or canticles, before the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, which is exposed upon the altar in a <a href="11344a.htm">monstrance</a> and is surrounded with lights. At the end, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, his shoulders enveloped in a humeral veil, takes the <a href="11344a.htm">monstrance</a> into his hands and with it makes the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> (hence the name Benediction) in silence over the kneeling congregation. Benediction is often employed as a conclusion to other services, e.g. <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, <a href="04187a.htm">Compline</a>, the Stations of the Cross, etc., but it is also still more generally treated as a rite complete in itself. There is a good deal of diversity of usage in different countries with regard to details, but some of the elements are constant. The use of <a href="07716a.htm">incense</a> and wax candles, which even in the poorest churches must not be less than ten in number, the singing of the "Tantum ergo" with its versicle and <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the blessing given with the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> are <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> everywhere. In <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the principle obtains that the only portion of the service which is to be regarded as strictly <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> is the singing of the "Tantum ergo" and the giving of the Benediction which immediately follows. This <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is emphasized by the fact that in many Roman churches the celebrant, vested in cope and preceded by thurifier, <a href="01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, etc., only makes his entry into the sanctuary just before the "Tantum ergo" is begun. Previously to this the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed, informally so to speak, by a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in cotta and stole; and then choir and congregation are left to sing <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a> and canticles, or to say <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> and devotions as the occasion may demand, the whole service being of a very popular character.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In English-speaking countries the service generally begins with the entry of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and his assistants in procession and with the singing of the <a href="11334a.htm">"O Salutaris Hostia"</a> as soon as the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is taken out of the tabernacle. Indeed in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> the singing of the "O Salutaris" is enjoined in the "Ritus servandus", the code of procedure approved by a former synod of the Province of Westminster. On the other hand, the <a href="09287a.htm">Litany of Our Lady</a>, though usually printed after the "O Salutaris" and very generally sung at Benediction, is nowhere of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>. It may be added that further solemnity is often given to the service by the presence of <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> in <a href="04608a.htm">dalmatics</a>. When the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> officiates he uses <a href="10404a.htm">mitre</a> and <a href="04515c.htm">crosier</a> in the procession to the altar, and makes the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> over the people three times in giving the benediction. On the other hand, a very informal sort of service is permitted, where the means for carrying out a more elaborate rite are not available. The <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, wearing cotta and stole, simply opens the tabernacle door. <a href="12345b.htm">Prayers</a> and devotions are said or sung, and then the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="02599b.htm">blesses</a> those present with the veiled <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a> before the tabernacle door is again closed. The permission, general or special, of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for services where Benediction is given with the <a href="11344a.htm">monstrance</a>.</p>

<h2>History of the devotion</h2>

<p>It is easy to recognize in our ordinary Benediction service, the traces of two distinct elements. There is of course in the first place the direct veneration of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, which appears in the exposition, blessing, "Tantum ergo", etc. But besides this we note the almost invariable presence of what at first sight seems an incongruous element, that of the <a href="09287a.htm">litany of Loreto</a>, or of popular <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> in honor of <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. Tracing our present service back to its origin we find that these two features are derived from different sources. The <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of exposing the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> for veneration in a <a href="11344a.htm">monstrance</a> appears to have been first evolved at the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century. When the elevation of the Host at Mass was introduced in the early years of the thirteenth century, probably as a form of protest against the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> views of Peter the Chanter, the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> by degrees took firm hold of the popular mind that special virtue and merit were attached to the act of looking at the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. To such extremes did this prepossession go, that the seeing of the Host at the moment of the elevation was judged to be the most vital part of attendance at Mass. On certain churches in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> a screen of black velvet was held up behind the altar in order that the <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> hands and the Host might be more easily seen from afar; in others strict injunctions were given to the thurifer that he should on no account allow the smoke of the thurible to obstruct the view of the Host. Furthermore, we read that when men were dying and were unable on account of vomiting or any other cause to receive <a href="15397c.htm">Holy Viaticum</a>, the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was brought to them and held up before them to look at. Indeed, a virtual prohibition of this practice stands to this day amongst the <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the "Rituale Romanum."</p>

<p>Under the influence of this <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in the processions which became common after the institution of the feast of <a href="04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> in 1246, came by degrees to be carried in transparent vessels, resembling our present <a href="11344a.htm">monstrances</a>. Moreover, a custom grew up, especially in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, of keeping the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> continually exposed to view in churches. It was forbidden by many <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, but a sort of compromise was arrived at through the construction of the <em>Sakramentsh&auml;uschen</em> of which so many examples still exist in central <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. These tabernacles, of great height and imposing appearance, were erected in the most conspicuous part of the church, and there the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was reserved in a <a href="11344a.htm">monstrance</a> behind a metal door of lattice-work which allowed a more or less free view of the interior. It was thus that the practice developed, though partly kept in check by synodal decrees, of adding solemnity to any function, even the Mass itself, by exposing the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> during its continuance.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Turning now to our second element, we find that from the beginning of the thirteenth century, a custom prevailed among the confraternities and guilds which were established at that period in great numbers, of singing canticles in the evening of the day before a <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. These canticles were called <em>Laude</em> and were often composed in the vulgar tongue, becoming in the hands of such poets as the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Giacopone da Todi, one of the great popular influences which helped to develop a native Italian literature. Confraternities were formed for the express purpose of singing these canticles and their members were called <em>Laudesi.</em> It was such a company of <em>Laudesi</em> that brought together the seven holy founders who, in the first half of the thirteenth century, established the <a href="13736a.htm">Order of Servites</a>, or <a href="09750a.htm">Servants of Mary</a>. Although the <em>laude</em> hardly flourished outside <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where both the language and the character of the people lent themselves readily to the composition of innumerable canticles, the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of an evening service of a popular character sung before the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, spread throughout <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In particular, the "Salve Regina", a special devotion of the <a href="09750a.htm">Servites</a>, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and other orders, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by usage to this rite, and we find traces everywhere of its being sung, often by choirs of boys, for whom a special endowment was provided, as a separate evening service. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, this service was commonly known as a <em>Salut,</em> in the Low Countries as the <em>Lof,</em> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, simply as the <em>Salve.</em></p>

<p>Now it seems <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that our present Benediction service has resulted from the general adoption of this evening singing of canticles before the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, enhanced as it often came to be in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by the exposition of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, which as employed at first only as an adjunct to lend it additional solemnity. The blessing at the close seems to have been added simply because the custom gained ground of making the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> over the people whenever the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was replaced in the tabernacle after a procession or after being carried to the sick or any kind of an exposition. But in the course of the seventeenth century, we find numberless bequests for <em>Saluts</em> in French wills, the items to be sung, often of a most miscellaneous character, being minutely specified, and among these the condition is frequently appended that the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> should be exposed during the whole time of the <em>Salut</em>.</p>

<p>The development which is too intricate to be given here in further detail, may be investigated in the works mentioned below.</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">To the REV. V. DE BUCK, the Bollandist, belongs the merit of having first called attention to the true history of this devotion. See <em>Pr&eacute;cis Historiques</em> (Brussels, 1872), XXI, 59-70. His conclusions have been developed by the present writer in <em>The Month</em>, June to September, 1901, October, 1905, and in the book <em>Corpus Domini</em> (in preparation 1907). Useful material may be found in THIERS, <em>Trait&eacute; de l'Exposition du S. Sacrement,</em> written in 1673. The account of Benediction given by such authorities as CORBLET, <em>Histoire du Sacrement de l'Eucharistie</em> (Paris, 1885), II, 419-431, is not satisfactory. For the rubrical aspects of the service see DE MONTAULT, <em>(Euvres Compl&egrave;tes</em> (Paris, 1892), VI, 503-531; <em>Revue Th&eacute;ologique</em> (Paris, 1857), II, 305, 464, 693: WAPELEHORST, <em>Compendium Sacrae Liturgiae</em> (New York, 1904), 6th ed., 218f.; O'LOAN, <em>Ceremonies of some Ecclesiastical Functions</em> (3d ed., Dublin, 1901), 152-163.</p></div>
