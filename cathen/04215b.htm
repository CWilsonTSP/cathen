<p>A <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in which the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given to those already <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in order to make them strong and <a href="11665b.htm">perfect</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and soldiers of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>It has been variously designated: <em>bebaiosis</em> or <em>confirmatio</em>, a making fast or sure; <em>teleiosis</em> or <em>consummatio</em>, a perfecting or completing, as expressing its relation to <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. With reference to its effect it is the "Sacrament of the Holy Ghost", the "Sacrament of the Seal" (<em>signaculum, sigillum, sphragis</em>). From the external <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> it is known as the "imposition of hands" (<em>epithesis cheiron</em>), or as "anointing with chrism" (<em>unctio, chrismatio, chrisma, myron</em>). The names at present in use are, for the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, <em>confirmatio</em>, and for the Greek, <em>to myron</em>.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Present practice and doctrine</h2>

<h3>Rite</h3>

<p>In the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a> the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is usually administered by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. At the beginning of the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> there is a general <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> meantime <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> that the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> may come down upon those who have already been <a href="12714a.htm">regenerated</a>: "send forth upon them thy sevenfold <a href="07409a.htm">Spirit</a> the <a href="11469a.htm">Holy Paraclete</a>." He then anoints the forehead of each with <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> saying: "I sign thee with the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> and confirm thee with the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in the name of the Father and of the <a href="14142b.htm">Son</a> and of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." Finally, he gives each a slight blow on the cheek saying: "peace be with thee". A <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> is added that the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> may dwell in the hearts of those who have been confirmed, and the <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> closes with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="02599b.htm">blessing</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> omits the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> at the beginning, and accompanies the anointing with the words: "the sign [or <a href="13649a.htm">seal</a>] of the <a href="06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." These several actions symbolize the <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> and purpose of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: the anointing signifies the strength given for the spiritual conflict; the <a href="02226a.htm">balsam</a> contained in the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a>, the fragrance of <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the good odor of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>; the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> on the forehead, the <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> to confess <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, before all <a href="09580c.htm">men</a>; the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and the blow on the cheek, enrollment in the service of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> which brings <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> peace to the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. (Cf. <a href="../summa/4072.htm#article4"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.72.4</a>).</p>

<h3>Minister</h3>

<p>The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone is the <em>ordinary</em> <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> of confirmation. This is expressly declared by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VII, De Conf., C. iii). A <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> confirms validly even those who are not his own subjects; but to confirm licitly in another <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> he must secure the permission of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Simple <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> may be the <em>extraordinary</em> <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> under certain conditions. In such cases, however, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot wear <a href="12231b.htm">pontifical</a> <a href="15388a.htm">vestments</a>, and he is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to use <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a> by a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, confirmation is given by simple <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> without special <a href="04696b.htm">delegation</a>, and their ministration is accepted by the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a> as valid. They must, however, use <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a> by a patriarch.</p>

<h3>Matter and form</h3>

<p>There has been much discussion among <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a> as to what constitutes the essential <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Some, e.g. <a href="02111a.htm">Aureolus</a> and <a href="11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, held that it consists in the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. Others, with <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, and <a href="09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a>, maintain that it is the anointing with <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a>. According to a third opinion (<a href="10570b.htm">Morinus</a>, Tapper) either anointing or <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> suffices. Finally, the most generally accepted view is that the anointing and the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> conjointly are the <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a>. The "imposition", however, is not that with which the <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> begins but the <a href="07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> which takes place in the act of anointing. As <a href="11768d.htm">Peter the Lombard</a> declares: <em>Pontifex per impositionem manus confirmandos ungit in fronte</em> (IV Sent., dist. xxxiii, n. 1; cf. De Augustinis, "De re sacramentaria", 2d ed., Rome, 1889, I). The <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> employed must be a mixture of olive oil and <a href="02226a.htm">balsam</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. (For the manner of this <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> and for other details, historical and <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, see <a href="03696b.htm">CHRISM</a>.) The difference regarding the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, i.e. the words essential for confirmation, has been indicated above in the description of the <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a>. The validity of both the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> and the Greek <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> is unquestionable. Additional details are given below in the historical outline.</p>

<h3>Recipient</h3>

<p>Confirmation can be conferred only on those who have already been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> and have not yet been confirmed. As <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Confirmation is to <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> what growth is to generation. Now it is clear that a man cannot advance to a perfect age unless he has first been born; in like manner, unless he has first been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> he cannot receive the Sacrament of Confirmation (<a href="../summa/4072.htm#article6"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.72.6</a>).</p></blockquote>

<p>They should also be in the state of grace; for the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not given for the purpose of taking away <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> but of conferring additional grace. This <a href="04211a.htm">condition</a>, however, refers only to lawful reception; the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is validly received even by those in mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. In the early ages of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, confirmation was part of the <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> of initiation, and consequently was administered immediately after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. When, however, <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> came to be conferred by simple <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, the two <a href="03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> were separated in the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>. Further, when infant <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> became customary, confirmation was not administered until the child had attained the <a href="01209a.htm">use of reason</a>. This is the present practice, though there is considerable latitude as to the precise age. The <a href="13120c.htm">Catechism of the Council of Trent</a> says that the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> can be administered to all <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but that this is not expedient before the <a href="01209a.htm">use of reason</a>; and adds that it is most fitting that the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> be deferred until the child is seven years old, "for Confirmation has not been instituted as <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but that by virtue thereof we might be found well armed and prepared when called upon to fight for the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and for this kind of conflict no one will consider children, who are still without the use of <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a>, to be qualified." (Pt. II, ch. iii, 18.)</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Such, in fact, is the general usage in the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>. Under <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> circumstances, however, as, for instance, danger of death, or when the opportunity of receiving the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is but rarely offered, even younger children may be confirmed. In the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> and in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, infants are now, as in earlier times, confirmed immediately after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, writing 22 June, 1897, to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, commends most heartily the practice of confirming children before their first <a href="07402a.htm">communion</a> as being more in accord with the ancient usage of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h3>Effects</h3>

<p>Confirmation imparts</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>an increase of <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> which makes the recipient a <a href="11665b.htm">"perfect Christian"</a>;</li><li>a special <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> grace consisting in the seven <a href="06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and notably in the strength and <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> to confess boldly the name of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>;</li><li>an indelible <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> by reason of which the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be received again by the same <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>.</li></ul></div>

<p>A further consequence is the <a href="12731b.htm">spiritual relationship</a> which the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> confirming and the sponsor contract with the recipient and with the recipient's <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>. This <a href="12731b.htm">relationship</a> constitutes a diriment <a href="07695a.htm">impediment</a> to marriage. It does not arise between the <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and the sponsor nor between the sponsors themselves.</p>



<h3>Necessity</h3>

<p>Regarding the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of receiving the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, it is admitted that confirmation is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> as an indispensable means of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> (<em>necessitate medii</em>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, its reception is <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> (<em>necessitate pr&aelig;cepti</em>) "for all those who are able to understand and fulfill the <a href="04153a.htm">Commandments of God</a> and <a href="04154a.htm">of the Church</a>. This is especially <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of those who suffer <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> on account of their religion or are exposed to grievous <a href="14504a.htm">temptations</a> against <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> or are in danger of death. The more serious the danger so much greater is the need of protecting oneself". (Conc. Plen. Balt. II, n. 250.) As to the gravity of the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, opinions differ, some <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> holding that an unconfirmed <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> would commit mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> if he refused the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, others that the <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> would be at most venial unless the refusal implied contempt for the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. Apart, however, from such controversies the importance of confirmation as a means of grace is so obvious that no earnest <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> will neglect it, and in particular that <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> will not fail to see that their children are confirmed.</p>

<h3>Sponsors</h3>

<p>The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> prescribes under pain of grievous <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> that a sponsor, or godparent, shall stand for the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> confirmed. The sponsor should be at least fourteen years of age, of the same sex as the candidate, should have already received the Sacrament of Confirmation, and be well instructed in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. From this office are excluded the <a href="11478c.htm">father and mother</a> of the candidate, members of a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order (unless the candidate be a religious), <a href="11126b.htm">public sinners</a>, and those who are under public ban of <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> or <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Except in case of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> the baptismal godparent cannot serve as sponsor for the same <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> in confirmation. Where the opposite practice obtains, it should, according to a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of the Council, 16 Feb., 1884, be gradually done away with. The <a href="02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1866) declared that each candidate should have a sponsor, or that at least two godfathers should stand for the boys and two godmothers for the girls (n. 253). See also <a href="12395b.htm">prescriptions</a> of the First Council of Westminster. Formerly it was customary for the sponsor to place his or her right foot upon the foot of the candidate during the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>; the present usage is that the sponsor's right hand should be placed upon the right shoulder of the candidate. The Holy Office <a href="04670a.htm">decreed</a>, 16 June, 1884, that no sponsor could stand for more than two candidates except in case of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a>. The <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> of giving a new name to the candidate is not <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a>; but it has the <a href="13428a.htm">sanction</a> of several synodal <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The Fifth Council of Milan, under <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, insisted that a candidate whose name was "vile, ridiculous, or quite unbecoming for a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>" should receive another at Confirmation" (cf. <a href="09721a.htm">Mart&egrave;ne</a>).</p>

<p>It is clear from the diversity of practice at the present day, that there is much uncertainty as to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning confirmation. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is validly and lawfully administered in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; but this does not solve the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions regarding its institution, <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a>, <a href="06137b.htm">form</a>, and <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a>.</p>

<p>At the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> the difficulty was felt to be so great that the assembled Fathers contented themselves with only a few canons on the subject. They <a href="04675b.htm">defined</a> that confirmation was not "a vain <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> but a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> and proper <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>"; and that it was not "in olden days nothing but a sort of <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a> in which those who were entering upon youth gave an account of their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in the face of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>" (can. i). They did not define anything specific about the institution by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>; though in treating of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in general they had already <a href="04675b.htm">defined</a> that "all the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the New Law were instituted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ our Lord</a>" (Sess. VII, can. i). Nothing whatever was said about the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> of words to be used; and regarding the <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> they merely condemned any one who should maintain "that they who ascribe any virtue to the <a href="03696b.htm">sacred chrism</a> of confirmation offer an outrage to the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (can. ii). The third and last canon <a href="04675b.htm">defined</a> that the "ordinary" <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> only, and not any simple <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>.</p>

<p>This guarded language, so different from the definite canons on some of the other <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, shows that the council had no intention of deciding the questions at issue among <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a> regarding the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> and manner of the institution by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> (direct or indirect institution), the <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> (<a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> or anointing, or both), the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> ("I sign thee", etc., or "the seal", etc.), and the <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> (<a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>).</p>

<p>Elsewhere (Sess. VII, can. ix) the council <a href="04675b.htm">defined</a> that in confirmation a <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> is imprinted in the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is, a certain spiritual and indelible sign on account of which the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be repeated; and again (Sess. XXIII) the council declared that "<a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are superior to <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>; they administer the Sacrament of Confirmation; they <a href="11279a.htm">ordain</a> the <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; and they can perform many other things over which functions others of an inferior rank have no power".</p>

<p>Concerning the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> from the earliest times of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> (Lamentabili sane, 3 July, 1907) condemns the proposition (44): "There is no <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that the <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> of the Sacrament of Confirmation was employed by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>; the formal distinction, therefore, between the two <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and Confirmation, does not belong to the history of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>". The institution of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> has also been the subject of much discussion as will appear from the following account.</p>

<h2 id="section2">History</h2>

<p>The Sacrament of Confirmation is a striking instance of the development of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="09306a.htm">ritual</a> in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. We can, indeed, detect much more than the mere germs of it in <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>; but we must not expect to find there an exact description of the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> as at present performed, or a complete solution of the various <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions which have since arisen. It is only from the Fathers and the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> that we can gather information on these heads.</p>

<h3 id="A">Confirmation in the Bible</h3>

<p>We read in the <a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs14">Acts of the Apostles (8:14-17)</a> that after the <a href="13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="04347a.htm">converts</a> had been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Philip the deacon, the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> "sent unto them Peter and John, who, when they were come, <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them, that they might receive the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; for he was not yet come upon any of them, but they were only <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>; then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>".</p>

<p>Again (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs1">19:1-6</a>): <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> "came to Ephesus, and found certain <a href="05029a.htm">disciples</a>; and he said to them: Have you received the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> since ye <a href="02408b.htm">believed</a>? But they said to him: We have not so much as heard whether there be a <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And he said: In what then were you <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>? Who said: In John's <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Then Paul said: John <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> the people with the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of penance . . . Having heard these things, they were <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. And when Paul had <a href="07698a.htm">imposed his hands</a> on them, the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and <a href="12473a.htm">prophesied</a>".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From these two passages we learn that in the earliest ages of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> there was a <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a>, distinct from <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in which the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was conferred by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> (<em>dia tes epitheseos ton cheiron ton Apostolon</em>), and that the power to perform this <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was not implied in the power to <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a>.</p>

<p>No distinct mention is made as to the origin of this <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a>; but <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> promised the <a href="06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and conferred it. Again, no express mention is made of anointing with <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a>; but we note that the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of unction is commonly associated with the giving of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/luk004.htm#vrs18">Luke 4:18</a>) applies to Himself the words of <a href="08179b.htm">Isaias</a> (<a href="../bible/isa061.htm#vrs1">61:1</a>): "The <a href="07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon me, wherefore he hath anointed me to preach the <a href="06655b.htm">gospel</a>". St. Peter (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs38">Acts 10:38</a>) speaks of "<a href="08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>: how <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> anointed him with the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>". St. John tells the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>: "You have the unction (<em>chrisma</em>) from the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy One</a>, and <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> all things"; and again: "Let the unction [<em>chrisma</em>], which you have received from him, abide in you" (<a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#vrs20">1 John 2:20-27</a>).</p>

<p>A striking passage, which was made much use of by the Fathers and the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>, is that of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>: "He that confirmeth [<em>ho de bebaion</em>] us with you in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and hath anointed us, is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, who also hath sealed [<em>sphragisamenos</em>] us, and given us the pledge [<em>arrabona</em>] of the Spirit in our hearts" (<a href="../bible/2co001.htm#vrs20">2 Corinthians 1:20-21</a>). No mention is made of any particular words accompanying the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> on either of the occasions on which the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is described; but as the act of <a href="07698a.htm">imposing hands</a> was performed for various purposes, some <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> indicating the special purpose may have been used: "Peter and John . . . <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them, that they might receive the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>". Further, such expressions as "signing" and "sealing" may be taken as referring to the <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> impressed by the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>: "You were signed [<em>esphragisthete</em>] with the holy Spirit of promise"; "Grieve not the <a href="07409a.htm">holy Spirit of God</a>, whereby you are <a href="13649a.htm">sealed</a> [<em>esphragisthete</em>] unto the day of <a href="12677d.htm">redemption</a>" (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs13">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs30">4:30</a>). See also the <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#vrs20">passage from Second Corinthians</a> quoted above.</p>

<p>Again, in the <a href="07181a.htm">Epistle to the Hebrews</a> (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#vrs1">6:1-4</a>) the writer reproaches those whom he addresses for falling back into their primitive imperfect <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>; "whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God" (<a href="../bible/heb005.htm#vrs12">Hebrews 5:12</a>). He exhorts them: "leaving the word of the beginning of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let us go on to things more perfect, not laying again the foundation . . . of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, and <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>", and speaks of them as those who have been "once illuminated, have tasted also the <a href="07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="06553a.htm">gift</a>, and were made partakers of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>". It is clear that reference is made here to the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> initiation: <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> whereby the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was conferred, just as in <a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs38">Acts 2:38</a>. The <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is considered to be so well known to the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> that no further description is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. This account of the practice and teaching of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> <a href="12454c.htm">proves</a> that the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was no mere <a href="05673a.htm">examination</a> of those already <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, no mere profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> or renewal of <a href="02275a.htm">baptismal vows</a>. Nor was it something specially conferred upon the <a href="13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> and <a href="05490a.htm">Ephesians</a>. What was done to them was an instance of what was generally bestowed. Nor was it a mere bestowal of <a href="03588e.htm">charismata</a>; the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> sometimes produced extraordinary effects (speaking with divers tongues, etc.), but these were not necessarily the result of His being given. The practice and teaching of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at the present day preserve the primitive type: the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, the <a href="06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the <a href="12436b.htm">privileges</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">episcopate</a>. What further elements were handed down by <a href="15006b.htm">tradition</a> will be seen presently.</p>

<h3 id="B">Church Fathers</h3>

<p>In passing from <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> to the Fathers we naturally expect to find more definite answers to the various questions regarding the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. From both their practice and their teaching we learn that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> made use of a <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> distinct from <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; that this consisted of <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, anointing, and accompanying words; that by this <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was conferred upon those already <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and a mark or seal impressed upon their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; that, as a rule, in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> the <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> was a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whereas in the East he might be a simple <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>.</p>

<p>The Fathers considered that the <a href="13064b.htm">rites</a> of initiation (<a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, confirmation, and the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>) were instituted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but they did not enter into any minute discussion as to the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, place, and manner of the institution, at least of the second of these <a href="13064b.htm">rites</a>.</p>

<p>In examining the testimonies of the Fathers we should note that the word <em>confirmation</em> is not used to designate this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> during the first four centuries; but we meet with various other terms and phrases which quite clearly refer to it. Thus, it is styled "imposition of hands" (<em>manuum impositio, cheirothesia</em>), "unction", "chrism", "sealing", etc. Before the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> the Fathers do not make any explicit mention of confirmation as distinct from <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The fact that the two <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were conferred together may account for this silence.</p>

<p><a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0321.htm"><em>On Baptism</em> 6</a>) is the first to distinguish clearly the three acts of initiation: "After having come out of the laver, we are anointed thoroughly with a <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a> unction [<em>perungimur benedict&acirc; unctione</em>] according to the ancient rule . . . The unction runs bodily over us, but profits spiritually . . . . Next to this, the hand is laid upon us through the <a href="02599b.htm">blessing</a>, calling upon and inviting the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> [<em>dehinc manus imponitur per benedictionem advocans et invitans Spiriturn Sanctum</em>]."</p>

<p>Again (<a href="../fathers/0316.htm"><em>On the Resurrection of the Flesh</em> 8</a>): "The flesh is washed that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> may be made stainless. The flesh is anointed [<em>ungitur</em>] that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> may be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. The flesh is sealed [<em>signatur</em>] that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> may be fortified. The flesh is overshadowed by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> may be illuminated by the Spirit. The flesh is fed by the Body and Blood of Christ that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> may be fattened of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>."</p>

<p>And (<a href="../fathers/03121.htm"><em>Against Marcion</em> 1.14</a>): "But He [<a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>], indeed even at the present <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, neither rejected the water of the <a href="06608a.htm">Creator</a> with which He washes clean His own, nor the <a href="07421b.htm">oil</a> with which He anoints His own; . . . nor the <a href="01349d.htm">bread</a> with which He makes present [<em>repr&aelig;sentat</em>] His own very body, needing even in His own <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the beggarly elements of the <a href="06608a.htm">Creator</a>," <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> also tells how the <a href="04764a.htm">devil</a>, imitating the <a href="13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> initiation, sprinkles some and signs them as his soldiers on the forehead (<em>signat illic in frontibus milites suos</em> &#151; <a href="../fathers/0311.htm"><em>The Prescription Against Heretics</em> 40</a>).</p>

<p>Another great <a href="01181a.htm">African</a> Father speaks with equal clearness of confirmation. "Two <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>", says <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, "preside over the perfect birth of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, the one regenerating the man, which is <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the other communicating to him the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>" (<a href="../fathers/050672.htm">Epistle 72</a>).</p>

<p>"Anointed also must he be who is <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, in order that having received the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a>, that is the unction, he may be anointed of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../fathers/050670.htm">Epistle 70</a>).</p>

<p>"It was not fitting that [the <a href="13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>] should be <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, but only what was wanting, that was done by Peter and John; that <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> being made for them and <a href="07698a.htm">hands imposed</a>, the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should be invoked and poured forth upon them. Which also is now done among us; so that they who are <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> are presented to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> [<a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>] of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by our <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, they receive the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and are perfected with the seal [<em>signaculo</em>] of the <a href="08374c.htm">Lord</a>" (<a href="../fathers/050673.htm">Epistle 73</a>).</p>

<p>"Moreover, a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> is not born by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, when he receives the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; that being already born he may receive the <a href="07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as was done in the first man <a href="01129a.htm">Adam</a>. For <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> first formed him and breathed into his face the breath of life. For the <a href="07409a.htm">Spirit</a> cannot be received except there is first one to receive it. But the birth of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> is in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>" (<a href="../fathers/050674.htm">Epistle 74</a>).</p>

<p><a href="04375c.htm">Pope St. Cornelius</a> complains that <a href="11141a.htm">Novatus</a>, after having been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> on his sickbed, "did not receive the other things which ought to be partaken of according to the rule of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>--to be sealed, that is, by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> [<em>sphragisthenai ypo tou episkopou</em>] and not having received this, how did he receive the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>?" (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.43</a>).</p>

<p>In the fourth and fifth centuries the testimonies are naturally more frequent and clear. St. Hilary speaks of "the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and of the Spirit"; and he says that "the favor and <a href="06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> were, when the work of the <a href="10582c.htm">Law</a> ceased, to be given by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>" (In Matt., c. iv, c. xiv).</p>

<p><a href="04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> is the great <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern</a> authority on the subject, and his testimony is all the more important because he devoted several of his "Catecheses" to the instruction of <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> in the three <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which they were to receive on being initiated into the <a href="13295a.htm">Christian mysteries</a>. Nothing could be clearer than his language: "To you also after you had come up from the pool of the sacred streams, was given the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> [unction], the emblem of that wherewith <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> was anointed; and this is the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. . . This <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> ointment is no longer plain ointment nor so as to say common, after the invocation, but <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> gift; and by the presence of His <a href="06608a.htm">Godhead</a>, it causes in us the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. This symbolically anoints thy forehead, and thy other senses; and the body indeed is anointed with visible ointment, but the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is sanctified by the Holy and life-giving Spirit . . . . To you not in figure but in <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, because ye were in <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> anointed by the Spirit" (<a href="../fathers/310103.htm"><em>Mystagogical Catechesis</em> 3</a>).</p>

<p>And in the seventeenth <a href="05075b.htm">catechesis</a> on the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, speaks of the visit of Peter and John to communicate to the <a href="13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> the <a href="06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. Forget not the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>", he says to the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, "at the moment of your enlightenment; He is ready to mark your <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> with His seal [<em>sphragisai</em>] . . . He will give you the <a href="07170a.htm">heavenly</a> and divine seal [<em>sphragisai</em>] which makes the <a href="04764a.htm">devils</a> tremble; He will arm you for the fight; He will give you strength." <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, says <a href="11262b.htm">St. Optatus of Mileve</a>, "went down into the water, not that there was what could be cleansed in <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, but the water ought to go before the oil that was to supervene, in order to initiate and in order to fill up the mysteries of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; having been washed whilst He was held in John's hands, the order of the <a href="10662a.htm">mystery</a> is followed . . . . <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is opened whilst the Father anoints; the spiritual oil in the image of the <a href="05144b.htm">Dove</a> immediately descended and rested on His head, and poured on it oil, whence He took the name of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when He was anointed by <a href="06608a.htm">God the Father</a>; to whom that the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> might not seem to have been wanting, the voice of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is heard from a cloud, saying, This is my Son, of whom I have thought well; hear ye him" (De schism. Donat., I, iv, n. 7).</p>

<p><a href="05498a.htm">St. Ephraem Syrus</a> speaks of "the <a href="13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> of <a href="03696b.htm">Chrism</a> and <a href="02258b.htm">Baptism</a>" (Serm. xxvii); "oil also for a most sweet unguent, wherewith they who already have been initiated by <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> are sealed, and put on the armour of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>" (In Joel.)</p>

<p><a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> addressing the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> who had already been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> and anointed, says: "Thou hast received the spiritual seal, the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding . . . . Keep what thou hast received. <a href="06608a.htm">God the Father</a> has sealed thee; <a href="08374c.htm">Christ the Lord</a> has confirmed thee; and the Spirit has given the pledge in thy heart, as thou hast learned from what is read in the <a href="11567b.htm">Apostle</a>" (<a href="../fathers/3405.htm"><em>On the Mysteries</em> 7.42</a>).</p>

<p>The writer of the "De Sacramentis" (Inter Op. Ambros., lib. III, c. ii, n. 8) says that after the <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> immersion "the spiritual seal [<em>signaculum</em>] follows . . . when at the invocation of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> [<em>sacerdotis</em>] the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is infused".</p>

<p>The <a href="05395b.htm">Council of Elvira</a> <a href="04670a.htm">decreed</a> that those who had been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> privately in case of <a href="10733a.htm">necessity</a> should afterwards be taken to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> "to be made perfect by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>" (can. xxxviii, <a href="08718b.htm">Labbe</a>, I, 974).</p>

<p>And the <a href="12164c.htm">Council</a> of <a href="08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>: "Those who have been <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> from the <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> . . . are not to be received before they <a href="01455e.htm">anathematize</a> every <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> . . . and then after that, those who were called <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> among them, having learned the <a href="04478a.htm">creeds</a> of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and having been anointed with the <a href="03696b.htm">holy chrism</a>, shall so communicate of the holy mystery" (can. vii).

<p>The <a href="04308a.htm">Council of Constantinople</a> (381): "We receive the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and <a href="12174a.htm">Macedonians</a> . . . upon their giving in written statements and <a href="01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> every <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> . . . .

<p><a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> explains how the coming of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was companied with the <a href="14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a> in the first ages of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. "These were <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> suited to the times . . . .</p>

<p>Is it now expected that they upon whom <a href="07698a.htm">hands are laid</a>, should <a href="14776c.htm">speak with tongues</a>? Or when we <a href="07698a.htm">imposed our hand</a> upon these children, did each of you wait to see whether they would <a href="14776c.htm">speak with tongues</a>? and when he saw that they did not <a href="14776c.htm">speak with tongues</a>, was any of you so perverse of heart as to say 'These have not received the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>?' (<a href="../fathers/1701006.htm"><em>Tractate 6 on the Gospel of John</em></a>).</p>

<p>He also speaks in the same way about anointing: the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> "is in the genus of visible signs, sacrosanct like <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>" (<a href="../fathers/14092.htm"><em>Against Petilian</em> 2.104</a>; see Serm. ccxxvii, Ad Infantes in P.L., XXXVII, col. 1100; <a href="../fathers/130115.htm"><em>On the Holy Trinity</em> 15.46</a>); "Of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> it is written in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, how <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> anointed Him with the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, not indeed with visible oil, but with the <a href="06689a.htm">gift of grace</a>, which is signified by that visible unction wherewith the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> anoints the <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>".</p>

<p>The most explicit passage is in the letter of <a href="08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> to Decentius: "As regards the sealing of infants, it is clear that it is not lawful for it to be done by anyone but a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> [<em>non ab aliis quam ab episcopo fieri licere</em>]. For <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, though they be <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the second rank (second <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>), have not attained to the summit of the pontificate.

<p>Saint Leo in his fourth <a href="07448a.htm">sermon</a> on <a href="03724b.htm">Christ's Nativity</a> says to the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>: "Having been <a href="12714a.htm">regenerated</a> by <a href="02258b.htm">water</a> and the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, you have received the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> and the seal of <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="09238c.htm">life</a>" (<em>chrisma salutis et signaculum vitae &aelig;tern&aelig;,</em> &#151; P.L., LIV, col. 207).</p>

<p>The <a href="14574b.htm">Blessed Theodoret</a> commenting on the <a href="../bible/son001.htm">first chapter of the Canticle of Canticles</a> says: "Bring to thy recollection the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> of initiation, in which they who are perfected after the renunciation of the tyrant and the acknowledgment of the King, receive as a kind of royal seal the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> of the spiritual unction (<em>sphragida tina basiliken . . . tou pneumatikou myron to chrisma</em>) as made partakers in that typical ointment of the invisible grace of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>" (P.G., LXXXI, 60).</p>

<p>Among the <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> formerly attributed to Eusebius of Emesa, but now admitted to be the work of some <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of southern Gaul in the fifth century, is a long <a href="07448a.htm">homily</a> for <a href="15614b.htm">Whitsunday</a>: "The <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> who comes down with a life-giving descent upon the waters of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in the <a href="02274a.htm">font</a> bestows beauty unto innocence, in confirmation grants an increase unto grace.

<p>These passages suffice to show the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and practice of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> during the <a href="11560a.htm">patristic</a> age.</p>

<h3 id="C">Early Middle Ages</h3>

<p>After the great <a href="15047a.htm">Trinitarian</a> and <a href="14597a.htm">Christological</a> controversies had been decided, and the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> had been <a href="04675b.htm">defined</a>, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was able to devote attention to questions regarding the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the means of grace. At the same time, the <a href="09296a.htm">sacramentaries</a> were being drawn up, fixing the various <a href="13064b.htm">rites</a> in use.</p>

<p>With precision of practice came greater precision and completeness of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. "Chrisma", says <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>, "is in Latin, called 'unctio' and from it <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> receives His <a href="07421a.htm">name</a>, and <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> is sanctified after the laver [<em>lavacrum</em>]; for as in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> remission of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> is given, so by anointing [<em>unctio</em>] the sanctification of the Spirit is conferred. The <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> takes place in order that the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, being called by the <a href="02599b.htm">blessing</a>, may be invited [<em>per benedictionem advocatus invitetur Spiritus Sanctus</em>]; for after the bodies have been cleansed and <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a>, then does the <a href="11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> willingly come down from the Father" (Etym., VI, c.xix in P.L., LXXXII, col. 256).</p>

<p>The great <a href="01505a.htm">Anglo-Saxon</a> lights of the early <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> are equally explicit. "The confirmation of the newly <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>", says <a href="09270c.htm">Lingard</a> (Anglo-Saxon Church, I, p. 296), "was made an important part of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>. We repeatedly read of journeys undertaken by <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a> chiefly with this object . . . . Children were brought to him for confirmation from the secluded parts of the country; and he ministered to those who had been recently born again in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> the grace of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, 'placing his hand on the head of each, and anointing them with the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> which he had <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a> (<em>manum imponens super caput singulorum, liniens unctione consecrat&acirc; quam benedixerat</em>; Beda, "Vita Cuth.", c. xxix, xxxii in P.L., XCIV, Oper. Min., p. 277)."</p>

<p><a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> also in his letter to Odwin describes how the <a href="10742a.htm">neophyte</a>, after the reception of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the Eucharist, prepares to receive the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. "Last of all by the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of the hands</a> by the chief <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> [<em>summo sacerdote</em>] he receives the Spirit of the seven-fold grace to be strengthened by the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to fight against others" (De bapt. c&aelig;remon. in P.L., CI, col. 614).</p>

<p>It will be observed that in all these passages <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> is mentioned; <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore</a> and <a href="02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> mention anointing also. These may be taken as typical examples; the best authorities of this age combine the two <a href="03538b.htm">ceremonies</a>.</p>

<p>As to the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> of words used the greatest variety prevailed. The words accompanying the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> were generally a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> calling upon <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to send down the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and confer upon the <a href="10742a.htm">neophytes</a> the seven <a href="06553a.htm">gifts</a>. In the Gregorian Sacramentary no words at all are assigned to the anointing; but it is clear that the anointing must be taken in connection with the words belonging to the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. Where special words are assigned they sometimes resemble the Greek <a href="06141a.htm">formulary</a> (<em>signum Christi in vitam &aelig;ternam</em>, etc.), or are indicative, like the present formula (<em>signo, consigno, confirmo</em>), or imperative (<em>accipe signum</em>, etc.), or deprecatory (<em>confirmet vos Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus</em>, etc.). <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore</a> is clearly in favor of a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>: "We can receive the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but we cannot give Him: that He may be given, we call upon <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" (De Off. Eccl., II, c. xxvi in P.L., LXXXIII, col. 823).</p>

<p>In contrast with this diversity as to the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> there is complete agreement that the sole <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> is a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Of course this refers only to the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>. The writers appeal to the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> (e.g. <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore</a>, "De Off. Eccl.", II, c. xxvi; <a href="02384a.htm">St. Bede</a>, "In Act. Apost." in P.L., XCII, col. 961; "Vit. Cuth.", c. xxix); but they do not examine the reason why the power is reserved to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, nor do they discuss the question of the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> and mode of the institution of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>.</p>

<h3 id="D">Scholastic theology</h3>

<p>The teaching of the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> shows a marked advance upon that of the early <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The decision as to the number of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> involved the clear distinction of confirmation from <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and at the same time the more exact definition of what constitutes a <em>sacrament</em> led to the discussion of the institution of confirmation, its <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="06137b.htm">form</a>, <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a>, and effects, especially the <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> impressed.</p>

<p>We can follow the development through the labors of <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> his successor, <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, <a href="07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (Sent., IV, dist. vii); then branching out into the two distinct schools of <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (<a href="01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> and <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>) and <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (<a href="01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, and <a href="05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>). As we shall see, the clearness with which the various questions were set forth by no means produced unanimity; rather it served to bring out the uncertainty with regard to them all. The writers start from the fact that there was in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> a <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of anointing with <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> accompanied with the words: "I sign thee with the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>", etc.; this <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was performed by a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> only, and could not be repeated. When they came to examine the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> underlying this practice they all admitted that it was a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, though in the earlier writers the word <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> had not yet acquired a distinct technical meaning. So strongly did they insist upon the principle <em>Lex orandi, lex credendi</em>, that they took for granted that the anointing must be the <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a>, and the words "I sign thee", etc., the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a>, and that no one but a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> could be the valid <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a>. But when they came to justify this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> by the authority of <a href="../bible.html">Scripture</a> they encountered the difficulty that no mention is made there either of the anointing or of the words; indeed nothing is said of the institution of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> at all. What could be the meaning of this silence? How could it be explained?</p>

<p><em>(a) The institution of the sacrament</em></p>

<p>Regarding the institution there were three opinions. The <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> School taught that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself was the immediate author of confirmation. Earlier writers (e.g. <a href="07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, "De Sacram.", ii, and <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, "Sent.", IV, dist. vii) held that it was instituted by the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> through the instrumentality of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> also maintained that the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was the author, but that He acted either through the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> or through the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> after the death of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> says,</p>

<blockquote><p>Concerning the institution of this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, there are two opinions: some say that it was instituted neither by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> nor by His <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, but later on in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> at a certain council [Meaux, 845; this was the opinion of <a href="01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, Summ., iv, q. 9, m.], whereas others said that it was instituted by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. But this cannot be the case, because the institution of a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> belongs to the power of excellence which is proper to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> alone. And therefore we must hold that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, not by showing it [<em>exhibendo</em>] but by promising it, according to the text (<a href="../bible/joh016.htm#vrs7">John 16:7</a>), "If I go not, the <a href="11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you." And this because in this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> the fullness of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is given, which was not to be given before <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="12789a.htm">resurrection</a> and <a href="01767a.htm">ascension</a>, according to the text (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs39">John 7:39</a>), "As yet the Spirit was not given, because <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet glorified." (<a href="../summa/4072.htm#article1"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.72.1</a>).</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be noticed that the <a href="14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a> hesitates a little about the direct institution by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<em>non exhibendo, sed promittendo</em>). In his earlier work (In Sent., IV, dist. vii, q. 1) he had said plainly that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> had instituted the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> and had Himself administered it (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm">Matthew 19</a>). In this opinion the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> was still under the influence of his master, Albert, who went so far as to hold that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> had specified the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> and the words, "I sign thee", etc. (In Sent., IV, dist. vii, a. 2).</p>

<p>The opinion of <a href="01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, referred to by <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, was as follows: the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> conferred the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by mere <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>; this <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a>, which was not properly a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, was continued until the ninth century, when the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> inspired the Fathers of the Council of Meaux in the choice of the <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="06137b.htm">form</a>, and endowed these with <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> efficacy (<em>Spiritu Sancto instigante et virtutem sanctificandi pr&aelig;stante</em>). He was led to this extraordinary view (which he states as merely personal) by the fact that no mention is made in <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> either of the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> or of the words; and as these were undoubtedly the <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a> they could only have been introduced by Divine authority.</p>

<p>His <a href="05029a.htm">disciple</a>, <a href="02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, agreed in rejecting the institution by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> or His <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, and in attributing it to the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; but he set back the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> to the age of "the <a href="01641a.htm">successors</a> of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>" (In Sent., IV, dist. vii, art. 1). However, like his friendly rival <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, he also modified his view in a later work viloquium, p. vi. c. 4) where he says that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> instituted all the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, though in different ways; "some by hinting at them and initiating them [<em>insinuando et initiando</em>], as confirmation and <a href="05716a.htm">extreme unction</a>". <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a> seems to have felt the weight of the authority of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> opinion, for he does not express himself clearly in favor of the views of his own order. He says that the <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> was instituted by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>? the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>?); that it was instituted when <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> pronounced the words, "Receive ye the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>", or on the day of Pentecost, but this may refer not to the <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> but to the thing signified, viz. the <a href="06553a.htm">gift</a> of the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (In Sent., IV, dist. vii, q. 1; dist. ii, q. 1). The Fathers of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, as said above, did not expressly decide the question, but as they <a href="04675b.htm">defined</a> that all the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were instituted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> teaching has prevailed. We shall see, however, that this is capable of many different meanings.</p>

<p><em>(b) The question of matter and form</em></p>

<p>The question of the institution of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is intimately bound up with the determination of the <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and <a href="06137b.htm">form</a>. All agreed that these consisted of the anointing (including the act of placing the hand upon the candidate) and the words, "I sign thee", or "I confirm thee", etc. Were this action and these words of <a href="06608a.htm">Divine</a>, or of <a href="01648b.htm">Apostolic</a>, or of merely <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> origin? St. Albertus held that both were ordained by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself; others that they were the work of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; but the common opinion was that they were of <a href="01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> origin. <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> was of opinion that the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> actually made use of <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> and the words, <em>Consigno te</em>, etc., and that they did so by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> command. The silence of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> need not surprise us, he says, "for the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> observed many things in the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are not handed down by the <a href="13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>" (<a href="../summa/4072.htm#article3"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.72.3</a>).</p>

<p><em>(c) The reservation of the rite to the bishops</em></p>

<p>In <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the reservation of the <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> appeal to the example of <a href="../bible/act008.htm">Acts 8</a>; and they go on to explain that as the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> is a sort of completion of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> it is fitting that it should be conferred by "one who has the highest power [<em>summam potestatem</em>] in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>" (<a href="../summa/4072.htm#article11"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.72.11</a>). They were aware, however, that in the primitive <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> simple <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> sometimes administered the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. This they accounted for by the fewness of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and they recognized that the validity of such administration (unlike the case of <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>) is a mere matter of <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. "The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> holds the fullness of power in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, whence he can confer upon certain of the inferior orders things which belong to the higher orders . . . . And out of the fullness of this power the <a href="06780a.htm">blessed pope Gregory</a> granted that simple <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> conferred this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>" (<a href="../summa/4072.htm#article11"><em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> III.72.11</a>).</p>

<h3 id="E">The Council of Trent</h3>

<p>The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not decide the questions discussed by the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>. But the <a href="04675b.htm">definition</a> that "all the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were instituted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>" (Sess. VII, can. i), excluded the opinion that the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was the author of confirmation. Still, nothing was said about the mode of institution--whether immediate or mediate, generic or specific. The post-Tridintine <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> have almost unanimously taught that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself was the immediate author of all the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and so of confirmation (cf. <a href="09418b.htm">De Lugo</a>, "De Sacram. in Gen.", disp. vii, sect. 1; <a href="14800a.htm">Tourn&eacute;ly</a>, "De Sacram. in Gen.", q. v, a. 1). "But the historical studies of the seventeenth century <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> authors to restrict the action of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the institution of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to the determination of the spiritual effect, leaving the choice of the <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> to the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>." (Pourrat, La th&eacute;ologie sacramentaire, p. 313.) That is to say, in the case of confirmation, <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> bestowed upon the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> the power of giving the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but He did not specify the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> by which this <a href="06553a.htm">gift</a> should be conferred; the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, acting under Divine guidance, fixed upon the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, the anointing, and the appropriate words. Further information on this important and difficult question will be found in the article <a href="13295a.htm">SACRAMENTS</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Confirmation in the British and Irish Churches</h2>

<p>In his famous "Confession" (p. clxxxiv) <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> refers to himself as the first to administer confirmation in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The term here used (<em>populi consummatio</em>; cf. <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, <em>ut signaculo dominico consummentur</em>, <a href="../fathers/050673.htm">Epistle 73, no. 9</a>) is rendered by <em>nocosmad, cosmait</em> (<em>confirmabat, confirmatio</em>) in a very ancient <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="07448a.htm">homily</a> on <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> found in the fourteenth century, "Leabar Breac". In the same work (II, 550-51) a Latin preface to an ancient <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> chronological tract says: <em>Debemus scire quo tempore Patriacius sanctus episcopus atque pr&aelig;ceptor maximus Scotorum inchoavit . . . sanctificare et consecrare, et consummare</em>, i.e. "we ought to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> at what <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> <a href="11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and greatest teacher of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>, began to come to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> . . . to sanctify and <a href="11279a.htm">ordain</a> and confirm".</p>

<p>From the same "Leabar Breac" Sylvester Malone quotes the following account of confirmation which exhibits an accurate <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> on the part of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>: "Confirmation or <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> is the perfection of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, not that they are not distinct and different. Confirmation could not be given in the absence of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; nor do the effects of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> depend on confirmation, nor are they lost till death. Just as the natural birth takes place at once so does the spiritual <a href="12714a.htm">regeneration</a> in like manner, but it finds, however, its perfection in confirmation" (Church History of Ireland, Dublin, 1880, I, p. 149).</p>

<p>It is in the light of these venerable texts, which quite probably antedate the year 1000, that we must interpret the well-known reference of <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> to the temporary disuse of confirmation in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (Vita Malachi&aelig;), c. iv, in Acta SS., Nov., 1I, 145). He relates that <a href="09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a> (b. about 1095) introduced the practices of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a> into all the churches of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and mentions especially "the most wholesome usage of confession, the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of confirmation and the <a href="04332a.htm">contract</a> of marriage, all of which were either unknown or neglected". These <a href="09565a.htm">Malachy</a> restored (<em>de novo instituit</em>).</p>

<p>The <a href="15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of Hywel Dda suppose for children of seven years and upwards a religious <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> that can hardly be anything else than confirmation. Moreover, the <a href="15532a.htm">Welsh</a> term for this <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, <em>Bedydd Esgob</em>, i.e. <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, implies that it was always performed by a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and was a complement (<em>consummatio</em>) of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <a href="06568d.htm">Gerald Barry</a> notes that the whole people of <a href="15532a.htm">Wales</a> were more eager than any other nation to obtain episcopal confirmation and the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> by which the Spirit was given.</p>

<p>The practice in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> has already been illustrated by facts from the life of <a href="04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert</a>. One of the oldest <em>ordines</em>, or <a href="12395b.htm">prescriptions</a> for administering the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>, is found in the <a href="12231a.htm">Pontifical</a> of Egbert, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15733b.htm">York</a> (d. 766). The <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> is practically the same as that used at present; the <a href="06137b.htm">form</a>, however, is: "receive the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the holy cross</a> with the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> unto <a href="09238c.htm">life</a> everlasting." Among the <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a> are: <em>modo ligandi sunt</em>, i.e. the head of the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> confirmed is to be bound with a fillet; and <em>modo communicandi sunt de sacrificio</em>, i.e. they are to receive <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> (<a href="09721a.htm">Mart&egrave;ne</a>).</p>

<p>It was especially during the thirteenth century that vigorous measures were taken to secure the proper administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a>. In general, the <a href="14388a.htm">councils and synods</a> direct the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to admonish the people regarding the confirmation of their children. The age limit, however, varies considerably. Thus the <a href="14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a> (1240) <a href="04670a.htm">decreed</a> that <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> who neglected to have their child confirmed within a year after birth should be forbidden to enter the church. The <a href="14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="05708a.htm">Exeter</a> (1287) enacted that children should be confirmed within three years from birth, otherwise the <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> were to <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> on bread and water until they complied with the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. At the <a href="14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="05211a.htm">Durham</a> (1217? Cf. Wilkins, loc. cit. below) the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> was extended to the seventh year.</p>

<p>Other <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> were: that no one should be admitted to <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> who had not been confirmed (Council of Lambeth, 1281); that neither father nor mother nor stepparent should act as sponsor (London, 1200); that children to be confirmed must bring "fillets or bands of sufficient length and width", and that they must be brought to the church the third day after confirmation to have their foreheads washed by the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> out of reverence for the <a href="03696b.htm">holy chrism</a> (Oxford, 1222); that a male sponsor should stand for the boys and a <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> sponsor for the girls (Provincial Synod of <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, 1225); that adults must confess before being confirmed (Constitution of <a href="05294a.htm">St. Edmund of Canterbury</a>, about 1236).</p>

<p>Several of the above-named <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> emphasize the fact that confirmation produces spiritual cognation and that the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> cannot be received more than once. The legislation of the <a href="14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="05708a.htm">Exeter</a> is especially full and detailed (see Wilkins, Concilia Magn&aelig; Brittanni&aelig; et Hiberni&aelig;, London, 1734).</p>

<p>Among the <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> issued in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> after the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> may be cited: no one other than a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> should administer confirmation; the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had not <a href="04696b.htm">delegated</a> this episcopal function to any one (Synod of Armagh, 1614); the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> should be taught that confirmation cannot be reiterated and that its reception should be preceded by <a href="11618c.htm">sacramental confession</a> (Synod of <a href="15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, 1632).</p>

<h2 id="section4">In the American colonies</h2>

<p>Previous to the establishment of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in North America died without having received confirmation. In some portions of what is now the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> was administered by <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the neighboring French and Spanish possessions; in others, by missionary <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> with <a href="04696b.htm">delegation</a> from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.</p>

<p>Bishop Cabezas de Altimirano of Santiago de Cuba, on his visitation of <a href="06115b.htm">Florida</a>, confirmed (25 March, 1606) a large number, probably the first administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> territory. In 1655, Don Diego de Rebolledo, Governor of <a href="06115b.htm">Florida</a>, urged the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> to ask the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to make St. Augustine an <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, or to make <a href="06115b.htm">Florida</a> a <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> so that there might be a local superior and that the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> might receive the Sacrament of Confirmation; but nothing came of the <a href="11777a.htm">petition</a>. Bishop Calderon of Santiago visited <a href="06115b.htm">Florida</a> in 1647 and confirmed 13,152 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, including <a href="07747a.htm">Indians</a> and whites. Other instances are the <a href="15479a.htm">visitations</a> of Bishop de Velasco (1735-6) and Bishop Morel (1763). Subsequently, Dr. Peter Camps, missionary Apostolic, received from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> special <a href="05749a.htm">faculties</a> for confirmation.</p>

<p>In <a href="11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, during the seventeenth century, the <a href="04577a.htm">custos</a> of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> confirmed by <a href="04696b.htm">delegation</a> from <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and <a href="01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a>. In 1760, Bishop Tamaron of <a href="05208c.htm">Durango</a> visited the missions of <a href="11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> and confirmed 11,271 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. Bishop Tejada of <a href="07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a> administered (1759) confirmation at San Fernando, now <a href="13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>, and Bishop de Pontbriand at Ft. Presentation (Ogdensburg, N.Y.) in 1752.</p>

<p>The need of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to administer the <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> in <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> was urged by <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> <a href="03564a.htm">Challoner</a> in a report to the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, 2 Aug., 1763. Writing to his agent at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Rev. Dr. Stonor, 12 Sept., 1766, he says: "there be so many thousands there that live and die without Confirmation"; and in another letter, 4 June, 1771: "It is a lamentable thing that such a multitude have to live and die always deprived of the Sacrament of Confirmation." Cardinal Castelli wrote, 7 Sept., 1771, to <a href="02778b.htm">Bishop Briand</a> of Quebec asking him to supply the need of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. In 1783 the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> petitioned <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the appointment of a superior with the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="05749a.htm">faculties</a> "that our <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> living in many dangers, may be no longer deprived of the Sacrament of Confirmation . . . . " On 6 June, 1784, <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> appointed <a href="03381b.htm">Rev. John Carroll</a> as superior of the mission and empowered him to administer confirmation (<a href="13753b.htm">Shea</a>, Life and Times of Archbishop Carroll, New York, 1888; cf. Hughes in Am. Eccl. Review, XXVIII, 23).</p>

<h2 id="section5">Confirmation among non-Catholics</h2>

<p>The <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant Reformers</a>, influenced by their rejection of all that could not be clearly <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> from <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and by their doctrine of <a href="08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> only, refused to admit that confirmation was a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> (<a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, De Capt. Babyl., VII, p. 501). According to the Confession of Augsburg, it was instituted by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and it has not the promise of the <a href="06689a.htm">grace of God</a>. <a href="10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> (Loci Comm., p. 48) taught that it was a vain <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, and was formerly nothing but a <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a> in which those who were approaching adolescence gave an account of their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> before the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; and that the <a href="10326a.htm">minister</a> was not a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> only, but any <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> whatsoever (Lib. Ref. ad Colonien.).</p>

<p>These four points were condemned by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (supra I; cf. <a href="14565b.htm">A. Theiner</a>, Acta Genuina SS. &OElig;cum. Conc. Trid., I, p. 383 sqq.). Nevertheless the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran Churches</a> retain some sort of confirmation to the present day. It consists of the <a href="05673a.htm">examination</a> of the candidate in <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> by the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> or members of the consistory, and the renewal by the candidate of the profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> made for him at the time of his <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> by his godparents. How the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> properly <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> can alone be said to "give" confirmation does not appear. The <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> holds that "Confirmation is not to be counted for a <a href="13295a.htm">sacrament</a> of the Gospel . . . for it has not the like <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> [<em>sacramentorum eandem rationem</em>] with <a href="02258b.htm">Baptism</a> and the Lord's Supper, for it has not any visible sign or <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" (Art. xxv). But, like the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran Churches</a>, it retains "the Confirmation of children, by examining them of their <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in their <a href="01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> and joining thereto the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> for them" (Homily on Common Prayer and Sacraments, p. 300). The <a href="13064b.htm">rite</a> of confirmation has undergone various changes in the different <a href="02678c.htm">prayer books</a> (see <a href="02678c.htm">BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER</a>). From these it can be seen how the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> has varied between the complete rejection of the <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and practice, and a near approach to these. Testimonies could easily be quoted for either of these opinions. The wording of Art. xxv left a loophole which the Ritualistic party has made good use of. Even some <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, as stated above, have admitted that confirmation "has not any visible sign or <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>"; the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, the anointing, and the words used being all of them "ordained of" the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
