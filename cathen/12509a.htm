<p>(PROVIDENTIENSIS)</p>

<p>Co-extensive with the <a href="13020a.htm">State of Rhode Island</a>. When erected (17 Feb., 1872) it included also that portion of south-eastern <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> which has since 14 March, 1904, been set off as the <a href="05771a.htm">Diocese of Fall River</a>. It thus embraces an entire state, the majority of whose population is <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> (State Census, 1905). The city of Providence was the residence of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07144a.htm">Hartford</a> from the establishment of that <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> in 1844 (see <a href="07144a.htm">DIOCESE OF HARTFORD</a>). In 1847 a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> authorizing this transfer of residence was obtained from the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>.</p>

<p>The first appearance of <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> worship in the colony of <a href="13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a> was in the latter part of 1780, when the French army under Rochambeau encamped at Newport and Providence. It is known that there were several <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> with the army who often said <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> publicly. Shortly afterwards (Feb., 1783) the colonial legislature repealed the act disfranchising <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholics</a>. The <a href="12627a.htm">Negro</a> uprising in <a href="07044a.htm">Guadeloupe</a>, which followed the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, drove several <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> (French) to Newport and <a href="02790b.htm">Bristol</a>. In Newport also about 1808 there died one Joseph Wiseman, Vice-Consul to His <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Majesty of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The building of Fort Adams at Newport and the beginnings of the cotton-mill industry in Pawtucket brought in some <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to these parts in the twenties. The first <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> assigned to Rhode Island was the Rev. Robert Woodley in 1828. The first land owned in the state for church purposes was purchased in Newport in 1828. During the thirties the growth was gradual and fluctuating. It was only in November, 1837, that Mass was said for the first time in Providence in a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church built for that purpose. In 1842 another <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> was erected in Providence, but when Bishop Tyler (see <a href="07144a.htm">HARTFORD</a>) died in June, 1849, there were but six small <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the state. The famine in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (1848) brought thousands to these parts who found work in the factories, foundries, machine shops, and jewelry shops then beginning to flourish in <a href="13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a>. During the fifties most of the still large and important English-speaking <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were established; several costly churches were attempted; an <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> was founded; and a few very primitive <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were begun. The <a href="08677a.htm">Knownothing</a> Movement in March, 1855, disturbed <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> because of threats against the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>. In the sixties the growth was appreciable but not extraordinary, and most of the congregations were in <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> with very little to show for it &mdash; an evidence of their extreme poverty. When Bishop McFarland left Providence in 1872 to fix his residence at <a href="07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, he left behind him a poor <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and episcopal residence and a <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> of $16,000 &mdash; so unable or so indifferent was his flock to second his admirable <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and devotion.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Thomas Francis Hendricken, the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Providence, was born in Kilkenny 5 May, 1827. He made his preliminary studies at St. Kieran's College, Kilkenny, which he attended in 1844, He took up the study of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="10087b.htm">Maynooth</a> in 1847 and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Bishop O'Reilly of <a href="07144a.htm">Hartford</a> at <a href="01314b.htm">All Hallows College</a> in 1851. After a short period as assistant and <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of a small <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> he was transferred to Waterbury, Conn., where he proved to be a successful church builder. He transformed the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> and seemed to be equal to any financial burden. Perhaps because of this remarkable talent he recommended himself to Bishop McFarland as the man best fitted for the heavy labours that then awaited the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Providence. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Providence on April 28, 1872, by Archbishop McCloskey of New York, the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the province. He set to work at once to build an episcopal residence and a suitable <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He had no sooner begun than the panic set in. Nothing daunted, and in spite of failing health, he began a tour of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> to collect, and succeeded in raising some hundreds of thousands of dollars in a few years, so that when he died (May, 1886) the new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was almost completed without any <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> encumbering it. It was during his episcopate that the <a href="12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> began to come to the diocese in considerable numbers, first to Woonsocket and then to the various mill towns along the little streams of the Blackstone and the Pawtucket, and above all to Fall River. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, engrossed with other things, did not realize apparently the magnitude of the problem, and his attempts to deal with it were not infrequently a <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a> of anxiety and pain to himself and others.</p>

<p>Rt. Rev. Matthew Harkins succeeded Bishop Hendricken after an interval of eleven months. Born in <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a> 17 Nov., 1845, <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at the Boston Latin School, Holy Cross College, and <a href="05138a.htm">Douai College</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, he made his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at Saint Sulpice (Paris), where he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1869. The <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> took place while he was continuing his studies in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Made <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Arlington in 1876, he was transferred to St. James' <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>, in 1884, in succession to Bishop Healy of <a href="12287a.htm">Portland</a> and Archbishop Williams of <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>, its former <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>. On the 14 April, 1887, Bishop Harkins was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the new (uncompleted) Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul in Providence which had first been opened a year before for the obsequies of his predecessor. A man of wide reading, acute mind, and judicial temperament, a lover of order and method, he has devoted himself to the task of organizing his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He has particularly made his own the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> charities. The <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> begun in 1851, transferred in 1862, had always obtained a precarious income from fairs and donations, and for these he substituted <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> assessments. Through the generosity of Joseph Banigan the Home for the Aged in Pawtucket was built in 1881. Mr. Banigan also built the large St. Maria Working Girls' Home in Providence in 1894 at a cost of $80,000, and either gave in his lifetime or left by will (1897) sums of $25,000 or more to nearly every <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> charity. St. Joseph's Hospital was begun in 1891 and the <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> Infant Asylum in the following year; the Working Boys' Home began in 1897, the House of the Good Shepherd in 1904, Nazareth Home (a day-nursery, that also supplies nurses in the homes of the poor) in 1906. In Woonsocket and Newport and other parts of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> similar <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> have been erected at the suggestion and advice of Bishop Harkins. Almost twenty <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> out of a total of seventy-nine are exclusively <a href="12598a.htm">French Canadian</a>, while there are a few small <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of mixed French and English-speaking <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In the last fifteen years (1911) the <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a> have come to Providence and the vicinity in large numbers, so that now there are perhaps between thirty and forty thousand of them in the diocese. Two churches for the <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a> were dedicated in Providence in 1910 and other smaller <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> provide for their needs in the outlying districts. The four colonies of Poles have four Polish <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, while the <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> have one in Providence. One Syrian <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> in Central Falls <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> to some of the Orientais in these parts.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Parochial <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> are established in the greater number of the English-speaking <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the cities. Thus out of seventeen English-speaking <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in Providence, nine have large and well-equipped <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>; of the four in Pawtucket, three have <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>; the three <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in Newport have <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The others are either very small or heavily in <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> or unable to procure suitable teachers. Among the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, with whom the church <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> is a patriotic as well as a religious institution, it is rare to find a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> without its <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. Religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> are usually the teachers (in ten <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, the <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>); in only three are there Brothers for the larger boys. La Salle Academy, a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> High School of which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is president, obtained a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> charter from the state (1910). The teachers are <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> (for the classics) and <a href="08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>. It is conveniently situated in Providence. One day high school (St. Francis Xavier's Academy) and two boarding <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> (Bayview, <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, and Elmhurst, Religious of the Sacred Heart) provide similar training for the girls. In all there are some eighteen thousand children receiving <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training in the diocese.</p>

<p>A <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> weekly paper, the "Providence Visitor", sanctioned by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and edited by <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, has a considerable influence among the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the state. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Club for men, established in 1909, has its own home in Providence and a large and influential membership. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Woman's Club, established in 1901, has a membership of four hundred and is noted for considerable literary and social activity. Although in a numerical majority, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> do not exert any perceptible influence on public life. They receive their share of elective offices, the last two governors, the one a democrat, the other a republican, being <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Frequently the mayors and other city officials are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. There has, however, never been a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> judge of a superior court.</p>

<p>The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> until recently was nearly exclusively <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. From 1878 to 1899 the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had St. Joseph's parish in Providence, but left there, as there was no prospect of opening a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a>. Now various small communities of men have <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in outlying districts, Westerly (1905, <a href="09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a>), Portsmouth (1907, <a href="07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a>), Natick (1899, Sacred Heart Fathers); in 1910 the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> began a new <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> between Pawtucket and Providence. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, approximately from 250,000 to 275,000, live for the most part in the densely inhabited Providence County, only eighteen <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and several of them very small, existing in the four other counties of the state, while there are sixty-one in Providence county.</p>
