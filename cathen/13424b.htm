<p>(Sancti Antonii).</p>

<p>Comprises all that portion of the <a href="14543a.htm">State of Texas</a> between the Colorado and Rio Grande Rivers, except the land south of the Arroyo de los Hermanos, on the Rio Grande, and the Counties of Live Oak, Bee, Goliad, and Refugio. It embraces an area of about 90,909 square miles.</p>

<p>The first religious ministrations in this territory of which we have definite historical information where those of the French secular and <a href="12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who accompanied the expedition of La Salle. They entered Matagorda Bay in January, 1685. La Salle built a fort called Fort St. Louis on the spot subsequently occupied by the Bahia Mission; a <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> was constructed in the fort, and for two years five <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> laboured here: Fathers <a href="10172b.htm">Zenobius Membr&eacute;</a>, Maxime Le Clercq, and Anastasius Douay, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and Fathers Chefdeville and Cavelier, <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>. They finally abandoned <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a> and returned to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Shortly after their departure, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> from the apostolic school of <a href="12601b.htm">Quer&eacute;taro</a> and <a href="15740a.htm">Zacatecas</a> founded missions on the Rio Grande. The pioneer <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> was the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Father Damian Mazanet, who accompanied the expedition of Alonzo de Le&oacute;n in 1689. He found the field so promising that he invoked the help of the civil and <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> to establish a permanent mission beyond the Rio Grande. In 1690 Father Mazanet crossed the Rio Grande, accompanied by Fathers Michael Fontcubierto, Francis Casanas, Anthony Borday, and Anthony Pereira. The friendly Indians (Asinais) received them with <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a>, and the Mission of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> de las Tejas was established. In 1691, and again in 1700, additional missionaries arrived from Mexico; four more missions were established, and these were maintained till 1718, when the chief mission was transferred to San Antonio.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1703 the Mission of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> Solano was established on the banks of the Rio Grande. It was transferred in 1712 to San Ildefonso; thence, in 1713, it was moved to San Jos&eacute; on the Rio Grande, and, finally, in 1718 to the San Antonio River, where it was established under the title of San Antonio de Valero. This last move was made by order of the Marquess de Valero, Viceroy of New Spain. The mission was then under the direction of Fray Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares. In the year 1716 nine <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> from <a href="12601b.htm">Quer&eacute;taro</a> and <a href="15740a.htm">Zacatecas</a>, with <a href="09657b.htm">Father Antonio Margil de Jes&uacute;s</a> as superior, established six Missions in the most northerly part of the Province of <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>, and a few years afterwards another was built near the Presidio of Nuestra Senora del Pilar de los Adayes, seven leagues from the fort of <a href="10710a.htm">Natchitoches</a>, in <a href="09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. The mission of La Pur&iacute;sima Conc&eacute;pcion was founded in 1716, among the Sanipaos, Tocanes and other tribes. A massive stone church was erected in 1731, and is still in a fair state of preservation and is used for Divine Worship. It is situated one mile south of the present city of San Antonio. In 1729 the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> ordered four hundred <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> to be transferred from the <a href="03243a.htm">Canary Islands</a> to <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>. Fourteen <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> arrived the next year, and the city of San Fernando was founded near the fort and mission of San Antonio de Valero. A <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> was at once raised, to serve till a proper <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church could be built. The two settlements in course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> became consolidated and the modern city of San Antonio is the result. In 1744 the cornerstone of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Fernando was laid, and on 6 November, 1749, the building was dedicated to Divine worship. A portion of this edifice still stands and serves as the sanctuary of the present Cathedral of San Fernando.</p>

<p>The Province of <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a> was subject to the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a> till December, 1777, when it became part of the newly-erected Diocese of Nuevo Le&oacute;n, or Linares. The Indian missions continued under the care of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, many of whom won the crown of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. In 1777 Fray Pedro Ram&iacute;rez, missionary at San Jos&eacute;, was president of all the <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a> missions, and by an Indult of <a href="04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> was empowered to administer confirmation in all parts of <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>. On 10 April, 1794, Don Pedro de Nava, commandant-general of the north-eastern interior provinces, of which <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a> formed a part, published a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> by which all the missions within his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> were secularized. Nevertheless the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in many instances remained as <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>, though they received their <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, like other <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. Their missions subsisted in a flourishing state till about 1813, when they were suppressed by the Spanish Government, and the Indians dispersed. In 1839, <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> established a <a href="12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a> in <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a> and appointed the Very Rev. J. Timon <a href="12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>. In 1840 the <a href="11208a.htm">Rev. John M. Odin</a> visited <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a> as vice-prefect Apostolic. Through his efforts, warmly supported by the minister of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, de Saligny, the congress confirmed to "the Chief Pastor of the <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> in the Republic of <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>" the churches of San Fernando, the Alamo (San Antonio de Valero), La Pur&iacute;sima Conc&eacute;pcion, San Jos&eacute;, San Juan Capistrano, San Francisco de la Espada, Goliad, <a href="15412b.htm">Victoria</a> and Rufugio, with their grounds, the latter not to exceed fifteen acres each.</p>

<p>A <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> erecting the Republic of <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a> into a <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> was published by <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> on 10 July, 1841, and the <a href="11208a.htm">Right Rev. John M. Odin</a> was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04008a.htm">Claudiopolis</a> and assigned to the vicariate. Religion, which had languished since the secularization of the missions and the departure of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, now began to revive. New churches were built, and some of the old mission buildings restored; <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> were introduced from <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>; <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> were established. Colonists from <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and various parts of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> began to pour in and settle upon the wide and fertile plains of eastern and southern <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>. A large proportion of the <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> immigrants were <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Germans founded prosperous settlements at New Braunfels in 1844, at Castroville in 1845, and later at D'Hanis, Fredericksburg, High Hill, and other places. A colony of Poles, led by the Rev. Leopold Moczygemba, O.F.M., founded the thriving settlement of Panna Maria in 1854; another Polish colony was established at St. Hedwig, near San Antonio. <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> planted flourishing settlements at Fayetteville, Praha, Moulton, Shiner, and other points. In all these places there are now fine churches and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and an influential and constantly increasing <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1847 the <a href="06372a.htm">Diocese of Galveston</a> was established, its territory embracing the whole <a href="14543a.htm">State of Texas</a>. On 3 September, 1874, this immense territory was divided, ecclesiastically, and the Diocese of San Antonio was created by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Anthony Dominic Pellicer, the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was a native of St. Augustine, Florida; b. 7 Dec., 1824, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, 8 Dec., 1874; d. 14 April, 1880. John Claudius Neraz, second <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was b. 12 Jan., 1828, at Anse, Department of the Rhone, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; he laboured for thirty years on the missions in eastern and southern <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of San Fernando, San Antonio, 8 May, 1881, and d. 15 Nov., 1894. John Anthony Forest, third <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was b. 25 December, 1838, at St. Martin, Canton St. Germain, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Like his predecessor, he spent the whole of his <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> life in arduous missionary work in southern <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>, often helping to build churches with his own hands. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 28 October, 1895, and d. 11 March, 1911, deeply <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> and regretted by all classes. John William Shaw, the present <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was b. At Mobile, <a href="01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, in 1863, made his principal studies in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> on 26 May, 1888. On 14 April, 1910, in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03407c.htm">Castabala</a> and coadjutor with the right of succession to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of San Antonio. On 18 May, 1910, he was appointed administrator of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, owing to the ill-health of Bishop Forest, at whose death his succeeded to the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>.</p>

<p>San Antonio is the largest city in <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>; it was the capital of the Spanish province and from and days of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missions has been a centre of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> activity in religious, <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a>, and charitable work. With a population of 100,000, it has thirteen <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Four of these, including the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of San Fernando, are for the Mexican, or Spanish-speaking population; two are for the English-speaking; two English and German, one German, one Polish, one <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a>, and two for the coloured population. There are also several hundred <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>, scattered among the various <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The city is the headquarters of several religious congregations whose works extend to neighbouring <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and states, and to the <a href="10250b.htm">Republic of Mexico</a>. The <a href="11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, who since their introduction by <a href="11208a.htm">Bishop Odin</a> in 1849 have laboured with glorious results among the poor Mexicans of <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>, have their provincial house here, and conduct a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> and an apostolic college for the training of youth for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.
