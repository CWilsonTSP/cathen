<p>(<em>Abbreviare</em> = "shorten", "curtail").</p>

<p>Abbreviators are those who make an abridgment or abstract of a long writing or discourse. This is accomplished by contracting the parts, i.e. the words and sentences; an <a href="01021b.htm">abbreviated</a> form of writing common among the Romans. Abbreviations were of two kinds,</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the use of a single letter for a single word,</li><li>the use of a sign, note, or mark for a word or phrase.</li></ul></div>

<p>The <a href="08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> forbade the use of abbreviations in the compilation of the "Digest" and afterwards extended his prohibition to all other writings. This prohibition was not universally <a href="11181c.htm">obeyed</a>. The abbreviators found it to their own convenience and interest to use the abbreviated form, and especially was this the case at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The early <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> practised the abbreviated mode, no doubt as an easy and safe way of communicating with one another and safeguarding their secrets from enemies and <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> brethren.</p>

<h2>Ecclesiastical abbreviators</h2>

<p>In course of time the Apostolic Chancery adopted this mode of writing as the curial style, still further abridging by omitting the diphthongs <em>ae</em> and <em>oe</em>, and likewise all lines and marks of punctuation. The ecclesiastical Abbreviators are officials of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, inasmuch as they are among the principal officials of the Apostolic Chancery, which is one of the oldest and most important offices in the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>. The scope of its labour, as well as the number of its officials, has varied with the times. Up to the twelfth or thirteenth century, the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of the Apostolic, or Roman Chancery was to prepare and expedite the pontifical letters and writs for collation of church dignities and other matters of grave importance which were discussed and decided in <a href="04285a.htm">Consistory</a>. About the thirteenth or fourteenth century, the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, whilst they lived at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, began to reserve the collation of a great many <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, so that all the <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, especially the greater ones, were to be conferred through the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> (Lega, Praelectiones Jur. Can., I, ii, 287). As a consequence, the labour was immensely augmented, and the number of Abbreviators necessarily increased. To regulate the proper expedition of these reserved <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, <a href="08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> instituted the rules of chancery to determine the competency and mode of procedure of the <a href="04798c.htm">Chancery</a>. Afterwards the establishment of the Dataria and the Secretariate of Briefs lightened the work of the Chancery and led to a reduction in the number of Abbreviators.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>According to <a href="03766b.htm">Ciampini</a> (Lib. de Abbreviatorum de parco majore etc., cap. i) the institution of abbreviators was very ancient, succeeding after the <a href="11703a.htm">persecutions</a> to the <a href="11122a.htm">notaries</a> who recorded the acts of the martyrs. Other authors reject this early institution and ascribe it to <a href="08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> (1316). It is certain that he uses the name <em>Abbreviators</em>, but speaks as if they had existed before his time, and had, by overtaxation for their labour, caused much complaint and protest. He (Extravag. Joan. tit. xiii, "Cum ad Sacrosanctae Romanae Ecclesiae") prescribes their work, determines how much they may charge for their labour, fixes a certain tax for an abstract or abridgment of twenty-five words, or their equivalent, 150 letters, forbids them to charge more, even though the abstract goes over twenty-five words but less than fifty words, enacts that the basis of the tax is the labour employed in writing, expediting, etc., the <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, and by no means the emoluments accruing to the recipient of the favour or <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> conferred by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, and declares that whoever shall charge more than the tax fixed by him shall be <a href="14345b.htm">suspended</a> for six months from office, and upon a second violation of the law, shall be deprived of it altogether, and if the delinquent be an abbreviator, he shall be <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Should a large letter have to be rewritten, owing to the inexact copy of the abbreviator, the abbreviator and not the receiver of the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> must pay the extra charge for the extra labour to the apostolic writer.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the date of the institution of the office of abbreviator, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that it became of greater importance and more highly <a href="12436b.htm">privileged</a> upon its erection into a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>. <a href="09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a> (Constit. 3 "In Apostolicae", ii and v) fixed the manner for their examination and <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> and also the tax they should demand for their labour and the punishment for overcharge. He also assigned to them certain emoluments. The Abbreviators of the lower, or lesser, were to be promoted to the higher, or greater, bar or presidency. Their offices were compatible with other offices, i.e. they can hold two <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> or offices at one and the same time, some conferred by the Cardinal Vice-Chancellor, others by the Holy Father.</p>

<h2>Erection of the office into a college of prelates</h2>





<p>In the pontificate of <a href="12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, their number, which had been fixed at twenty-four, had overgrown to such an extent as to diminish considerably the individual remuneration, and, as a consequence, able and competent <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> no longer sought the office, and hence the old style of writing and expediting the <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> was no longer used, to the great injury of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, the interested parties, and the <a href="04794a.htm">dignity</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. To remedy this <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> and to restore the old established chancery style, the Pope selected out of the great number of the then living Abbreviators seventy, and formed them into a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and decreed that their office should be perpetual, that certain emoluments should be attached to it, and granted certain privileges to the possessors of the same. He <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> further that some should be called "Abbreviators of the Upper Bar" (<em>de Parco Majori</em>), the others of the Lower Bar (<em>de Parco Minori</em>); that the former should sit upon a slightly raised portion of the chamber, separated from the rest of the hall or chamber by lattice work, assist the Cardinal Vice-Chancellor, subscribe the letters and have the principal part in examining, revising, and expediting the <a href="01640a.htm">apostolic letters</a> to be issued with the leaden seal; that the latter, however, should sit among the apostolic writers upon benches in the lower part of the chamber, and their <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> was to carry the signed schedules or supplications to the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the upper bar. Then one of the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the upper bar made an abstract, and another <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the same bar revised it. Prelates of the upper bar formed a quasi-tribunal, in which as a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> they decided all <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> that might arise about the form and quality of the letters, of the clauses and <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> to be adjoined to the apostolic letters, and sometimes about the payment of the emoluments and other contingencies. Their opinion about questions concerning chancery business was held in the highest estimation by all the <a href="13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="04447a.htm">tribunals</a>.</p>

<p><a href="11578a.htm">Paul II</a> suppressed this college; but <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> (Constitutio 16, "Divina") reestablished it. He appointed seventy-two abbreviators, of whom twelve were of the upper, or greater, and twenty-two of the lower, or lesser, presidency (<em>Parco</em>), and thirty-eight examiners on first appearance of letters. They were bound to be in attendance on certain days under penalty of fine, and sign letters and diplomas. Ciampini mentions a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Vice-Chancellor by which absentees were mulcted in the loss of their share of the emoluments of the following chancery session. The same Pope also granted many privileges to the College of Abbreviators, but especially to the members of the greater presidency. <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> suppressed many of the <a href="04798c.htm">chancery offices</a>, and so the Tribunal of Correctors and the Abbreviators of the lower presidency disappeared. Of the Tribunal of Correctors, a substitute-corrector alone remains. <a href="02711e.htm">Bouix</a> (Curia Romana, edit. 1859) chronicles the suppression of the lower presidency and puts the number of Abbreviators at that date at eleven. The present college consists of seventeen <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, six substitutes, and one sub-substitute, all of whom, except the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, may be <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> or <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Although the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of Abbreviators was originally to make abstracts and abridgments of the apostolic letters, diplomas, etc., using the legal abbreviations, clauses, and formularies, in course of time, as their office grew in importance they <a href="04696b.htm">delegated</a> that part of their office to their substitute and confined themselves to overseeing the proper expedition of the apostolic letters. Prior to the year 1878, all apostolic letters and briefs requiring for their validity the leaden seal were engrossed upon rough parchment and in Gothic characters (round letters, also called Gallicum and commonly Bollatico, but in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> today Teutonic) without lines, or diphthongs, or marks of punctuation. <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> engrossed on a different parchment, or in different characters with lines and punctuation marks, or without the accustomed abbreviations, clauses, and formularies, would be rejected as spurious. <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> (Constitutio Universae Eccles., 29 Dec., 1878) <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> that they should be written henceforth in ordinary Latin characters upon ordinary parchment, and that no abbreviations should be used except those easily understood.</p>

<h2>Titles and privileges</h2>

<p>Many great privileges were conferred upon Abbreviators in the past. By <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> they were created nobles, Counts Palatine, familiars and members of the papal household, so that they might enjoy all the privileges of domestic <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> and of <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> in actual attendance on the Pope, as regards plurality of <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> as well as expectives. They and their <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> and their <a href="12462a.htm">properties</a> were exempt from all <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> except the immediate <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Pope, and they were not subject to the judgments of the Auditor of Causes, or to the <a href="03341b.htm">Cardinal Vicar</a>. He also empowered them to confer (today within strict limitations) the degree of Doctor, with all university privileges, create notaries (now abrogated), legitimize children so as to make them eligible to receive <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> vacated by their fathers (now revoked), also to ennoble three persons and to make <a href="07477a.htm">Knights</a> of the <a href="13381a.htm">Order of St. Sylvester</a> (<em>Militiae Aureae</em>), the same to enjoy and to wear the insignia of nobility. <a href="07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> rescinded this privilege and reserved to the Pope the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> of creation of such <a href="01695a.htm">knights</a> (Acta Pont. Greg. XVI, Vol. III, 178-179-180). <a href="11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>, who in early manhood was a member of the College (Const. 2, "Romani"), made them Referendaries of Favours, and after three years of service, Referendaries likewise of Justice, enjoying the privileges of Referendaries and permitting one to assist in the signatures before the Pope, giving all a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to a portion in the papal palace and exempting them from the registration of favours as required by <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (Const., 98) with regard to matters pertaining to the Apostolic Chamber. They follow immediately after the twelve voting members of the Signature <em>in capella</em>. Abbreviators of the greater presidency are permitted to wear the purple cassock and <em>cappa</em>, as also <a href="13104a.htm">rochet</a> <em>in capella</em>. Abbreviators of the lower presidency before their suppression were simple <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and according to permission granted by Sixtus IV (loc. cit.) might be even married men. These offices becoming <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> by death of the Abbreviator, no matter where the death take place, are reserved in <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>. The <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> could resign their office in favour of others.</p>

<p>Formerly these offices as well as those of the other <a href="04798c.htm">chancery</a> officers from the Regent down were occasions of venality, which many of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, especially <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, laboured most strenuously to abolish. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (<a href="10602a.htm">Motu Proprio</a>, 4 July, 1898) most solemnly decreed the abolition of all venality in the transfer or Collation of the said offices. As domestic <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the Roman Court, they have personal preeminence in every diocese of the world. They are addressed as "Reverendissimus", "Right Reverend", and "Monsignor". As <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and therefore possessing the <a href="09053a.htm">legal</a> dignity, they are competent to receive and execute papal commands. <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (Const. 3, "Maximo") granted <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the greater presidency the privilege of wearing a hat with purple band, which right they hold even after they have ceased to be abbreviators.</p>
