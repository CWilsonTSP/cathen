<p>(<a href="02258b.htm">Baptized</a> GIACOMO.)</p>

<p><a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and <a href="05692b.htm">exegete</a>; born 20 February, 1469 at <a href="06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; died 9 August, 1534 at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He came of noble stock, and in early boyhood was devout and fond of study. Against the will of his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> he entered the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> before the age of sixteen. As a student of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, Bologna, and Padua he was the wonder of his fellow-students and preceptors. As bachelor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> (19 March, 1492), and afterwards master of students, he began to attract attention by his lectures and writings. Promoted to the chair of <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> at the <a href="11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>, he made a close study of the prevailing <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a> and Philosophism. Besides engaging in controversy with the <a href="13610b.htm">Scotist</a> Trombetta, he took a stand against the <a href="02150c.htm">Averroistic</a> tendencies or teachings of such men as Vernias, Pompanazzi, and Niphus, directing against them his celebrated work, "De Ente et Essenti&acirc;", counted the most subtle and abstruse of his productions. At a general chapter of the order (Ferrara, 1494) Cajetan was selected to conduct the customary defence of theses in presence of the assembled dignitaries. He had to face Pico della Mirandola among others, and such was his success that the students bore him in triumph on their shoulders to receive the felicitations of the master general. He was immediately made master of sacred <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, and for several years expounded the <a href="../summa.html">"Summa"</a> of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, principally at <a href="02760a.htm">Brescia</a> and Pavia, to which latter chair he had been called by the Duke of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Ludovico Sforza. After two years he resigned and repaired to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, whence in 1500 Cardinal Oliviero Caraffa procured his transfer to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1501 he was made <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> general of his order and appointed to the chairs of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> at the Sapienza. On the death of the master general, John Cl&eacute;r&eacute;e, 1507, Cajetan was named <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the order, and the next year he was elected to the generalship. With foresight and ability, he devoted his energies to the promotion of religious discipline, emphasizing the study of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a> as the chief means of attaining the end of the order. His encyclical letters and the acts of chapters <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> during his term of office bear witness to his lofty ideals and to his unceasing efforts to realize them. He was wont to say that he could hardly excuse from grevious <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> a brother <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> who failed to devote at least four hours a day to study. "Let others rejoice in their prerogatives", he once wrote, "but the work of our Order is at an end unless sacred <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> be our commendation." He was himself a model of diligence, and it was said of him that he could quote almost the entire "Summa" from memory. About the fourth year of his generalship, Cajetan rendered important service to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by appearing before the Pseudo-Council of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (1511), where he denounced the disobedience of the participating <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and overwhelmed them with his arguments. This was the occasion of his defence of the power and monarchical supremacy of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. It is chiefly to his endeavors that is ascribed the failure of this <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> movement, abetted by Louis XII of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. He was one of the first to counsel <a href="08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> to convoke a real <a href="04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a>, i.e. the Fifth Lateran. In this council Cajetan was deputed by the principal <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders to defend their common interests. Under the same pontiff he was instrumental in granting to Ferdinand of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> the first <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missionaries who devoted organized effort to the conversion of the natives of America.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On 1 July, 1517, Cajetan was created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a>. He was also appointed <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, but opposition on the part of the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> senate prevented his taking possession and he resigned 8 February, 1518. On taking the demand of <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, however, he was later made <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, but this was after he had been sent in 1518 as <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a> to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, bringing the insignia of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> to <a href="01262a.htm">Albert of Brandenburg</a>, and a sword blessed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to Emperor Maximilian. On this occasion he was empowered to confer with the latter and with the King of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> on the terms of an alliance against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. He also represented the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at the Diet of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> (1519), and took an active part in the election of <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a> (1519), thereby winning that emperor's friendship and gratitude. While executing these missions, the more serious <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of meeting <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, then started on his career of rebellion, was assigned to him. Cajetan's <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> learning and humane disposition seemed to fit him for the task of successfully treating with the proud and obstinate <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have admitted that in all his relations with the latter Cajetan exhibited a spirit of moderation, that did <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> to his lofty character. But neither pleading, learning, nor conciliatory words availed to secure the desired submission. <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> parleyed and temporized as he had done with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> itself, and finally showed the insincerity of his earlier protestations by spurning the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and his representative alike. Some have blamed Cajetan for his failure to avert <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> defection, but others like Hefele and <a href="07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> exonerate him. In 1523 he was sent by <a href="01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to King Louis of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> to encourage the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> in their resistance to the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Recalled the following year by <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, he became one of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> chief advisors. During the sack of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the imperialist army (1527) Cajetan, like other principal <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, was seized, and obtained the release of himself and household only on payment of five thousand Roman crowns of gold, a sum which he had to borrow and which he later made up by strictest economy in the affairs of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was one of the nineteen <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who, in a solemn consistory held by <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> (23 March, 1534), pronounced definitively for the validity of the marriage of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> and Catherine of Aragon. This was about the last public act of his life, for he died the same year and was buried, as he requested, in an <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> in the <a href="15387a.htm">vestibule</a> of the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. It was the common opinion of his contemporaries that had he lived, he would have succeeded <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> on the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. Much interest attaches to a portrait of Cajetan, the only one known, recently discovered by P&egrave;re Berthier, O.P. in a collection of notables of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, owned by <a href="08698b.htm">Count Krasinski</a> of <a href="15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> (see bibliography).</p>

<p>Cajetan has been described as small in bodily stature but gigantic in <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>. In all his varied and laborious offices he never omitted his daily study and writing, nor failed in the practices of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He faced the trying issues of his times calmly and fearlessly, and endeavored by learning, tact, and charity to pacify hostile minds, to lead back the <a href="05525a.htm">erring</a>, to stem the tide of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and to prevent <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. His written solutions of living moral problems cover a wide field. His circumstances and position often required him to take part in polemical discussions, yet he is said never to have given personal offence in his writings. His style, purely scientific and unrhetorical, is the more noteworthy for having attained its directness and simplicity in the golden age of <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a>. More than any other <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of his epoch, he ministered to actual <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> needs of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. With penetration and sagacity he ranged beyond the confines of contemporary thought, and in his tentative solutions of grave problems, still open and unsettled, displayed judgment and frankness. It is not strange that he developed tendencies which surprised the more conservative, and essayed opinions which in some instances were, and have remained, unusual and occasionally <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. He found numerous critics, even in his own order, who were as censorious of him as his friends were <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> in upholding his merits. Among his opponents, the learned <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Bartholomew Spina (died 1542) was conspicuous. His persistent antagonism began, strangely enough, after he had written a laudatory preface to Cajetan's commentary on the "Secunda Secundae" (second section of the second part of the <a href="../summa.html">"Summa"</a>) of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, whose publication he supervised for the author in 1517. The next year, in his refutation of Pompanazzi, Spina appears to have considered Cajetan as falling party within the scope of his strictures because of certain alleged concessions to the prevalent <a href="02150c.htm">Averroistic</a> <a href="12652a.htm">rationalism</a> in a commentary on the "De Anim&acirc;" of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. Cajetan held that <a href="02150c.htm">Averroes</a> had correctly exhibited the <a href="01713a.htm">Stagirite</a> as a believer in monopsychism, or the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the unity of one <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> for humanity and the mortality of individual <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. Whilst working for, and concurring in the council's condemnation of this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in 1513, Cajetan had not favoured the requirement that in their public lectures professors of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> should bring up no teachings in conflict of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> without refuting them; this, he contended, was the proper office of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Elsewhere Cajetan had also intimated that reason left to itself could not adequately and conclusively demonstrate the <a href="14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>. From these beginnings, Spina, who during his later years was <a href="10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a>, relentlessly pursued Cajetan living and dead. On these slender grounds some writers, including Renan (Averro&eacute;s et l'Averro&icirc;sme, Paris, 1867, 351) and Botta (Ueberweg, History of Philosophy, tr. Morris, New York, 1903, II, Appendix II), have misrepresented Cajetan as "boldly asserting the eternity of the universe and the destruction of personality at death", and have classed him with the very men against whom he wrote, as an initiator of a new period in the development of anti-Scholastic philosophy.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> Cajetan is justly ranked as one of the foremost defenders and exponents of the <a href="14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. His commentaries on the "Summa Theologica", the first in that extensive field, begun in 1507 and finished in 1522, are his greatest work and were speedily recognized as a classic in <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> literature. The work is primarily a defence of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> against the attacks of <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a>. In the third part it reviews the aberrations of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, especially <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>. The important relation between Cajetan and the <a href="14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a> was emphasized by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, when by his Pontifical Letters of 15 October, 1879, he ordered the former's commentaries and those of Ferrariensis to be incorporated with the text of the "Summa" in the official Leonine edition of the complete works of St. Thomas, the first volume of which appeared at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1882. This edition has restored a number of passages which <a href="12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> desired to have expunged from the texts, the publication of which he ordered in 1570. The suppressed parts, now for the most part inoffensive, were largely in the nature of personal views and had no direct bearing on <a href="14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as a system. In his <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> work, begun in 1523 and continued to the time of his death, Cajetan sought to counteract the Biblical extravagances of the Humanists and to defeat the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran movement</a> on the ground from which it had chosen to reject the authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and of tradition. Chiefly with rabbinical assistance, it is said, being himself unversed in Hebrew, and with the aid of current Greek versions he prepared a literal translation of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, including the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as far as the end of the third chapter of Isaias, and all the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> except the Apocalypse, which on account of its difficulties he was unwilling to undertake. It was his object, he declared in a dedicatory letter to <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> published in his edition of the Gospels, to ascertain the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> literal sense of the Scriptures, and he did not hesitate to adopt new renderings, provided they did not conflict with the Sacred Word and with the teachings of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This position, much criticized in his time, is now quite in line with the common method of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05692b.htm">exegetics</a>. Though closely following <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> on the authenticity of the Biblical texts and utilizing the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> version and notes of <a href="05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, with whom he was on friendly terms, he produced a work whose importance was not overlooked, but whose freedom and wide departure from the Fathers and the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> created distrust and alarm. In his critical interpretation, for instance, he ventured an allegorical explanation of the first chapters of Genesis, and he seemed more than three centuries in advance of his day in questioning the authenticity of the last chapter of St. Mark, the authorship of several epistles, viz., Hebrews, James, II Peter, II and III John, Jude, the genuineness of the passage of the three witnesses of (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#vrs7">1 John 5:7</a>), etc. In this field also he was bitterly assailed, especially by Ambrose Catharinus, an extraordinary but erratic genius, who had abandoned the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> to enter the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, and had become a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Cajetan's accompanying <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> observations, however, are important, and many scholars have profitably studied them in conjunction with his commentaries on the "Summa".</p>

<p>It has been significantly said of Cajetan that his positive teaching was regarded as a guide for others and his silence as an implicit censure. His rectitude, candour, and moderation were praised even by his enemies. Always obedient, and submitting his works to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, he presented a striking contrast to the leaders of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and revolt, whom he strove to save from their folly. To <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> he was the "lamp of the Church", and everywhere in his career, as the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> light of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he was heard with respect and pleasure by <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, nobility, and people. The works of Cajetan aggregate about 115 titles. The commentaries on the several parts of the "Summa" exist in many editions. Of complete editions, sometimes including the text of the "Summa" and sometimes without it, the following are noteworthy: 10 vols. fol., Lyons, 1540; edition of <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> in complete works of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, Rome, 1570; 7 vols. 8vo with commentaries of Javelli and Caponi, <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1596; 10 vols. fol., Rome, 1773; Leonine edition of St. Thomas (Summa) <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1888.
