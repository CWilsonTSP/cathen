<p>To genuflect [<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>genu flectere</em>, <em>geniculare</em> (post-classic), to bend the knee; Greek <em>gonu klinein</em> or <em>kamptein</em>] expresses:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>an attitude</li><li>a gesture: involving, like prostration, a profession of dependence or helplessness, and therefore very naturally adopted for <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> and for worship in general.</li></ul></div>

<p>"The knee is made flexible by which the offence of the Lord is mitigated, wrath appeased, grace called forth" (<a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, Hexaem., VI, ix). "By such posture of the body we show forth our humbleness of heart" (<a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, De <a href="11476a.htm">Parasceve</a>). "The bending of the knee is an expression of penitence and sorrow for <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> committed" (Rabanus Maurus, De Instit. Cler., II, xli).</p>

<h2 id="section1">An attitude or posture at prayer</h2>

<p>To kneel while <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> is now usual among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Under the <a href="10582c.htm">Old Law</a> the practice was otherwise. In the Jewish Church it was the rule to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> standing, except in time of mourning (Scudamore, Notit. Eucharist., 182). Of Anna, the mother of Samuel we read that she said to Heli: "I am that <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> who stood before thee here <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> to the Lord" (<a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#vrs26">1 Samuel 1:26</a>; see also <a href="../bible/neh009.htm#vrs3">Nehemiah 9:3-5</a>). Of both the <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> and the <a href="12553d.htm">publican</a> it is stated in the <a href="11460a.htm">parable</a> that they stood to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a>, the attitude being emphasized in the case of the former (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#vrs11">Luke 18:11, 13</a>). Christ assumes that standing would be the ordinary posture in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> of those whom He addressed:" And when you shall stand to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a>", etc. (<a href="../bible/mar011.htm#vrs25">Mark 11:25</a>). "And when ye pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, that love to stand and <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> in the synagogues", etc. (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs5">Matthew 6:5</a>). But when the occasion was one of special solemnity, or the petition very urgent, or the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> made with exceptional fervour, the Jewish suppliant knelt. Besides the many pictorial representations of kneeling <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, and the like, left us by ancient art, <a href="../bible/gen041.htm#vrs43">Genesis 41:43</a> and Esth., iii, 2 may be quoted to show how universally in the East kneeling was accepted as the proper attitude of suppliants and dependents. Thus Solomon dedicating his temple "kneeling down in the presence of all the multitude of Israel, and lifting up his hands towards Heaven", etc. (<a href="../bible/2ch006.htm#vrs13">2 Chronicles 6:13</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#vrs54">1 Kings 8:54</a>). Esdras too: "I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to the <a href="06608a.htm">Lord my God</a>" (<a href="../bible/ezr009.htm#vrs5">Ezra 9:5</a>); and Daniel: "opening the windows in his upper chamber towards <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, he knelt down three times a day, and adored, and gave thanks before his <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, as he had been accustomed to do before" (<a href="../bible/dan006.htm#vrs10">Daniel 6:10</a>), illustrate this practice. Of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> great <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> for His disciples and for His <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> we are only told that "lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said", etc. (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#vrs1">John 17:1</a>); but of His <a href="01224a.htm">Agony in the Garden of Gethsemani</a>: "kneeling down, he <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs41">Luke 22:41</a>). The <a href="09182a.htm">lepers</a>, beseeching the Saviour to have mercy on them, kneel (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs40">Mark 1:40</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/mar010.htm#vrs17">10:17</a>).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Coming to the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, of St. Stephen we read: "And falling on his knees, he cried with a loud voice, saying", etc. (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs59">Acts 7:59</a>); of the Prince of the Apostles: "Peter kneeling down <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a>" (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs40">Acts 9:40</a>); of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>: "kneeling down, he <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> with them all" (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs36">Acts 20:36</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs5">21:5</a>). It would seem that the kneeling posture for <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> speedily became habitual among the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Of St. James, the brother of the Lord, tradition relates that from his continual kneeling his knees had become callous as those of a camel (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250102.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.23</a>; Brev. Rom., 1 May). For <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> the expressions "to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a>" and "to bow the knee" to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> are complementary (cf. <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs10">Philippians 2:10</a>; <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#vrs14">Ephesians 3:14</a>, etc.). <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0305.htm"><em>To Scapula</em> 4</a>) treats kneeling and <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> as practically synonymous. And when forgiveness of offences has to be besought, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (De Orat., 31) goes so far as to maintain that a kneeling posture is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the "orantes" (<a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> figures) of early <a href="03710a.htm">Christian art</a> are in the <a href="03417b.htm">catacomb</a> frescoes invariably depicted as standing with arms extended. Some remarks of Leclercq (Manuel d'Arch&eacute;ologie chr&eacute;tienne, I, 153 sqq.) suggest that a probable explanation may be found in the view that these "orantes" are merely conventional representations of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and of suppliants in the abstract. They are symbols, not pictures of the actual. Now, conventional representations are inspired as a rule in respect of detail, not so much by manners and customs prevalent at the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of their execution, as by an ideal conserved by tradition and at the place and time accepted as fitting. Ancient art has left us examples of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> as well as of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> "orantes". The attitude (standing with arms extended or upraised) is substantially the same in all. This, then, is the attitude symbolical, among the ancients, of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>In reality, however, suppliants have, as a matter of course, very generally knelt. Hence such classical phrases as: "Genu ponere alicui" (Curtius); "Inflexo genu adorare" (Seneca); "Nixi genibus" (Livy); "Genibus minor" (Horace). On the other hand, examples are not wanting of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> who <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> standing. The "Stans in medio carceris, expansis manibus orabat", which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has adopted as her memory of the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="01203c.htm">St. Agatha</a>, is an illustration. And as late as the end of the sixth century, <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> describes St. Benedict as uttering his dying <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> "stans, erectis in coelum manibus" (Dial., II, c. xxxvii). Nor is it unlikely that since standing has always been a posture recognized, and even enjoined, in public and <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, it may have survived well into the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> as one suitable, at least in some circumstances, for even private devotion. Yet, from the fourth century onwards, to kneel has certainly been the rule for private <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (Vita Constant., IV, xxii) declares kneeling to have been the customary posture of the <a href="04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> when at his devotions in his oratory. At the end of the century, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> tells us: "They who <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> do with the members of their body that which befits suppliants; they fix their knees, stretch forth their hands, or even prostrate themselves on the ground" (De cur&acirc; pro mortuis, v). Even for the ante-Nicene period, the conclusion arrived at by Warren is probably substantially correct: &mdash;"The recognized attitude for <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, liturgically speaking, was standing, but kneeling was early introduced for penitential and perhaps ordinary <a href="06043a.htm">ferial</a> seasons, and was frequently, though not necessarily, adopted in private <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>" (Liturgy of the ante-Nicene Church, 145)</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that, early in the sixth century, St. Benedict (Reg., c. l) enjoins upon his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> that when absent from choir, and therefore compelled to recite the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> as a private <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, they should not stand as when in choir, but kneel throughout. That, in our time, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> accepts kneeling as the more fitting attitude for private <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> is evinced by such rules as the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> <a href="13216a.htm">rubric</a> directing that, save for a momentary rising while the Gospel is being read, all present kneel from the beginning to the end of a low <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>; and by the recent decrees requiring that the celebrant recite kneeling the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> (though they include collects which, liturgically, postulate a standing posture) prescribed by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> to be said after Mass it is well, however, to bear in mind that there is no real <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to kneel during private <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Thus, unless conditioned on that particular posture being taken, the <a href="07783a.htm">indulgence</a> attached to a <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> is gained, whether, while reciting it, one kneel or not (S. Cong. of the Index, 18 Sept., 1862, n. 398). The "Sacrosanct&aelig;", recited by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> after saying the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, is one of the exceptions. It must be said kneeling, except when illness makes the doing so physically impossible. Turning now to the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, it is very evident that standing, not kneeling, is the correct posture for those taking part in it. A glance at the attitude of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> officiating at Mass or <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, or using the <a href="13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, will be sufficient <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a>. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in attendance also, and even the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> assisting, are, by the <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, assumed to be standing. The Canon of the Mass designates them as "circumstantes". The practice of kneeling during the Consecration was introduced during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and is in relation with the <a href="05380b.htm">Elevation</a> which originated in the same period. The <a href="13216a.htm">rubric</a> directing that while the celebrant and his <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> recite the Psalm "Judica", and make the Confession, those present who are not <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> should kneel, is a mere reminiscence of the fact that these introductory devotions were originally private <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of preparation, and therefore outside the liturgy properly so called. It must not, in this connexion escape attention that, in proportion as the faithful have ceased to follow the liturgy, replacing its formul&aelig; by <a href="12275b.htm">private devotions</a>, the standing attitude has fallen more and more into disuse among them. In our own time it is quite usual for the congregation at a high Mass to stand for the Gospel and Creed; and, at all other times either to remain seated (when this is permitted) or to kneel. There are, nevertheless, certain <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> to kneel during which is <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, the reason being that kneeling is the posture especially appropriate to the supplications of penitents, and is a characteristic attitude of <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> entreaty in general. Hence, <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a> are chanted, kneeling, unless (which in ancient times was deemed even more fitting) they can be gone through by a procession of mourners. So, too, public penitents knelt during such portions of the liturgy as they were allowed to assist at. The modern practice of Solemn Exposition of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> for public adoration has naturally led to more frequent and more continuous kneeling in church than formerly. Thus, at a Benediction service it is <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> to kneel from beginning to end of the function, except during the chant of the <a href="14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> and like <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> of Praise.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that penitents knelt during public <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the rest of the faithful standing. A corollary easily drawn from this was that in <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> and other penitential seasons, when all <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> without distinction professed themselves to be "penitents", the whole congregation should kneel during the celebration of the Divine Mysteries and during other <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>. This has given occasion to the <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> <a href="13216a.htm">rubric</a>, requiring the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and by implication the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, to kneel in <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>, on vigils, ember-days, etc., while the celebrant recites the collects and post-communions of the Mass, and during the whole of the Canon, that is, from the Sanctus to the Agnus Dei. In early times an attempt was made to insist yet more emphatically on the character of penitents as that most befitting ordinary <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. A practice crept in of posing in church as penitents, that is, of kneeling, on all days alike. It was a principle akin to that which deemed it a great virtue to fast even on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days. In both cases the exaggeration was condemned and severely repressed. In the twentieth canon of the <a href="11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 325) the fathers lay down (the canon, though passed over by Rufinus, is undoubtedly genuine): &mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Because there are some who kneel on the <a href="14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a> and in the days of Pentecost [the fifty days between <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Whit-Sunday]: that all things may be uniformly performed in every <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> or diocese, it seems good to the Holy Synod that the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> [<em>tas euchas</em>] be by all made to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, standing. </p></blockquote>

<p>The canon thus forbids kneeling on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>; but (and this is carefully to be noted) does not enjoin kneeling on other days. The distinction indicated of days and seasons is very probably of Apostolic origin. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, long before Nic&aelig;a, had declared kneeling on the <a href="14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a> to be <em>nefas</em> (De Cor. Mil., c. iii). See also pseudo-Justin (Qu&aelig;st. et Resp. ad Orthodox., Q. 115); <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02107.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VII</a>); <a href="11771a.htm">Peter of Alexandria</a> (can. xv); with others. For post-Nicene times, see St. Hilary (Prolog. in Psalm.); <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Dial. contra Lucif., c. iv); <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (Expos. Fidei, 22 and 24); <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (<a href="../fathers/3203.htm"><em>On the Holy Spirit</em> 27</a>); St. Maximus (Hom. iii, De Pentec.); etc. Note, however, with Hefele (Councils, II, ii, sect. 42) that <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is expressly stated to have <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> kneeling, during <a href="11516a.htm">paschal time</a> (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs36">Acts 20:36</a>; <a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs5">21:5</a>). Moreover <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, more than fifty years after the <a href="11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>, writes: "Ut autem stantes in illis diebus et omnibus dominicis oremus utrum ubique servetur nescio" (i.e. but I do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> whether there is still observed everywhere the custom of standing, whilst <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a>, on those days and on all <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>). Ep. cxix ad Januar. By canon law (II Decretal., bk., IX, ch. ii) the prohibition to kneel is extended to all principal festivals, but it is limited to public <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, "nisi aliquis ex devotione illud facere velit in secreto", i.e. (unless anyone, from devotion, should wish to do that in private). In any case, to have the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to stand during public <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> was looked upon as a sort of privilege &mdash; an "immunitas" (<a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, loc. cit.).</p>

<p>On the other hand, to be degraded into the class of the "genuflectentes", or "prostrati", who (Fourth <a href="01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, can. lxxxii) were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to kneel during public services even on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and in <a href="11516a.htm">paschal time</a>, was deemed a severe punishment. St. Basil calls kneeling the lesser penance (<em>metanoia mikra</em>) as opposed to prostration, the greater penance (<em>metanoia megale</em>). Standing, on the contrary, was the attitude of praise and thanksgiving. <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (loc. cit.) considers it to signify <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a>, and therefore to be the fitting posture for the weekly commemoration by <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the <a href="12789a.htm">Lord's Resurrection</a>, on the <a href="14335a.htm">first day of the week</a> (See also Cassian, Cobb., XXI). Hence, on all days alike, the faithful stood during the chant of psalms, <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and canticles, and more particularly during the solemn Eucharistic or Thanksgiving <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (our Preface) preliminary to the Consecration in the Divine Mysteries. The diaconal invitation (<em>Stomen kalos, k.t.l.; orthoi</em>; <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a>. <em>Urthi</em>; Armen. <em>Orthi</em>) is frequent at this point of the liturgy. Nor have we any grounds for <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a>, against the tradition of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, that during the Canon of the Mass the faithful knelt on weekdays, and stood only on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and in <a href="11516a.htm">paschal time</a>. It is far more likely that the kneeling was limited to <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> and other seasons of penance. What precisely were the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> which the Fathers of Nic&aelig;a had in view when insisting on the distinction of days is not at once evident. In our time the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> is observed to the letter in regard to the <a href="13409a.htm">Salve Regina</a> or other antiphon to <a href="15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> with which the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> is concluded, and also in the recitation of the Angelus. But both these devotions are of comparatively recent origin. The term <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (<em>euche</em>) used at Nic&aelig;a, has in this connection always been taken in its strict signification as meaning supplication (Probst, Drei ersten Jahrhund., I, art. 2, ch. xlix). The diaconal <a href="09286a.htm">litany</a>, general in the East, in which all conditions of men are <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, preparatory to the offering of the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, comes under this head. And in fact in the Clementine Liturgy (Brightman, 9; Funk, Didascalia, 489) there is a <a href="13216a.htm">rubric</a> enjoining that the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, before beginning the <a href="09286a.htm">litany</a>, invite all to kneel down, and terminate by bidding all to rise up again. It remains however unexplained why the exception for <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and <a href="11516a.htm">paschal time</a> is not expressly recalled. In the Western or <a href="13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, traces of a distinction of days still exist. For instance at the end of the <a href="04187a.htm">Complin</a> of <a href="07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> there is the <a href="13216a.htm">rubric</a>: "Et non flectuntur genua toto tempore Paschali", which is the Nicene rule to the letter. The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> has likewise (though lightly varied in wording) been incorporated into the canon law of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (Dist. iii, De consecrat., c. x). It may be added that, both in the East and in the West, certain extensions of the exemption from the penitential practice of kneeling appear to have been gradually insisted upon. "The 29th Arabic Canon of Nic&aelig;a extends the rule of not kneeling, but only bending forward, to all great festivals of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>" (Bright, Canons of Nic&aelig;a, 86). Consult <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, xiv, 89, for a similar modification made by the Third Council of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 813. See also the c. Quoniam (II Decretal., bk. 9, c. 2) cited above.</p>

<p>To fix with some precision the import of the Nicene canon, as it was understood and reduced to practice by the ancients, the supplications, to which the name "bidding <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>" has sometimes been given, merit careful notice. They are the Western analogues of the Eastern diaconal <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a>, and recur with great frequency in the old Gallican and Mozarabic uses. In their full form they seem peculiar to the <a href="13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. The officiating <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> invites the faithful present, who are supposed to be standing, to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> for some intention which he specifies. Thereupon, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> in attendance subjoins: "Flectamus genua" (Let us kneel down). He is obeyed. Anciently a pause more or less long, spent by each one in private and silent <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, ensued. This ended at a sign given by the celebrant, or for him by some inferior minister, who, turning to the people with the word "levate", bade them stand up again. They having done so, the celebrant summed up, as it were, or collected their silent petitions in a short <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, hence called a collect. "Cum is qui orationem collecturus est e terra surrexerit, omnes pariter surgunt" (Cassian, Instit., II, vii). The stress put in the early Church upon the due performance of this ceremonial explains why, before receiving <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, a <a href="03430b.htm">catechumen</a> was required to rehearse it publicly. He is standing before the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> who addresses him: "Ora, electe, fiecte genua, et dic Pater noster". This is the "Oremus, flectamus genua" of the liturgy. The direction to say the <a href="09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> in preference to any other, or at least previously to any other, is very natural. A glance at the Roman <a href="09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> will show what other <em>preces</em> were usually added &mdash; <a href="08714a.htm">Kyrie eleison</a> (repeated several times) and certain Psalm verses concluding, as a rule, with "Domine exaudi orationem meam. Et clamor meus ad te veniat" (<a href="../bible/psa101.htm#vrs1">Psalm 101:1</a>). Then the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumen</a> is told: "Leva, comple orationem tuam, et dic <a href="01407b.htm">Amen</a>". The words of the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> in which the officiating <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> will collect his supplications and those of the rest of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> are omitted, as it is only the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumen's</a> part in the common <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> which is being dealt with. The <a href="03430b.htm">catechumen</a> rises and says "Amen". This is gone through three times and the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumen</a> having shown that he has learned how to comport himself during the "oratio fidelium" of the liturgy in which he will henceforth take part, the <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is proceeded with (See <a href="13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, De Baptismo Adultorum; and Van der Stappen, IV, Q. cxvii).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Of silent kneeling <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> the characteristic example is the group of <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> for all conditions of men in our <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> liturgy. They have retained the name "Orationes solemnes" (usual <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>) because, in primitive ages, gone through in every public Mass. They are the Latin "Oratio Fidelium", and their place in the daily liturgy is still marked by the "Oremus" invitation at the <a href="11217a.htm">Offertory</a> (Duchesne, Origines du culte chr&eacute;tien, ch. vi, art. 5). The same form of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> obtains at ordinations and in some few other rites. But it has long since been shorn of its most striking feature. The faithful are indeed bidden to kneel down; but straightway follows the order to stand up again, the impressive pause being suppressed. Again, nowadays, the object of the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> is mostly no longer announced. The single word "Oremus' uttered by the celebrant is followed immediately by "Flectamus genua", with its momentary genuflexion, "Levate", and the collect (see, in the Roman <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the ember-day Masses, etc.). The learned Bishop Van der Stappen (Sacra Liturg., II, Q. lxv) is of opinion that anciently on all days alike, there was a pause for silent <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> after every "Oremus" introducing a collect; and that on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and other non-penitential days this same silent <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> was made by all standing and with hands raised to <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. The invitation <em>Flectamus genua</em> merely reminded the faithful that the day was one of those on which, by the custom of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, they had to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> kneeling. The <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a> for the Pentecost ember-days which occur in <a href="11516a.htm">paschal time</a>, and that prefixed to the last collect in the blessing of candles on the feast of the Purification, strengthen this view. Another instance of kneeling <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (probably replaced by one said standing, on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and in <a href="11516a.htm">paschal time</a>) is that of the benedictions or short collects which, in early ages, it was usual to add after the recitation of each psalm, in public, and often in private, worship. The short <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> called "absolutions" in the Office of <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a> are a survival of this discipline. (For a complete set of these <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> see Mozarabic <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a> in P.L., LXXXV. These collects were said kneeling, or at least were preceded by a brief <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> gone through in that attitude. They are probably the "genuflectiones", the multiplicity of which in the daily life of some of the earlier <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> astonishes us (see for instance the Life of <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> in the <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, 17 March). The kneeling posture is that at present enjoined for the receiving of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, or at least confirmation, <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, penance and <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. Certain exceptions, however, seem to show that this was not always the case. Thus, the <a href="12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>, when solemnly celebrating, receives <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> in both kinds, seated; and, remaining seated, administers it to his <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> who are standing. In like manner, should a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> who is only a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> be elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; he is <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> (if he has not yet taken the step) and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, while sitting on his faldstool before the altar. It seems reasonable to suppose that at the <a href="14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> the Apostles were seated round the table when Christ gave them His sacred Body and Blood. That, in the early Church, the faithful stood when receiving into their hands the <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> particle can hardly be questioned. <a href="02645b.htm">Cardinal Bona</a> indeed (Rer. Liturg., H, xvii, 8) hesitates somewhat as to Roman usage; but declares that in regard to the East there can be no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> whatever. He inclines moreover to the view that at the outset the same practice obtained in the West (cf. Bingham, XVI, v). <a href="05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, writing to one of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> of his time, speaks emphatically of "one who has stood by the table and has extended his hand to receive the Holy Food" (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.9</a>). The custom of placing the Sacred Particle in the mouth, rather than in the hand of the communicant, dates in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the sixth, and in Gaul from the ninth century (Van der Stappen, IV, 227; cf. <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, Dial., I, III, c. iii). The change of attitude in the communicant may perhaps have come about nearly simultaneously with this. Greater reverence was being insisted upon; and if it be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that in some places each communicant mounted the altar-steps, and took for himself a portion of the <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Eucharist (Clem. Alex., <a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.1</a>) some reform was sorely needed.</p>

<h2 id="section2">A gesture of reverence</h2>

<p>This is peculiar to the <a href="13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, and consists in the momentary bending of one or both knees so as to touch the earth. Genuflecting, understood in this sense, has now almost everywhere in the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a> been substituted for the profound bowing down of head and body that formerly obtained, and that is still maintained in the East as the supreme act of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> reverence. It is laid down by modern authorities that a genuflexion includes every sort of inclination, so that any bowing while kneeling is, as a rule, superfluous (Martinucci, Man. Sacr. C&aelig;rem., I, i, nn. 5 and 6). There are certain exceptions, however, to this rule, in the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <em>cultus</em> of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. The practice of genuflecting has no claim to antiquity of origin. It appears to have been introduced and gradually to have spread in the West during the later <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and scarcely to have been generally looked upon as <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> before the end of the fifteenth century. The older Roman Missals make no mention of it. Father Thurston gives <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 1502 as the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the formal and semi-official recognition of these genuflexions. Even after it became usual to raise the <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Host and Chalice for the adoration of the Faithful after the Consecration, it was long before the <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> preceding and following genuflexions were insisted upon (see Thurston in "The Month", Oct., 1897). The genuflexions now indicated at such words as "Et incarnatus est", "Et Verbum caro factum est", and the like, are likewise of comparatively recent introduction, though in some cases they replace a prostration that was usual, in ancient times, when the same sacred words were solemnly uttered (see, for instance, in regard to the "Et incarnatus", the curious passage in the work of Radulphus Tongrensis (De can. observ.). The <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> custom of bending the knee, yet so as not to touch the ground, is curious; and has interest from the historical point of view as testifying to the reluctance formerly felt by many to the modern practice of genuflecting. See also the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the S. Cong. of Rites (n. 3402) of 7 July, 1876, insisting that <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> as well as men must genuflect before the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. The simple bending of the knee, unlike prostration, cannot be traced to sources outside <a href="15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>. Thus, the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and classical gesture of adoration consisted in the standing before the being or thing to be worshipped, in putting the right hand to the mouth (<em>ad ora</em>), and in turning the body to the right. The act of falling down, or prostration, was introduced in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the C&aelig;sars brought from the East the Oriental custom of worshipping the emperors in this manner as gods. "Caium C&aelig;sarem adorari ut deum constituit cum reversus ex Syria non aliter adire ausus esset quam capite velato circumvertensque se, deinde procumbens" (Suet., Vit., ii). The <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rules for genuflecting are now very definite.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>All genuflect (bending both knees) when adoring the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> unveiled, as at Expositions.</li><li>All genuflect (bending the right knee only) when doing reverence to the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, enclosed in the Tabernacle, or lying upon the corporal during the Mass. Mass-servers are not to genuflect, save when the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is at the altar where Mass is being said (cf. Wapelhorst, <em>infra</em>). The same <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> is paid to a <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="04529a.htm">True Cross</a> when exposed for public veneration.</li><li>The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions genuflect on one knee to the cross over the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a>, and likewise in passing before the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> when he presides at a <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. From these genuflexions, however, an officiating <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, as also all <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, canons, etc., are dispensed, bowing of the head and shoulders being substituted for the genuflexion.</li><li>On <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, after the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the Adoration of the Cross, and until <a href="07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, all, <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> alike, genuflect in passing before the unveiled cross upon the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a>. </li></ol></div>
