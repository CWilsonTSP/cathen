<h2 id="i">New Testament accounts</h2>

<p>John was the son of Zebedee and <a href="13403a.htm">Salome</a>, and the brother of <a href="08279b.htm">James the Greater.</a> In the Gospels the two brothers are often called after their father "the sons of Zebedee" and received from <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> the honourable title of <em>Boanerges</em>, i.e. "sons of thunder" (<a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs17">Mark 3:17</a>). Originally they were fishermen and fished with their father in the <a href="14716b.htm">Lake of Genesareth</a>. According to the usual and entirely probable explanation they became, however, for a time disciples of <a href="08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, and were called by Christ from the circle of John's followers, together with <a href="11744a.htm">Peter</a> and Andrew, to become His disciples (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs35">John 1:35-42</a>). The first disciples returned with their new Master from the <a href="08501a.htm">Jordan</a> to <a href="06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and apparently both John and the others remained for some time with <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (cf. John ii, 12, 22; iv, 2, 8, 27 sqq.). Yet after the second return from <a href="08544a.htm">Judea</a>, John and his companions went back again to their trade of fishing until he and they were called by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> to definitive <a href="05029a.htm">discipleship</a> (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs18">Matthew 4:18-22</a>; <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs16">Mark 1:16-20</a>). In the lists of the Apostles John has the second place (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>), the third (<a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs17">Mark 3:17</a>), and the fourth (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs3">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs14">Luke 6:14</a>), yet always after James with the exception of a few passages (<a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs51">Luke 8:51</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs28">9:28</a> in the Greek text; <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs13">Acts 1:13</a>).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From James being thus placed first, the conclusion is drawn that John was the younger of the two brothers. In any case John had a prominent position in the Apostolic body. Peter, James, and he were the only witnesses of the raising of Jairus's daughter (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm#vrs37">Mark 5:37</a>), of the Transfiguration (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs1">Matthew 17:1</a>), and of the <a href="01224a.htm">Agony in Gethsemani</a> (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs37">Matthew 26:37</a>). Only he and Peter were sent into the city to make the preparation for the <a href="14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs8">Luke 22:8</a>). At the Supper itself his place was next to Christ on Whose breast he leaned (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs23">John 13:23, 25</a>). According to the general interpretation John was also that "other disciple" who with Peter followed Christ after the arrest into the palace of the <a href="12407b.htm">high-priest</a> (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs15">John 18:15</a>). John alone remained near his beloved Master at the foot of the Cross on Calvary with the Mother of Jesus and the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, and took the desolate Mother into his care as the last legacy of Christ (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs25">John 19:25-27</a>). After the <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> John with Peter was the first of the disciples to hasten to the grave and he was the first to believe that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> had truly risen (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs2">John 20:2-10</a>). When later Christ appeared at the <a href="14716b.htm">Lake of Genesareth</a> John was also the first of the seven disciples present who recognized his Master standing on the shore (<a href="../bible/joh021.htm#vrs7">John 21:7</a>). The Fourth <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> has shown us most clearly how close the relationship was in which he always stood to his Lord and Master by the title with which he is accustomed to indicate himself without giving his name: "the disciple whom <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a>". After <a href="01767a.htm">Christ's Ascension</a> and the Descent of the Holy Spirit, John took, together with Peter, a prominent part in the founding and guidance of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. We see him in the company of Peter at the healing of the lame man in the Temple (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs1">Acts 3:1 sqq.</a>). With Peter he is also thrown into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs3">Acts 4:3</a>). Again, we find him with the prince of the Apostles visiting the newly converted in Samaria (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs14">Acts 8:14</a>).</p>

<p>We have no positive information concerning the duration of this activity in Palestine. Apparently John in common with the other Apostles remained some twelve years in this first field of labour, until the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa I</a> led to the scattering of the Apostles through the various provinces of the Roman Empire (cf. <a href="../bible/act012.htm#vrs1">Acts 12:1-17</a>). Notwithstanding the opinion to the contrary of many writers, it does not appear improbable that John then went for the first time to <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and exercised his Apostolic office in various provinces there. In any case a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community was already in existence at Ephesus before Paul's first labours there (cf. "the brethren", <a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs27">Acts 18:27</a>, in addition to Priscilla and Aquila), and it is easy to connect a sojourn of John in these provinces with the fact that the Holy Ghost did not permit the <a href="11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> on his second missionary journey to proclaim the Gospel in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>, Mysia, and Bithynia (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs6">Acts 16:6 sq.</a>). There is just as little against such an acceptation in the later account in Acts of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's third missionary</a> journey. But in any case such a sojourn by John in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> in this first period was neither long nor uninterrupted. He returned with the other disciples to Jerusalem for the Apostolic Council (about A.D. 51). <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in opposing his enemies in Galatia names John explicitly along with Peter and James the Less as a "pillar of the Church", and refers to the recognition which his Apostolic preaching of a Gospel free from the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> received from these three, the most prominent men of the old Mother-Church at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs9">Galatians 2:9</a>). When Paul came again to Jerusalem after the second and after the third journey (<a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs22">Acts 18:22</a>; <a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs17">21:17 sq.</a>) he seems no longer to have met John there. Some wish to draw the conclusion from this that John left Palestine between the years 52 and 55.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Of the other New-Testament writings, it is only from the three Epistles of John and the Apocalypse that anything further is learned concerning the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of the Apostle. We may be permitted here to take as proven the unity of the author of these three writings handed down under the name of John and his identity with the <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>. Both the Epistles and the Apocalypse, however, presuppose that their author John belonged to the multitude of personal eyewitnesses of the life and work of Christ (cf. especially <a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#vrs1">1 John 1:1-5</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs14">4:14</a>), that he had lived for a long time in <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, was thoroughly acquainted with the conditions existing in the various <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities there, and that he had a position of authority recognized by all <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities as leader of this part of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Moreover, the Apocalypse tells us that its author was on the island of Patmos "for the word of God and for the testimony of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>", when he was <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the heavenly Revelation contained in the Apocalypse (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs9">Revelation 1:9</a>).</p>

<h2 id="ii">The alleged presbyter John</h2>

<p>The author of the Second and Third Epistles of John designates himself in the superscription of each by the name (<em>ho presbyteros</em>), "the ancient", "the old". Papias, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07322a.htm">Hierapolis</a>, also uses the same name to designate the "Presbyter John" as in addition to Aristion, his particular authority, directly after he has named the <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a> Andrew, Peter, Philip, Thomas, James, John, and Matthew (in Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.39.4</a>). <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> was the first to draw, on account of these words of Papias, the distinction between a Presbyter John and the Apostle John, and this distinction was also spread in Western <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> by <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> on the authority of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. The opinion of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> has been frequently revived by modern writers, chiefly to support the denial of the Apostolic origin of the <a href="08438a.htm">Fourth Gospel.</a> The distinction, however, has no historical basis. First, the testimony of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> in this matter is not worthy of <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>. He contradicts himself, as in his "Chronicle" he expressly calls the Apostle John the teacher of Papias ("ad annum Abrah 2114"), as does Jerome also in Ep. lxxv, "Ad Theodoram", iii, and in <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 18</a>. <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> was also influenced by his <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> opinions as he denied the Apostolic origin of the Apocalypse and ascribed this writing to an author differing from St. John but of the same name. <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> also positively designates the Apostle and <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> John as the teacher of Papias, and neither he nor any other writer before <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> had any <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a second John in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103533.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> V.33.4</a>). In what Papias himself says the connection plainly shows that in this passage by the word <em>presbyters</em> only Apostles can be understood. If John is mentioned twice the explanation lies in the peculiar relationship in which Papias stood to this, his most eminent teacher. By inquiring of others he had learned some things indirectly from John, just as he had from the other Apostles referred to. In addition he had received information concerning the teachings and acts of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> directly, without the intervention of others, from the still living "Presbyter John", as he also had from Aristion. Thus the teaching of Papias casts absolutely no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> upon what the New-Testament writings presuppose and expressly mention concerning the residence of the <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> John in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>.</p>

<h2 id="iii">The later accounts of John</h2>

<p>The <a href="06001a.htm">Christian writers</a> of the second and third centuries testify to us as a tradition universally recognized and <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> by no one that the Apostle and <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> John lived in <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> in the last decades of the first century and from Ephesus had guided the Churches of that province. In his "Dialogue with Tryphon" (Chapter 81) <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin Martyr</a> refers to "John, one of the Apostles of Christ" as a <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> who had lived "with us", that is, at Ephesus. St. Iren&aelig;us speaks in very many places of the Apostle John and his residence in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> and expressly declares that he wrote his Gospel at Ephesus (<a href="../fathers/0103301.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.1.1</a>), and that he had lived there until the reign of <a href="15015a.htm">Trajan</a> (loc. cit., II, xxii, 5). With <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.13.1</a>) and others we are <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to place the Apostle's banishment to Patmos in the reign of the <a href="05114b.htm">Emperor Domitian</a> (81-96). Previous to this, according to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> testimony (De praescript., xxxvi), John had been thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil before the Porta Latina at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> without suffering injury. After <a href="05114b.htm">Domitian's</a> death the Apostle returned to Ephesus during the reign of <a href="15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, and at Ephesus he died about A.D. 100 at a great age. Tradition reports many beautiful traits of the last years of his life: that he refused to remain under the same roof with <a href="03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> (Irenaeus "Ad. haer.", III, iii, 4); his touching anxiety about a youth who had become a robber (Clemens Alex., "Quis dives salvetur", xiii); his constantly repeated words of exhortation at the end of his life, "Little children, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> one another" (Jerome, "Comm. in ep. ad. Gal.", vi, 10). On the other hand the stories told in the <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of John, which appeared as early as the second century, are unhistorical invention.</p>

<h2 id="iv">Feasts of St. John</h2>

<p>St. John is commemorated on 27 December, which he originally shared with St. James the Greater. At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the feast was reserved to St. John alone at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, though both names are found in the Carthage Calendar, the Hieronymian Martyrology, and the Gallican <a href="09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>. The "departure" or "assumption" of the Apostle is noted in the <a href="10191b.htm">Menology</a> of Constantinople and the Calendar of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> (26 September), which seems to have been regarded as the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of his death. The feast of St. John before the Latin Gate, supposed to commemorate the dedication of the church near the Porta Latina, is first mentioned in the Sacramentary of <a href="01155b.htm">Adrian I</a> (772-95).</p>

<h2 id="v">St. John in Christian art</h2>

<p>Early <a href="03710a.htm">Christian art</a> usually represents St. John with an eagle, symbolizing the heights to which he rises in the first chapter of his Gospel. The <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> as symbolic of St. John, which, according to some authorities, was not adopted until the thirteenth century, is sometimes interpreted with reference to the <a href="14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>, again as connected with the legend according to which St. John was handed a cup of poisoned wine, from which, at his blessing, the poison rose in the shape of a serpent. Perhaps the most natural explanation is to be found in the words of Christ to John and James "My <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> indeed you shall drink" (<a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs23">Matthew 20:23</a>).</p>
