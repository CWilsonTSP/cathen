<p>This office (which has always been entrusted to a Friar Preacher) may briefly be described as being that of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>. <a href="05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, appointed in 1218, was the first Master of the Sacred Palace (<em>Magister Sacri Palatii</em>). Among the eighty-four <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> who have succeeded him, eighteen were subsequently created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, twenty-four were made <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> or <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (including some of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>), and six were elected generals of the order. Several are famous for their works on <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, etc., but only Durandus, Torquemada, Prierias, Mamachi, and <a href="11325a.htm">Orsi</a> can be mentioned here. As regards nationality: the majority have been <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a>; of the remainder ten have been <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and ten <a href="06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, one has been a German and one an Englishman (i.e. William de Boderisham, or Bonderish, 1263-1270?). It has sometimes been asserted that <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas of Aquin</a> was a Master of the Sacred Palace. This is due to a misconception. He was Lector of the Sacred Palace. The offices were not identical. (See Bullarium O. P., III, 18.) Though he and two other contemporary <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, namely his teacher Bl. <a href="01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> and his fellow pupil Bl. Ambrose Sansedonico (about both of whom the same assertion has been made) held successively the office of Lecturer on Scripture or on Theology in the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> palace <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, not one of them was Master of the Sacred Palace. Their names do not occur in the official lists. While all Masters of the Sacred Palace were <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, several members of other orders were Lectors of the Sacred Palace (e.g. Peckham O.S.F., who became <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in 1279).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>St. Dominic's work as Master of the Sacred Palace consisted partly at least in expounding the <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (Colonna, O.P., c: 1255, who says that the commentary was then extant; Flaminius; S. Antonius; <a href="09577a.htm">Malvenda</a>, in whose time the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Epistles used by the Saint as Master of the Sacred Palace was preserved in <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>; <a href="05270a.htm">Echard</a>; Renazzi; Mortier, etc.). These <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> lectures were delivered to <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> and to the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> attendants of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who, as the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> observed, had been accustomed to gather in the antechamber and to spend the time in gossip while their masters were having audiences with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. According to Renazzi (I, 25), St. Dominic may be regarded as the founder of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> palace <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, since his Biblical lectures were the occasion of its being established. Catalanus, who, however, is not guilty of the confusion alluded to above, says he was the first Lector of the Sacred Palace as well as the first Master of the Sacred Palace. In the thirteenth century the chief <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of the Master of the Sacred Palace was to lecture on Scripture and to preside over the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in Vatican: "in scholae Romanae et Pontificiae regimine et in publica sacrae scripturae expositione" (Echard). The <em>Lectores</em> or <em>Magistri scholarum S. Palatii</em> taught under him. It became customary for the Master of the Sacred Palace, according to Cardinal de Luca, to preach before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and his court in <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>. This had probably been sometimes done by St. Dominic. Up to the sixteenth century the Master of the Sacred Palace preached, but after it this work was permanently entrusted to his companion (a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>). A further division of labour was made by <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (<a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a>, "Inclyta Fratrum", 1743); at present the companion preaches to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> household, and a <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> preaches to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>.</p>

<p>But the work of the Master of the Sacred Palace as <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> continues to the present day. As it has assumed its actual form by centuries of development, we may give a summary of the legislation respecting it and the various functions it comprises and also of the honours attaching to it. The "Acta" (or "Calenda") of the Palatine officials in 1409 (under <a href="01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>) show that on certain days the Master of the Sacred Palace was bound to deliver lectures and on other days was expected, if called upon, either to propose or to answer questions at the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conference which was held in the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> presence. On 30 October, 1439, <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> decreed that the Master of the Sacred Palace should rank next to the dean of the <a href="13205c.htm">Rota</a>, that no one should preach before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> whose sermon had not been previously approved of by him, and that in accordance with ancient usage no one could be made a doctor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> but by him (Bullarium O. P., III, 81). <a href="03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> (13 November, 1455) confirmed and amplified the second part of this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, but at the same time exempted <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> from its operation (ibid., p. 356). At present it has fallen into disuse. In the <a href="09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a> (sess. x, 4 May, 1513) <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> that no book should be printed either in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> or in its district without leave from the cardinal vicar and the Master of the Sacred Palace (ibid., IV, 318). <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a> (11 June, 1620) and <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> added to the <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> imposed by this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>. So did <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> in 1663 (Bullarium, <em>passim</em>). All these later enactments regard the inhabitants of the Roman Province or of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. They were renewed by <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1 Sept., 1744). And the permission of the Master of the Sacred Palace must be got not only to print, but to publish, and before the second permission is granted, three printed copies must be deposited with him, one for himself, another for his companion, a third a for the cardinal vicar. The Roman Vicariate never examines work intended for publication. For centuries the imprimatur of the Master of the Sacred Palace who always examines them followed the <em>Si videbitur Reverendissimo Magistro Sacri Palatii</em> of the cardinal vicar; now in virtue of custom but not of any ascertained law, since about the year 1825 the cardinal vicar gives an imprimatur, and it follows that of the Master of the Sacred Palace. At present the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> once incumbent on <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of presenting their work to the Master of the Sacred Palace for his imprimatur has fallen into disuse, but through courtesy many <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> do present their works. In the Constitution "Officiorum ac munerum" (25 Jan., 1897), <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> declared that all <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> residing in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> may get leave from the Master of the Sacred Palace to read forbidden books, and that if authors who live in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> intend to get their works published elsewhere, the joint imprimatur of the cardinal vicar and the Master of the Sacred Palace renders it unnecessary to ask any other <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a>. As is well known, if an author not resident in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> desires to have his work published there, provided that an agreement with the author's Ordinary has been made and that the Master of the Sacred Palace judges favourably of the work, the imprimatur will be given. In this case the book is known by its having two title pages: the one bearing the name of the domiciliary, the other of the Roman publisher.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Before the establishment of the Congregations of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> (in 1542) and Index (1587), the Master of the Sacred Palace condemned books and forbade reading them under censure. Instances of his so doing occur regularly till about the middle of the sixteenth century; one occurred as late as 1604, but by degrees this task has been appropriated to the above-mentioned congregations of which he is an ex-officio member. The Master of the Sacred Palace was made by <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (29 July, 1570; see "Bullarium", V, 245) canon <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of St. Peter's, but this <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> was revoked by his successor <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> (11 March, 1575). From the time when <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> recognized the Roman University or "Sapienza" (5 November, 1513; by the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> "Dum suavissimos") he transferred to it the old <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> palace. The Master of the Sacred Palace became the president of the new <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty. The other members were the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> grand <a href="13322a.htm">sacristan</a> (an Augustinian), the commissary of the Holy Office (a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>), the procurators general of the five Mendicant Orders, i.e. <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> (Conventual), Augustinian, <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, and <a href="09750a.htm">Servite</a>, and the professors who succeeded to the ancient Lectors of the Sacred Palace. <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> is by some regarded as the founder of this college or faculty, but he may have only given its definite form. He is said to have confirmed the prerogative enjoyed by the Master of the Sacred Palace of conferring all degrees of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Instances of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> diplomas implying this power of the Master of the Sacred Palace occur in the "Bullarium" <em>passim</em> (e.g. of <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, 6 June, 1406). The presidential authority of the Master of the Sacred Palace over this, the greatest <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was confirmed by <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> in 1824.</p>

<p>Since the occupation of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1870 the Sapienza has been laicized and turned into a state <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, so that on the special occasions when the Master of the Sacred Palace holds an examination, e.g. for the purpose of examining all that are to be appointed to sees in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, or again of conferring the title of S.T.D., he does so, with the assistance of the high dignitaries just mentioned, in his apartment in the Vatican. He is also examiner in the concursus for <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> which are held in the Roman Vicariate. Before <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> issued the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> referred to above, the Master of the Sacred Palace was in processions, etc., the dignitary immediately under the Apostolic <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, but when this <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> raised the auditors of the <a href="13205c.htm">Rota</a> to the rank of Apostolic <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, he gave the Master of the Sacred Palace the place immediately next to the dean who was in charge of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="10404a.htm">mitre</a>. In 1655, <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> put the other auditors of the <a href="13205c.htm">Rota</a> above the Master of the Sacred Palace. This was done, according to Cardinal de Luca, solely because one white and black habit looked badly among several violet soutanes. One of the occasional <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the Master of the Sacred Palace is performed in conjunction with the auditors of the <a href="13205c.htm">Rota</a>; namely to watch over the three apertures or "drums" through which during a <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> receive all communications. In <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> processions, the Master of the Sacred Palace walks next to the auditors, immediately behind the bearer of the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a>.</p>

<p>Though he has, as we have seen, gradually lost some of his ancient authority and rank, nevertheless at the present day the Master of the Sacred Palace is a very high official. He is one of the three Palatine <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> (the others being the Maggiordomo and the Grand Almoner) to whom as to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> guards present arms. He is always addressed, even by <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, as "Most Reverend". In the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> he ranks next to the general, ex-general, and <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. He is ex-officio consultor of the Holy Office, prelate-consultor of Rites, and perpetual assistant of the Index. He is consultor of the <a href="02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a>, and is frequently consulted on various matters by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as his <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>. His offical audience occurs once a fortnight. The offical apartment of the Master of the Sacred Palace was in the Quirinal, and until recently it contained the unbroken series of portraits of the Masters of the Sacred Palace, from St. Dominic down. These frescoes have been effaced by the present occupants of the Quirinal, but copies of them are to be seen in the temporary apartment of the Master of the Sacred Palace in the Vatican.</p>
