<p>The Seventeenth Ecumenical Council was, correctly speaking, the continuation of the Council of <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, transferred to the <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> capital because of the pest; or, indeed, a continuation of the <a href="02334b.htm">Council of Basle</a>, which was convoked in 1431 by <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. In the end the last-named assembly became a revolutionary <em>conciliabulum</em>, and is to be judged variously, according as we consider the manner of its convocation, its membership, or its results. Generally, however, it is ranked as an <a href="04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> until the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of dissolution in 1437. After its transfer to <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, the first session of the council was held 10 Jan., 1438. <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> proclaimed it the regular continuation of the Council of Basle, and hence its ecumenical character is admitted by all.</p>

<p>The <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1414-18) had seen the growth of a fatal theory, based on the writings of <a href="05207a.htm">William Durandus</a> (Guillaume Durant), <a href="08475b.htm">John of Paris</a>, Marsiglio of Padua, and <a href="15636a.htm">William of Occam</a>, i.e. the <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> theory that proclaimed the superiority of the council over the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. It was the outcome of much previous conflict and embitterment; was hastily voted in a time of angry confusion by an incompetent body; and, besides leading eventually to the deplorable articles of the "Declaratio Cleri Gallicani" (see <a href="06351a.htm">GALLICANISM</a>), almost provoked at the time new <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a>. Influenced by this theory, the members of the <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the thirty-fifth general session (9 October, 1417) five decrees, the first being the famous <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> known as "Frequens", according to which an <a href="04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> should be held every ten years. In other words, the council was henceforth to be a permanent, indispensable institution, that is, a kind of religious parliament meeting at regular intervals, and including amongst its members the ambassadors of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns; hence the ancient <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> monarchy, elective but absolute, was to give way to a constitutional oligarchy.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>While <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, naturally enough, refused to recognize these decrees, he was unable to make headway openly against a movement which he considered fatal. In accordance, therefore, with the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> "Frequens" he convoked an <a href="04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> at Pavia for 1423, and later, yielding to popular opinion, which even many <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> countenanced, summoned a new council at Basle to settle the difficulties raised by the anti-Hussite <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>. A <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1 Feb., 1431, named as president of the council Giuliano Cesarini, <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Sant' Angelo, whom the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had sent to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> to preach a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="07585a.htm">Hussites</a>. <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> died suddenly (20 February, 1431), before the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of convocation and the legatine faculties reached Cesarini. However, the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> (Gabriele Condolmieri), confirmed the acts of his predecessor with the reservation that further events might cause him to revoke his decision. He referred probably to the reunion of the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, discussed between <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a> and the Byzantine emperor (John Palaeologus), but put off by reason of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> death. <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> laboured most earnestly for reunion, which he was destined to see accomplished in the Council of Ferrara-Florence. The Council of Basle had begun in a rather burlesque way. Canon Beaup&egrave;re of <a href="02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, who had been sent from Basle to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, gave the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> an unfavourable and exaggerated account of the temper of the people of Basle and its environs. <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> thereupon dissolved the council before the close of 1431, and convoked it anew at Bologna for the summer of 1433, providing at the same time for the participation of the Greeks. Cesarini, however, had already opened the council of Basle, and now insisted vigorously that the aforesaid <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> act should be withdrawn. Yielding to the aggressive attitude of the Basle assembly, whose members proclaimed anew the <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> theory, <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> gradually modified his attitude towards them, and exhibited in general, throughout these painful dissensions, a very conciliatory temper.</p>

<p>Many reform-decrees were <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the council, and, though never executed, contributed towards the final rupture. Ultimately, the unskilful negotiations of the council with the Greeks on the question of reunion moved <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> to transfer it to <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. The embassy sent from Basle to Constantinople (1435), Giovanni di Ragusa, Heinrich Henger, and Simon Fr&eacute;ron, insisted obstinately on holding at Basle the council which was to promote the union of the two Churches, but in this matter the Byzantine Emperor refused to give way. With all the Greeks he wished the council to take place in some Italian city near the sea, preferably in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. At Basle the majority insisted, despite the Greeks, that the council of reunion should be convoked at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, but a minority sided with the Greeks and was by them recognized as the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> council. Hereupon <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> approved the action of the minority (29 May, 1437), and for this was summoned to appear before the council. He replied by dissolving it on 18 September. Wearied of the obstinacy of the majority at Basle, Cardinal Cesarini and his adherents then quitted the city and went to <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, whither <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, as stated above, had transferred the council by <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of 30 December, 1437, or 1 January, 1438.</p>

<p>The <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> Council opened on 8 January, 1438, under the presidency of <a href="01258b.htm">Cardinal Niccol&ograve; Albergati</a>, whom the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had commissioned to represent him until he could appear in person. It had, of course, no other objects than those of Basle, i.e. reunion of the Churches, reforms, and the restoration of peace between <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples. The first session of the council took place 10 January, 1438. It declared the Council of Basle transferred to <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and annulled in advance any and all future decrees of the Basle assembly. When <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> heard that the Greeks were nearing the coast of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he set off (24 January) for <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and three days later made his solemn entry into the city. The manner of voting was first discussed by the members of the council. Should it be, as at <a href="04288a.htm">Constance</a>, by nations (<em>nationes</em>), or by committees (<em>commissiones</em>)? It was finally decided to divide the members into three estates:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>;</li><li>the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>;</li><li>the <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> and other members.</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In order that the vote of any estate might count, it was resolved that a majority of two-thirds should be required, and it was hoped that this provision would remove all possibility of the recurrence of the regrettable dissensions at <a href="04288a.htm">Constance</a>. At the second public session (15 February) these decrees were <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the members of the Basle assembly, which still continued to sit. The Greeks soon appeared at <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, headed by Emperor John Palaeologus and Joasaph, the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and numbered about seven hundred. The solemn sessions of the council began on 9 April, 1438, and were held in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> under the presidency of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. On the Gospel side of the altar rose the (unoccupied) throne of the Western Emperor (Sigismund of Luxemburg), who had died only a month previously; on the Epistle side was placed the throne of the Greek Emperor. Besides the emperor and his brother Demetrius, there were present, on the part of the Greeks, Joasaph, the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople; Antonius, the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="07242b.htm">Heraclea</a>; Gregory Hamma, the Protosyncellus of Constantinople (the last two representing the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>); Marcus Eugenicus of Ephesus; <a href="08188a.htm">Isidore of Kiev</a> (representing the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>); Dionysius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13472a.htm">Sardes</a> (representing the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>); <a href="02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>; <a href="02226b.htm">Balsamon</a>, the chief chartophylax; Syropulos, the chief ecclesiarch, and the Bishops of Monembasia, Lacedaemon, and Anchielo. In the discussions the Latins were represented principally by Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini and <a href="01258b.htm">Cardinal Niccol&ograve; Albergati</a>. Andrew, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>; the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Forl&igrave;; the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> John of Turrecremata; and Giovanni di Ragusa, <a href="12514b.htm">provincial</a> of <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>.</p>

<p>Preliminary discussions brought out the main points of difference between the Greeks and the Latins, viz. the Procession of the Holy Spirit, the <a href="02171a.htm">azymes</a>, <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, and the primacy. During these preliminaries the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and good intentions of the Greek Emperor were evident. Serious discussion began apropos of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. Cesarini and Turrecremata were the chief Latin speakers, the latter in particular engaging in a violent discussion with Marcus Eugenicus. <a href="02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, speaking for the Greeks, made clear the divergency of opinion existing among the Greeks themselves on the question of <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. This stage of the discussion closed on 17 July, whereupon the council rested for a time, and the Greek Emperor took advantage of the respite to join eagerly in the pleasures of the chase with the Duke of <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>.</p>

<p>When the council met again (8 Oct., 1438), the chief (indeed, thenceforth the only) subject of discussion was the <a href="06073a.htm"><em>Filioque.</em></a> The Greeks were represented by <a href="02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, Marcus Eugenicus, Isidore of Kiev, <a href="12166a.htm">Gemistus Plethon</a>, <a href="02226b.htm">Balsamon</a>, and Kantopulos; on the Latin side were Cardinals Cesarini and <a href="01258b.htm">Niccol&ograve; Albergati</a>, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Forl&igrave;, and Giovanni di Ragusa. In this and the following fourteen sessions, the Filioque was the sole subject of discussion. In the fifteenth session it became clear that the Greeks were unwilling to consent to the insertion of this expression in the Creed, although it was imperative for the good of the church and as a safeguard against future <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Many Greeks began to despair of realizing the projected union and spoke of returning to Constantinople. To this the emperor would not listen; he still hoped for a reconciliation, and in the end succeeded in appeasing the heated spirits of his partisans. <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> now announced his intention of transferring the council to <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in consequence of pecuniary straits and the outbreak of the pest at <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Many Latins had already died, and of the Greeks the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Sardis and the entire household of Isidore of Kiev were attacked by the disease. The Greeks finally consented to the transfer, and in the sixteenth and last session at <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> the <a href="03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> was read, in both Latin and Greek, by which the council was transferred to Florence (January, 1439).</p>

<p>The seventeenth session of the council (the first at Florence) took place in the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> palace on 26 February. In nine consecutive sessions, the Filioque was the chief matter of discussion. In the last session but one (twenty-fourth of <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, eighth of Florence) Giovanni di Ragusa set forth clearly the Latin <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in the following terms: "the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> recognizes but <em>one</em> principle, <em>one</em> cause of the Holy Spirit, namely, the Father. It is from the Father that the Son holds his place in the 'Procession' of the Holy Ghost. It is in this sense that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father, but He proceeds <em>also</em> from the Son." In the last session, the same <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> again expounded the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, after which the public sessions were closed at the request of the Greeks, as it seemed useless to prolong further the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussions. At this juncture began the active efforts of Isidore of Kiev, and, as the result of further parleys, <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> submitted four propositions summing up the result of the previous discussion and exposing the weakness of the attitude of the Greeks. As the latter were loath to admit defeat, <a href="02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a>, in a special meeting of the Greeks, on 13 and 14 April, 1439, delivered his famous discourse in favour of reunion, and was supported by Georgius Scholarius. Both parties now met again, after which, to put an end to all equivocation, the Latins drew up and read a declaration of their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in which they stated that they did not admit <em>two</em> "principia" in the Trinity, but only one, the productive power of the Father <em>and</em> the Son, and that the Holy Ghost proceeds <em>also</em> from the Son. They admitted, therefore, two hypostases, one action, one productive power, and one product due to the substance and the hypostases of the Father and the Son. The Greeks met this statement with an equivocal counter-formula, whereupon <a href="02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>, Isidore of Kiev, and Dortheus of <a href="10407a.htm">Mitylene</a>, encouraged by the emperor, came out strongly in favour of the <em>ex filio.</em></p>

<p>The reunion of the Churches was at last really in sight. When, therefore, at the request of the emperor, <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> promised the Greeks the military and financial help of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as a consequence of the projected reconciliation, the Greeks declared (3 June, 1439) that they recognized the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father <em>and</em> the Son as from <em>one</em> "principium" (<em>arche</em>) and from <em>one</em> cause (<em>aitia</em>). On 8 June, a final agreement was reached concerning this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The Latin teaching respecting the <a href="02171a.htm">azymes</a> and <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a> was also accepted by the Greeks. As to the primacy, they declared that they would grant the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> all the privileges he had before the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. An amicable agreement was also reached regarding the form of <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> in the Mass (see <a href="05502a.htm">EPIKLESIS</a>). Almost simultaneously with these measures the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople died, 10 June; not, however, before he had drawn up and signed a declaration in which he admitted the Filioque, <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, and the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy. Nevertheless the reunion of the Churches was not yet an accomplished fact. The Greek representatives insisted that their aforesaid declarations were only their personal opinions; and as they stated that it was still <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to obtain the assent of the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> in synod assembled, seemingly insuperable difficulties threatened to annihilate all that had so far been achieved. On 6 July, however, the famous <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of union (Laetentur Coeli), the original which is still preserved in the Laurentian Library at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, was formally announced in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of that city. The council was over, as far as the Greeks were concerned, and they departed at once. The Latin members remained to promote the reunion with the other <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>--the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> (1439), the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> (1442), the Mesopotamians, between the Tigris and the Euphrates (1444), the Chaldeans or <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, and the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> of <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (1445). This last was the concluding public act of the Council of Florence, the proceedings of which from 1443 onwards took place in the Lateran palace at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<p>The erudition of <a href="02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> and the energy of Isidore of Kiev were chiefly responsible for the reunion of the Churches as accomplished at Florence. The question now was to secure its adoption in the East. For this purpose Isidore of Kiev was sent to <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> and <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, but the Muscovite princes, jealous of their religious interdependence, refused to abide by the decrees of the Council of Florence. Isidore was thrown into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, but afterwards escaped and took refuge in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Nor was any better headway made in the Greek Empire. The emperor remained faithful, but some of the Greek deputies, intimidated by the discontent prevailing amongst their own people, deserted their position and soon fell back into the surrounding mass of <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. The new emperor, Constantine, brother of John Palaeologus, vainly endeavoured to overcome the opposition of the Byzantine <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. Isidore of Kiev was sent to Constantinople to bring about the desired acceptance of the Florentine "Decretum Unionis" (Laetentur Coeli), but, before he could succeed in his mission, the city fell (1453) before the advancing hordes of Mohammed II.</p>

<p>One advantage, at least, resulted from the Council of Florence: it proclaimed before both Latins and Greeks that the <a href="12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> was the foremost <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>; and <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> was able to arrest the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> which had been threatening the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a> anew (see <a href="02334b.htm">COUNCIL OF BASLE</a>). This council was, therefore, witness to the prompt rehabilitation of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy, and facilitated, the return of men like Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, who in his youth had taken part in the Council of Basle, but ended by recognizing its <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> attitude, and finally became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name <a href="12126c.htm">Pius II</a>.</p>
