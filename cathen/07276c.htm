<p><a href="12025c.htm">Philosopher</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Dreierwalde near Theine (Westphalia), 22 April, 1775; d. at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a> on the Rhine, 26 May 1831. After completing his course in the gymnasium, or high school, at Rheine, Hermes studied <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="10639a.htm">University of M&uuml;nster</a> from 1792 until 1794. He then took up <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> in order to remove the <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> regarding <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> awakened in his mind by the study of <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> and Fechte. Initiated as he was into the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> by professors of limited ability, and altogether dissatisfied with the traditional methods of <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a>, he determined for the time being to adhere to the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as set forth in the Catechism, but afterwards to seek on his own account a better basis for the <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In 1797 Hermes became professor at the M&uuml;nster gymnasium; in 1799 he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. The first work he wrote, "Untersuchung &uuml;ber die innere Wahrheit des Christentums" (M&uuml;nster, 1805), in which he sought to demonstrate the harmony between reason and revelation, was received with so much favour that in 1807 its author, warmly commended by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> Niemeyer, at Halle, was appointed to a chair of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="10639a.htm">University of M&uuml;nster</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Hermes lectured on <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, and, with especial zest, on the introduction to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. Impressive and attractive in appearance, he was highly esteemed by his students because of his extraordinary pedagogic ability and his exemplary <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> bearing. He also earned the respect and appreciation of his colleagues by his <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> devotion to the interests of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>; up to 1819 they elected him dean three times. But his <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> methods of instruction, which were out of harmony with the <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of the past, roused opposition among the ruling circles at M&uuml;nster including several men of eminence, such as <a href="05161b.htm">Clement August von Droste-Vischering</a> (later <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>), <a href="14299b.htm">Frederick von Stolberg</a>, Obverberg, Katerkamp, Kistemaker, Kellermann. When the <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> <a href="05161b.htm">von Droste-Vischering</a>, who was at the head of the administration of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> during a vacancy of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, demanded that Hermes should continue the use of the Latin tongue in the dogmatic lectures, the latter refused to obey. The same <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>, by order of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, denied the legality of the uncanonical reorganization of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter by <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, refused to acknowledge the wrongful appointment of Baron von Spiegel (later <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>) as <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and on 31 March 1813, took back into his own hands the government of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Thereupon Hermes published a voluminous opinion disputing his right to such a procedure ("Gutachten in Streitsachen des M&uuml;nsterschen Domkapitels mit dem Generalvikar des Kapitels. Mit Bewilligung des hochw&uuml;rdigen Domkapitels herausgegeben", M&uuml;nster, 1815). As confidential adviser of the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> ministry he wrote at its request, particularly between the years 1815 and 1819, several important opinions, e.g. the one published in 1818 concerning the establishment of a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at the new <a href="02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a>. His loyalty to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is attested by the opinion he wrote condemning the inaccurate and <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> translation of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> by Carl and Leander van Ess and the first-named author's "Geschichte der Vulgata". Although the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> ministry, to his deep regret, reduced the M&uuml;nster University to the rank of an academy in 1818, Hermes refused a call to the new <a href="02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a> just as firmly as he had declined, in 1816, the offer of a professorial chair at the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>. In 1819 Hermes published "Die philosophische Einleitung", the first part of his principal work "Einleitung in die christ-katholische Theologie" (M&uuml;nster, 1819; 2nd ed., 1831). The purpose of this book was to put an end to all <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> regarding three questions which are of fundamental importance to all religious conviction, and especially to that of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. These questions are: Whether there is any <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> at all; <a href="06608b.htm">whether God exists</a>, and what are His attributes; whether a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation is possible, and under what conditions. The <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> conferred on his the degree of Doctor of Theology <em>honoris caus&acirc;</em> for his "Philosophische Einleitung." After that Hermes, yielding to the persistent urging of the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government, accepted the chair of <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, 27 April, 1820. His inaugural lecture dealt with the relation of <a href="14580a.htm">positive theology</a> to the general principles of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> (see "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Philosophie und katholische Theologie", 1833, pp. 52-61). His election, 3 August 1820, as "Rector Magnificus", which he declined, and the degree of Doctor of Philosophy <em>honoris caus&acirc;</em>, which the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty of Bonn subsequently conferred on him, in 1821, are ample evidence of the respect paid to him in Bonn. The <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in Breisgau tried in vain to secure him for its faculty. His lectures on philosophy, the introduction to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, and <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> attracted a tremendous following in Bonn, being attended even by large numbers of philologists and jurists. The <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> ministry suspended the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty in M&uuml;nster for six months, on account of the <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> which the <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> Clement August issued against Hermes, forbidding all <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students in the <a href="10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a> to attend any outside <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> without his permission. It was revoked immediately upon the retirement of the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. The <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> in the <a href="11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a> were also forbidden by the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> to attend Hermes' lectures. To please Hermes, the Government in 1825 dismissed his colleague Seber who was not in sympathy with him. Moreover, the Archbishop Baron von Spiegel, who had been a patron of Hermes even in his M&uuml;nster days, appointed him a member of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, examiner to the synod, and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> counsellor in <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, without disturbing his professorial <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> or <a href="11189a.htm">obliging</a> him to reside at Cologne.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As examiner, Hermes was a bitter opponent of all <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who did not share his views. Like the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, to which only pupils of Hermes had been appointed since 1826 (<a href="01104a.htm">Achterfeldt</a>, Braun, Vogelsang, M&uuml;ller), the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Cologne and a large part of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were soon imbued with his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Even the other faculties of Bonn included followers of his, particularly Professor Clement August von Droste-H&uuml;lshoff in law and Elvenich in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In a very short time the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, and Braunsberg, the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, many <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters and instructorships in religion at the gymnasia were filled with Hermesians. In 1830 Hermes cast the decisive vote against calling M&uuml;hler and <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> to the chair of <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a>. On the other hand the appointment of <a href="08666a.htm">Professor Klee</a> for <a href="05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a> and <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> implied a distinct concession to the anti-Hermesian movement which in the meantime had been slowly gathering strength. Hermes began to publish the second part of his "Introduction to Theology", the "Positive Einleitung", or "Positive Introduction", in 1829 (M&uuml;nster, 1829, 2nd ed., 1834). Therein he sought to demonstrate the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by way of completing the "Philosophical Introduction". The "Philosophical Introduction" having shown the possibility of proving that <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is both extrinsically and intrinsically <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, and having shown also how the demonstration should proceed, we have now got to the point of furnishing this <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> such is the purpose of the "Positive Introduction" (Positive Introduction, 1). In carrying out this purpose he investigates five questions: (1) Are the books of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> externally (historically) <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>? (2) Is the so-called oral tradition likewise historically <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>? (3) Are the expositions and interpretations of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus'</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as communicated by the oral teaching of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="07790a.htm">infallibly</a> correct? (4) Are the teachings of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> contained in the books of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> intrinsically <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>? (5) Are the teachings of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> that have been handed down by oral tradition likewise intrinsically <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>?</p>

<p>In its essence Hermes' <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> system, or "Hermesianism", was <a href="12652a.htm">rationalism</a>; and, though in many respects opposed to the doctrines of <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> and Fichte, it was strongly influenced by them. According to Hermes our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is subjectively <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> when we are convinced in our minds that it coincides with its object. This conviction, however, becomes a <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> when it is irresistible. The necessity of our conviction, therefore, is the criterion of objective <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. This necessity is either physical or moral, that is, it is either independent of, or dependent on, <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> and <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>. It comes to pass in two ways: it is either forced upon us, or we admit it freely. In the first case, we call our conviction <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, in the second, acceptance of a <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. Belief in a <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> is a matter of theoretical reason, while acceptance is a matter of practical, or obligating, reason. Belief in a <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> is in part the result of mediate necessity, in which case it is founded either on <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>, i.e. on the clearness and vividness of the <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> content, or on insight (understanding); in part, also, it springs from immediate necessity, and only in this case is <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> philosophically certain. "It is of immediate necessity that we must accept the following proposition as <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, together with all propositions subordinate to it: Everything that is must have a sufficient reason" (Philosophische Einleitung, no. 14). Now the first and most immediate reality, that is forced upon the reason of direct necessity, is inseparably connected with the consciousness that <em>I <a href="08673a.htm">know</a></em>, and with the thought that <em>something is there.</em> In order to discover the sufficient reason for this first reality, we are referred to the world as it appears to us, both within and outside of ourselves. The variations which occur in these phenomena require a sufficient reason in order to account for them; the variations in the origin of things call for a sufficient and absolute reason for their origin, and this ultimately can only be found in the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. In such wise Hermes proves the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a> along lines of theoretical reason in contradistinction to <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a>, who treated the acknowledgment of <a href="06608b.htm">God's existence</a> as a postulate of practical reason.</p>

<p>The <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a> and of His attributes, which determine His relation to the world and to <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a>, is a preliminary condition indispensable to the solution of the question as to whether <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation is possible. Hermes answers this question in the affirmative, first, because <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is able directly to produce representations in the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>, and secondly, because by means of representations man can be convinced of the intrinsic <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of conceptions supernaturally imparted to him, and also of conceptions naturally produced by himself, the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of which he cannot himself demonstrate (cf. Philosophische Einleitung, no. 74). The question of the fact of a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation must be distinguished from the question of its possibility. Revelation, said Hermes, must be admitted as a fact so soon as it can be shown that a message has emanated supernaturally from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of the practical reason to admit revelation as a fact is demonstrated if in any alleged <a href="13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> all the conditions are present on fulfillment of which it can and must be accepted for what it purports to be. Hermes, however, deems it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make a very questionable distinction between <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and non-philosophers in regard to the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of accepting revelation. No precept of practical reason, he says, can <a href="11189a.htm">oblige</a> the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, who has a well-founded confidence in his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to accept a revelation that was imparted to him supernaturally, even if he had ascertained it <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character, and even it if fulfilled all the conditions of a Divine origin. For the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> can, through his own discerning perceive very definitely his natural <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, and he will always be convinced that he does so perceive them. Consequently, practical reason cannot <a href="11189a.htm">oblige</a> him to look for this perception outside of himself, or to accept it if offered to him unsought, whether by another <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> or by superhuman agency.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when a revelation known to be <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> is offered to a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> unversed in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, he is bound by practical reason to accept it in order that he may learn his natural <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a>. He must accept it, since he could not otherwise acquire the sum total of needful <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, being unable to attain it by <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> methods. If, however, it is incumbent on the great majority of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> &#151; consisting, of course, of non-philosophers &#151; to obey the behests of practical reason by <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> in revelation, then neither can the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> refuse to accept the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of revelation; reflective theoretical reason obliges him to accept it. At the most he could refuse to do so only on the ground that he had not yet been convinced of its Divine origin, since the fact that it could not be of any advantage to him would be no reason for withholding his acquiescence in its Divine origin. In order, therefore, to deny this <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> of the Divine origin of revelation, he must assume that what others, millions in fact, are in strictest <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> bound to assume as <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> may possible by <a href="05781a.htm">untrue</a>, and that <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> reason when it leads <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> of absolute necessity to believe something to be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> can guide them to the opposite of objective <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hermes' <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> conception of the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of revelation follows from this line of argument; and furthermore he says expressly that reason cannot teach the existence of <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> of such primary importance and yet declare that it is unable to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> them.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Again, Hermes' opinions on the <em>motiva credibilitatis</em> were quite absurd. Theoretical reason, he said, can accept the probability of the Divine origin of extraordinary phenomena (<a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> and prophecies) only because it does not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> all the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the natural world, while practical reason, for the sake of <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, can accept their <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> origin as certainly <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>. Theoretical reason, for example, could not assert with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> that the revival of a decomposing corpse was of <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> origin, whereas practical reason could. For, if such a phenomenon could have a natural cause, men should be allowed to act accordingly and, in this case, to delay the burial of the corpse because the possibility of a natural reanimation was as yet by no means excluded. In this way Hermes sought to demonstrate the moral <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of accepting <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> under certain circumstances, in opposition to <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> who had laid it down as a moral principle never to presuppose the <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a>. Furthermore, Hermes denied that <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> afforded conclusive testimony in favour of revelation; he distinguished between the <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the supernaturalness of <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> and the <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the Divinity of a revelation. That many of the <a href="10338a.htm">supernatural miracles</a> worked by higher intelligent powers are of Divine origin can only be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by the contents of the revelation and its moral character. A revelation shown to be genuine to the satisfaction of practical reason demonstrates the Divinity of the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>.</p>

<p>According to Hermes, the starting-point and chief principle of every <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, and hence of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> also, is not only methodical <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>, but positive <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>. One can believe only what one has perceived to be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> from reasonable grounds, and consequently one must have the <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> to continue doubting until one has found reliable grounds to satisfy the reason. We may follow only where reason leads us, because this is the only guide that the Author of our being has given us for this life. Hermes differentiated the <em>Herzensglaube</em>, or <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> of the heart, i.e. the accepting of <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> dictated by the will, from the <em>Vernunftglaube</em>, or <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> of the reason, brought about by scientific demonstration. He says,</p>

<blockquote><p>In order that one's <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> may be efficacious it is not enough for the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, impelled by the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of our <a href="05749a.htm">cognitive faculties</a>, to acquiesce in the evidence of all these <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> which reason or revelation teaches or establishes, nor to adhere firmly to the same consequence, but it is also required that men should surrender themselves to these <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> (realities). Efficacious <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> dictated by reason, which is subject to necessity and can, therefore, be demonstrated, but the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the heart, that cannot be compelled by any <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a>, but is accepted by a free, unconditional surrender of the will. It is for reason to prevent us from <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> blindly or in a visionary way, but it is for the will as a free agent to impel us to work by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. (Christkatholische Dogmatik, III, no. 285)</p></blockquote>

<p>Although he was absolutely lacking in originality as a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and although as a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> his acquaintance with the traditional <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> was very limited, Hermes soon acquired a following. In philosophy there were Esser, Biunde, and Elvenich; in ethics G. Braun and Vogelsang; in natural and ecclesiastical law Droste-H&uuml;lshoff, all of whom treated their subjects according the Hermesian way of thinking, while <a href="01104a.htm">Achterfeldt</a> and Siemers wrote for use in the higher <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> textbooks of religious instructions incorporating his views. Among his other disciples were Baltzer, Hilgers, Rosenbaum, and J.W.J. Braun. The last-named, together with <a href="01104a.htm">Achterfeldt</a>, founded the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Philosophie und katholische Theologie" (1832-52) in defence of Hermes' <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Baron von Spiegel, continued to champion Hermesianism even after the death of its author, and he silenced by repeated favourable reports the <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> that had been awakened in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as to correctness of the new <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.</p>

<p>Hitherto only individual attacks had been made on Hermesian <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. With the exception of a few anonymous articles in Mastiaux's "Literaturzeitung" (1820, p. 369-394), and in the "Ashaffenburger Kirchenzeitung", Windischmann was the first to write an incisive and thorough criticism of Hermes' doctrines, in the "Katholik", 1825. But the controversy became sharp and bitter when <a href="07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>, in a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 26 September, 1835, condemned the Hermesian system and placed both "Introductions" as well as the first part of the "Dogmatik" on the Index. The same fate befell the second and third parts of the "Dogmatik" in a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of 7 January 1836. Prior to the issuing of this condemnation, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, at the solicitation of several German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, advised by Windischmann and <a href="02570c.htm">Binterim</a> among others, had ordered the most thorough investigation possible. Prominent <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, such as <a href="12730c.htm">Reisach</a>, director of studies in the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> and later <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and <a href="11702b.htm">Father Perrone</a>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> dogmatist, were entrusted with the task of examining Hermesian doctrines. The <a href="03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> characterized the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of Hermesianism as "false, rash, captious, leading to scepticism and indifferentism, <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a>, harmful to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, subversive of Divine <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, savouring of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and already condemned by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>." The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> expressly designated the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> points in which Hermes had diverged from the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, namely: on the nature and <a href="05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>; on <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a> and tradition, Revelation, and the teaching office of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; the <em>motiva credibilitatis</em>, the <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, and the doctrines concerning the nature, <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>, <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, and freedom of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and His ultimate purpose in His works ad extra; on the necessity of grace and its bestowal; on the reward and punishment of men; on the original state of our <a href="01129a.htm">first parents</a>; on <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> and on the powers of man in the fallen state.</p>

<p>The Hermesians tried to weaken the force of the impression produced by this unexpected condemnation and to prevent the carrying out of the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>. In fact, they succeeded in inducing the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government to forbid the publication of the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>, and H&uuml;sgen, <a href="15401c.htm">Vicar Capitular</a> of Cologne, enjoined "strict silence" on his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in respect to the condemnation, on the pretext that the document had not come to him in the regular course of official procedure, through the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government. On the contrary, the new <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="05161b.htm">Clement August von Droste-Vischering</a>, former <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of M&uuml;nster, demanded the submission of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> professors at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, forbade <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students to attend the lectures of <a href="12677a.htm">recusant</a> professors, and compelled the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, on their appointment, to repudiate the Hermesian <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> in eighteen theses. Although it was not in sympathy with the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> measures, the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government, on 21 April 1837, forbade the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> professors at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, as well as the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="15652c.htm">Windischmann</a> and the canonist Walter, to take part in any controversy on the subject of Hermesianism. The Bonn professors, Braun and Elvenich, made a last attempt to vindicate the system, journeying to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in May, 1837, in order to prevail upon the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to withdraw the condemnation by emphasizing the (<a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>) <em>distinctio juris et facti.</em> The repeated personal interviews they had with the Secretary of State, <a href="08760b.htm">Cardinal Lambruschini</a>, and with the General of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Father Roothan, who had been entrusted with their case, were just as fruitless as was their comprehensive treatise on Hermesianism entitled: "Meletemata theologica", which was handed back to them unopened (printed, in Latin, at <a href="09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, in 1839; in German, at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, in 1839, under the title "Theologische Studien"). After their return in April, 1838, they both gave a one-sided version of their unsuccessful mission in the monograph "Acta Romana" (printed at <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a> and Leipzig, 1838).</p>

<p>Most of the Hermesians now gave up their cause for lost and submitted, some of them spontaneously, and some at the demand of their <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Thanks to the energetic action of Cardinal-Archbishop von Geissel of Cologne in particular, Hermesianism was completely eradicated, and in 1860 even the most stubborn Hermesians, Braun and <a href="01104a.htm">Achterfeldt</a>, returned to their allegiance. Since their dismissal from their academic professorships in 1844, they had for a long time continued their defence of Hermesianism in their periodical and in polemical pamphlets, but they had only a few followers. The <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, with special reference to the doctrines of Hermes (cf. Cone. Coll. Lac., VII, 166d, 184bc), in the "Constitutio de fide catholic&acirc;", cap. iii, can. v, defined the freedom of the act of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and the necessity of grace for <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (see <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 1814).</p>
