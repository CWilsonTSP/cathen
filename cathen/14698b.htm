<p>In a broad sense, Thomism is the name given to the system which follows the teaching of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions. In a restricted sense the term is applied to a group of opinions held by a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> called Thomistic, composed principally, but not exclusively, of members of the <a href="12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, these same opinions being attacked by other <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> or <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, many of whom profess to be followers of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>To Thomism in the first sense are opposed, e.g., the <a href="13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, who deny that satisfaction is a part of the proximate matter (<em>materia proxima</em>) of the <a href="11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. Anti-Thomists, in this sense of the word, reject opinions admittedly taught by St. Thomas.</li><li>To Thomism in the second sense are opposed, e.g. the <a href="10437a.htm">Molinists</a>, as well as all who defend the moral instrumental <a href="03459a.htm">causality</a> of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in producing grace against the system of physical instrumental <a href="03459a.htm">causality</a>, the latter being a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Thomistic School.</li></ul></div>

<p>Anti-Thomism in such cases does not necessarily imply opposition to St. Thomas: It means opposition to tenets of the Thomistic School. Cardinal Billot, for instance, would not admit that he opposed St. Thomas by rejecting the Thomistic theory on the <a href="03459a.htm">causality</a> of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. In the Thomistic School, also, we do not always find absolute unanimity. <a href="02247a.htm">Ba&ntilde;ez</a> and <a href="02567a.htm">Billuart</a> do not always agree with Cajetan, though all belong to the Thomistic School. It does not come within the scope of this article to determine who have the best right to be considered the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> exponents of St. Thomas.</p>

<h2 id="i">The doctrine in general</h2>

<h3 id="A">Early opposition overcome</h3>

<p>Although <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (d. 1274) was highly esteemed by all classes, his opinions did not at once gain the ascendancy and influence which they acquired during the first half of the fourteenth century and which they have since maintained. Strange as it may appear, the first serious opposition came from <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, of which he was such an ornament, and from some of his own monastic brethren. In the year 1277 Stephen Tempier, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, censured certain <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> propositions, embodying doctrines taught by St. Thomas, relating especially to the principle of individuation and to the possibility of creating several <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> of the same species. In the same year <a href="08644a.htm">Robert Kilwardby</a>, a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, in conjunction with some <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> of Oxford, condemned those same propositions and moreover attacked <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the unity of the substantial form in man. <a href="08644a.htm">Kilwardby</a> and his associates pretended to see in the condemned propositions something of <a href="02150c.htm">Averroistic</a> <a href="01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>, whilst the secular <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> had not fully forgiven one who had triumphed over them in the controversy as to the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant friars</a>. The storm excited by these condemnations was of short duration. Blessed <a href="01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>, in his old age, hastened to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> to defend his beloved disciple. The <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, assembled in general chapter at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1278 and at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1279, adopted severe measures against the members who had spoken injuriously of the venerable Brother Thomas. When William de la Mare, O.S.F., wrote a "Correptorium fratris Thom&aelig;", an English <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Richard Clapwell (or Clapole), replied in a treatise "Contra corruptorium fratris Thomae". About the same time there appeared a work, which was afterwards printed at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1516) under the title, "Correctorium corruptorii S. Thomae", attributed by some to &AElig;gidius Romanus, by others to Clapwell, by others to Father <a href="08475b.htm">John of Paris</a>. St. Thomas was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> vindicated when the Council of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1311-12) defined, against Peter John Olivi, that the rational <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is the substantial form of the human body (on this definition see Zigliara, "De mente Conc. Vicnn.", Rome, 1878). The <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. Thomas by <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, in 1323, was a death-blow to his detractors. In 1324 Stephen de Bourret, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, revoked the censure pronounced by his predecessor, declaring that "that blessed confessor and excellent doctor, <a href="14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, had never believed, taught, or written anything contrary to the Faith or good <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>". It is <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether Tempier and his associates acted in the name of the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, which had always been loyal to St. Thomas. When this <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, in 1378, wrote a letter condemning the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of John de Montesono, it was explicitly declared that the condemnation was not aimed at St. Thomas: "We have said a thousand times, and yet, it would seem, not often enough, that we by no means include the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of St. Thomas in our condemnation." An account of these attacks and defences will be found in the following works: <a href="05270a.htm">Echard</a>, "Script. ord. prad.", I, 279 (Paris, 1719); De Rubeis, "Diss. crit.", Diss. xxv, xxvi, I, p. cclxviii; Leonine edit.

<h3 id="B">Progress of Thomism</h3>

<p>The general chapter of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, held at <a href="03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a> in 1342, declared that the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> had been received as sound and solid throughout the world (Douais, op. cit., 106). His works were consulted from the time they became known, and by the middle of the fourteenth century his "Summa Theologica" had supplanted the "Libri quatuor sententiarum", of <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> as the text-book of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. With the growth of the order and the widening of its influence Thomism spread throughout the world; St. Thomas became the great master in the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> and in the studia of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders (see Encyc. "Aeterni Patris" of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>). The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries saw Thomism in a triumphal march which led to the crowning of St. Thomas as the Prince of <a href="14580a.htm">Theologians</a>, when his "Summa was laid beside the <a href="../bible.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> at the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and <a href="12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, in 1567, proclaimed him a <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor of the Universal Church</a>. The publication of the "Piana" edition of his works, in 1570, and the multiplication of editions of the "Opera omnia" and of the "Summa" during the seventeenth century and part of the eighteenth show that Thomism flourished during that period. In fact it was during that period that some of the great commentators (for example, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Sylvius, and <a href="02567a.htm">Billuart</a>) adapted his works to the needs of the times.</p>

<h3 id="C">Decline of Scholasticism and of Thomism</h3>

<p>Gradually, however, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there came a decline in the study of the works of the great <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. Scholars believed that there was need of a new system of studies, and, instead of building upon and around <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, they drifted away from it. The chief causes which brought about the change were <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, the study of nature, and the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Positive <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> was considered more <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in discussions with the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> than <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> definitions and divisions. Elegance of diction was sought by the Humanists in the Greek and Latin classics, rather than in the works of the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, many of whom were far from being masters of style. The discoveries of <a href="04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> (d. 1543), Kepler (d. 1631), <a href="06342b.htm">Galileo</a> (d. 1642), and Newton (d. 1727) were not favourably received by the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. The experimental <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> were in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>; the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> including <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, were neglected (cf. Turner, op cit., 433). Finally, the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> disorganized all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, dealing to Thomisn a blow from which it did not fully recover until the last quarter of the nineteenth century. At the time when <a href="02567a.htm">Billuart</a> (d. 1757) published his "Summa Sancti Thoma hodiernis academiarum moribus accomodata" Thomism still held an important place in all <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussion. The tremendous upheaval which disturbed <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> from 1798 to 1815 affected the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as well as the State. The <a href="09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, which had been largely Thomistic, was compelled to close its doors, and other important institutions of learning were either closed or seriously hampered in their work. The <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, which naturally had supplied the most ardent Thomists, was crushed in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The province of <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> was almost destroyed, whilst the provinces of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> were left to struggle for their very existence. The <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="09597b.htm">Manila</a> (1645) continued to teach the doctrines of St. Thomas and in due time gave to the world Cardinal Zephyrinus Gonz&aacute;lez, O.P., who contributed in no small degree to the revival of Thomism under <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>.</p>

The principle of individuation, for material composites, is matter with its dimensions: without this there can be no merely numerical multiplication: distinction in the form makes specific distinction: hence there cannot be two <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> of the same species.</li><li>The essences of things do not depend on the <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, but on His <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and ultimately on His essence, which is immutable. The <a href="09076a.htm">natural law</a>, being derived from the eternal law, depends on the mind of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, ultimately on the essence of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; hence it is intrinsically immutable. Some actions are forbidden by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> because they are bad: they are not bad simply because He forbids them [see Zigliara, "Sum. phil." (3 vols., Paris, 1889), ccx, xi, II, M. 23, 24, 25].</li><li>The will moves the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> <em>quoad exercitium</em>, i.e. in its actual operation: the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> moves the will <em>quoad specificationem</em>, i.e. by presenting objects to it: <em>nil volitum nisi praecognitum</em>. The beginning of all our acts is the apprehension and desire of good in general (<em>bonum in communi</em>). We desire <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> (<em>bonum in communi</em>) naturally and necessarily, not by a free deliberate act. Particular goods (<em>bona particularia</em>) we choose freely; and the will is a blind faculty, always following the last practical judgment of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> (Zigliara, 51).</li><li>The senses and the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> are passive, i.e. recipient, faculties; they do not create, but receive (i.e. perceive) their objects (<a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, I, Q. lxxviii, a. 3; Q. lxxix, a. 2; Zigliara, 26, 27). If this principle is borne in mind there is no reason for <a href="08603a.htm">Kant's</a> "Critique of Pure Reason". On the other hand those faculties are not like wax, or the sensitive plate used by photographers, in the sense that they are inert and receive impressions unconsciously. The will controls the exercise of the faculties, and the process of acquiring <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a vital process: the moving cause is always within the living agent.</li><li>The Peripatetic axiom: "<em>Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius in sensu</em>" (Nothing is in the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> that was not first in the senses), is admitted; but St. Thomas modifies it by saying: first, that, once the sense objects have been perceived, the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> ascends to the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of higher things, even of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; and, secondly, that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> knows its own existence by itself (i.e. by its own act), although it knows its own nature only by reflection on its acts. Knowledge begins by sense perception, but the range of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> is far beyond that of the senses. In the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> as soon as it begins to act are found the first principles (<em>prima principia</em>) of all <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not in the form of an objective illumination, but in the form of a subjective inclination to admit them on account of their evidence. As soon as they are proposed we see that they are <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>; there is no more reason for doubting them than there is for denying the existence of the sun when we see it shining (see Zigliara, op. cit., pp. 32-42).</li><li>The direct and primary object of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> is the universal, which is prepared and presented to the passive <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> (<em>intellectus possibilis</em>) by the active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> (<em>intellectus agens</em>) which illuminates the phantasmata, or <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> images, received through the senses, and divests them of all individuating conditions. This is called abstracting the universal <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> from the phantasmata, but the term must not be taken in a materialistic sense. Abstraction is not a transferring of something from one place to another; the illumination causes all material and individuating conditions to disappear, then the universal alone shines out and is perceived by the vital action of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> (Q. lxxxiv, a. 4; Q. lxxxv, a. 1, ad lum, 3um, 4um). The process throughout is so vital, and so far elevated above material conditions and modes of action, that the nature of the acts and of the objects apprehended proves the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> to be immaterial and spiritual.</li><li>The <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, by its very nature, is <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Not only is it <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> will not annihilate the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, but from its very nature it will always continue to exist, there being in it no principle of disintegration (Zigliara, p. 9). Hence <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> can prove the incorruptibility (i.e. <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>) of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>.</li><li>The <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a> is not known by an innate <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, it cannot be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by arguments <em>a priori</em> or <em>a simultaneo</em>; but it can be demonstrated by <em>a posteriori</em> arguments. <a href="11257a.htm">Ontologism</a> was never taught by St. Thomas or by Thomists (see Lepidi, "Exam. phil. theol. de ontologismo", Louvain, 1874, c. 19; Zigliara, Theses I, VIII).</li><li>There are no human (i.e. deliberate) acts indifferent <em>in individuo</em>.</li></ul></div>

<p><em>(2) In Theology</em></p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Faith and <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, i.e. <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by demonstration, cannot co-exist in the same subject with regard to the same object (Zigliara, O, 32, VII); and the same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and opinion.</li><li>The metaphysical essence of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> consists, according to some Thomists, in the <em>intelligere actualissimum</em>, i.e. fulness of pure intellection, according to others in the perfection of <em>aseitas</em>, i.e. in dependent existence (Zigliara, Th. VIII, IX).</li><li>The <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, formally and in the ultimate analysis, consists in the vision, not in the fruition, of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>.</li><li>The <a href="02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> are distinguished from the Divine nature and from each other by a virtual distinction, i.e. by a <em>distinctio rationis cum fundamento a parte rei</em>. The <em>distinctio actualis formalis</em> of <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a> is rejected.</li><li>In attempting to explain the mystery of the Trinity &#151; in as far as man can conceive it &#151; the relations must be considered <em>perfectiones simpliciter simplices</em>, i.e. excluding all imperfection. The Holy Ghost would not be distinct from the Son if He did not proceed from the Son as well as from the Father.</li><li>The <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, being pure spirits, are not, properly speaking, in any place; they are said to be in the place, or in the places, where they exercise their activity (Summa, I, Q. lii, a. 1). Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> passing from place to place; but if an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> wishes to exercise its activity first in <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> and afterwards in America, it can do so in two instants (of <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> time), and need not pass through the intervening space (Q. liii). <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> does not discuss the question "How many <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> can dance on the point of a needle?" He reminds us that we must not think of <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> as if they were corporeal, and that, for an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a>, it makes no difference whether the sphere of his activity be the point of a needle or a continent (Q. lii, a. 2). Many <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> cannot be said to be in the same place at the same time, for this would mean that whilst one <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> is producing an effect others could be producing the same effect at the same time. There can be but one <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> in the same place at the same time (Q. lii, a. 3). The <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> comes through <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> (<em>species</em>) infused by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (QQ. lv, a.2, lvii, a.2, lviii, a.7). They do not naturally <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> future contingents, the secrets of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, or the mysteries of grace (Q. lvii, aa. 3, 45). The <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> choose either <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> instantly, and with full <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; hence their judgment is naturally final and irrevocable (Q. lxiv, a. 2).</li><li>Man was created in the state of <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Grace was not due to his nature, but <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> granted it to him from the beginning (I, Q. xcv, a. 1). So great was the perfection of man in the state of original <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, and so perfect the subjection of his lower faculties to the higher, that his first <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> could not have been <em>a venial</em> <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../summa/2089.htm#article3">I-II:89:3</a>).</li><li>It is more probable that the <a href="07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> would not have taken place had man not <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a> (III, Q. i, a. 3). In Christ there were three kinds of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: the <em>scientia beata</em>, i.e. the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things in the Divine Essence; the <em>scientia infusa</em>, i.e. the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things through infused <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> (<em>species</em>), and the <em>scientia acquisita</em>, i.e. acquired or experimental <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which was nothing more than the actual experience of things which he already <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a>. On this last point St. Thomas, in the "Summa" (Q. ix, a. 4), explicitly retracts an opinion which he had once held (III Sent., d. 14, Q. iii, a. 3).</li><li>All <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the New Law, including confirmation and extreme unction, were instituted immediately by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Circumcision was a sacrament of the <a href="10582c.htm">Old Law</a> and conferred grace which removed the stain of <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>. The children of <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> or of other unbelievers may not be <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> without the consent of their <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> (III, Q. lxviii, a. 10; II-II, Q. x, a. 12; <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, n. 1481). Contrition, confession, and satisfaction are the proximate matter (<em>materia proxima</em>) of the <a href="11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. Thomists hold, against the <a href="13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, that when <a href="05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> takes place in the Mass the Body of Christ is not made present <em>per modum adduclionis</em>, i.e. is not brought to the altar, but they do not agree in selecting the term which should be used to express this action (cf. <a href="02567a.htm">Billuart</a>, "De Euchar.", Diss. i, a. 7). Cardinal Billot holds ("De eccl. sacr.", Rome, 1900, Th. XI, "De euchar.", p. 379) that the best, and the only possible, explanation is the one given by St. Thomas himself: Christ becomes present by <a href="05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a>, i.e. by the conversion of the substance of bread into the substance of His body (III, Q. lxxv, a. 4; Sent., d. XI, Q. i, a. 1, q. 1). After the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> the accidents (<em>accidentia</em>) of the <a href="01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="01358a.htm">wine</a> are preserved by <a href="06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> without a subject (Q. lxxxvii, a. 1). It was on this question that the <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> sought enlightenment from St. Thomas (see Vaughan, "Life and Labours of St. Thomas", London, 1872, II, p. 544). The earlier Thomists, following St. Thomas (Suppl., Q. xxxvii, a. 2), taught that the sub-diaconate and the four <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a> were partial <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Some recent Thomists &#151; e.g., Billot (op. cit., p. 282) and Tanquerey (De ordine, n. 16) &#151; defend this opinion as more probable and more in conformity with the definitions of the councils. The giving of the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> with wine and of the <a href="11541b.htm">paten</a> with bread Thomists generally held to be an essential part of <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Some, however, taught that the <a href="07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> was at least <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. On the question of <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> under the <a href="10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> the disciples of St. Thomas, like the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> himself (Suppl., Q. lxvii, a. 3), wavered, some holding that a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> was granted, others teaching that <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> was merely tolerated in order to avoid greater evils.</li></ul></div>

<h2 id="ii">The Thomistic school</h2>

<p>The chief doctrines distinctive of this school, composed principally of Dominican writers, are the following:</p>

<h3 id="A">In philosophy</h3>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>The unity of substantial form in composite beings, applied to man, requires that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> be the substantial form of the man, so as to exclude even the <em>forma corporeitatis</em>, admitted by <a href="07235b.htm">Henry of Ghent</a>, <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, and others (cf. Zigliara, P. 13; <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, in note to n. 1655).</li><li>In created beings there is a real distinction between the <em>essentia</em> (essence) and the <em>existentia</em> (existence); between the <em>essentia</em> and the <em>subsistentia</em>; between the real relation and its foundation; between the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and its faculties; between the several faculties. There can be no medium between a <em>distinctio realis</em> and a <em>distinctio rationis</em>, or conceptual distinction; hence the <em>distinctio formalis a parte rei</em> of <a href="05194a.htm">Scotus</a> cannot be admitted. For Thomistic doctrines on <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>, <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, etc., see below.</li></ol></div>

<h3 id="B">In theology</h3>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>In the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> essence takes the place not only of the <em>species impressa</em>, but also of the <em>species expressa</em>.</li><li>All moral virtues, the acquired as well as the infused, in their perfect state, are interconnected.</li><li>According to <a href="02567a.htm">Billuart</a> (De pecc., diss. vii, a. 6), it has been a matter of controversy between Thomists whether the malice of a mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is absolutely <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>.</li><li>In choosing a medium between Rigorism and Laxism, the Thomistic <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> has been Antiprobabilistic and generally has adopted Probabiliorism. Some defended Equiprobabilism, or <a href="12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> <em>cum compensatione</em>. Medina and <a href="01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> are claimed by the Probabilists.</li><li>Thomistic <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> generally, whilst they defended the <a href="07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the Roman pontiff</a>, denied that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had the power to dissolve a <em>matrimonium ratum</em> or to dispense from a solemn <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> made to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. When it was urged that some <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> had granted such favours, they cited other pontiffs who declared that they could not grant them (cf. <a href="02567a.htm">Billuart</a>, "De matrim.", Diss. v, a. 2), and said, with <a href="14152a.htm">Dominic Soto</a>, "Factum pontificium non facit articulum fidei" (The action of a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> does not constitute an <a href="01755d.htm">article of faith</a>, in 4 dist., 27, Q. i, a. 4). Thomists of today are of a different mind, owing to the practice of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</li><li>The <a href="07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a>, without any additional grace, rendered Christ impeccable. The Word was <a href="07610b.htm">hypostatically united</a> to the blood of Christ and remained united to it, even during the interval between His death and <a href="12789a.htm">resurrection</a> (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, n. 718). During that same interval the Body of Christ had a transitory form, called <em>forma cadaverica</em> (Zigliara, P. 16, 17, IV).</li><li>The <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the New Law cause grace not only as instrumental moral causes, but by a mode of <a href="03459a.htm">causality</a> which should be called instrumental and physical. In the attrition required in the <a href="11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> there should be at least a beginning of the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; sorrow for <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> springing solely from the fear of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> will not suffice.</li><li>Many <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the Thomistic School, especially before the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, opposed the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Mary's Immaculate Conception, claiming that in this they were following <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. This, however, has not been the opinion either of the entire <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> or of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> as a body. Father Rouard de Card, in his book "L'ordre des freres precheurs et l'Immacul&eacute;e Conception "(Brussels, 1864), called attention to the fact that ten thousand professors of the order defended Mary's great privilege. At the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> twenty-five <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed a petition for the definition of the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Thousands of <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, in taking degrees at the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, solemnly pledged themselves to defend the Immaculate Conception.</li><li>The Thomistic School is distinguished from other <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> chiefly by its doctrines on the difficult questions relating to <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> action on the <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a> of man, <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge, grace, and <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a>. In the articles on these subjects will be found an exposition of the different theories advanced by the different <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in their effort to explain these mysteries, for such they are in reality. As to the value of these theories the following points should be borne in mind:</li> <ul><li>No theory has as yet been proposed which avoids all difficulties and solves all <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a>;</li><li>on the main and most difficult of these questions some who are at times listed as <a href="10437a.htm">Molinists</a> &#151; notably <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Francis de Lugo, and, in our own days, Cardinal Billot ("De deo uno et trino", Rome, 1902, Th. XXXII) &#151; agree with the Thomists in defending <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a> <em>ante praevisa merita</em>. <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, after a long study of the question of physical premotion, adapted the Thomistic opinion ("Du libre arbitre", c. viii).</li><li>Thomists do not claim to be able to explain, except by a general reference to <a href="11251c.htm">God's omnipotence</a>, how man remains free under the action of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, which they consider <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to preserve and explain the universality of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="03459a.htm">causality</a> and the independent <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> of His foreknowledge. No man can explain, except by a reference to <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, how the world was created out of nothing, yet we do not on this account deny creation, for we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that it must be admitted. In like manner the main question put to Thomists in this controversy should be not "How will you explain man's liberty?" but "What are your reasons for claiming so much for <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> action?" If the reasons assigned are insufficient, then one great difficulty is removed, but there remains to be solved the problem of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> foreknowledge of man's free acts. If they are valid, then we must accept them with their <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequences and humbly confess our inability fully to explain how wisdom "reacheth . . . from end to end mightily, and ordereth all things sweetly" (<a href="../bible/wis008.htm#vrs1">Wisdom 8:1</a>).</li><li>Most important of all, it must be clearly understood and remembered that the Thomistic system on <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a> neither saves fewer nor sends to perdition more <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> than any other system held by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>. In regard to the number of the <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> there is no unanimity on either side; this is not the question in dispute between the <a href="10437a.htm">Molinists</a> and the Thomists. The discussions, too often animated and needlessly sharp, turned on this point: How does it happen that, although <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> sincerely desires the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all men, some are to be saved, and must thank <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for whatever merits they may have amassed, whilst others will be lost, and will <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that they themselves, and not <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, are to be blamed? &#151; The facts in the case are admitted by all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>. The Thomists, appealing to the authority of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and St. Thomas, defend a system which follows the admitted facts to their <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> conclusions. The <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> are saved by the <a href="06689a.htm">grace of God</a>, which operates on their wills efficaciously and infallibly without detriment to their liberty; and since <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> sincerely desires the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all men, He is prepared to grant that same grace to others, if they do not, by a <a href="06259a.htm">free</a> <a href="01115a.htm">act</a>, render themselves unworthy of it. The faculty of placing obstacles to <a href="06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> is the unhappy faculty of <a href="14004b.htm">sinning</a>; and the existence of moral <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> in the world is a problem to be solved by all, not by the Thomists alone. The fundamental difficulties in this mysterious question are the existence of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> and the non-salvation of some, be they few or be they many, under the rule of an <a href="11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, all-wise, and all-merciful <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and they miss the point of the controversy who suppose that these difficulties exist only for the Thomists. The <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> is known to lie somewhere between <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> and <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> on the one hand, and Semipelagianism on the other. The efforts made by <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> and the various explanations offered by Augustinians, Thomists, <a href="10437a.htm">Molinists</a>, and Congruists show how difficult of solution are the questions involved. Perhaps we shall never <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>, in this world, how a just and merciful <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> provides in some special manner for the <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> and yet sincerely loves all men. The celebrated <em><a href="04238a.htm">Congregatio de Auxiliis</a></em> did not forever put an end to the controversies, and the question is not yet settled.</li></ul></ol></div>

<h2 id="iii">Neo-Thomism and the revival of Scholasticism</h2>

<p>When the world in the first part of the nineteenth century began to enjoy a period of peace and rest after the disturbances caused by the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and the Napoleonic Wars, closer attention was given to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies and <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> was revived. This movement eventually caused a revival of Thomism, because the great master and model proposed by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in the encyclical "Aeterni Patris" (4 Aug., 1879) was <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. . . . The Thomistic <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> had received strong support from the older <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>. Among these the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Aeterni Patris" mentions <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Salamanca, Alcal&aacute; <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a>, <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="11385b.htm">Padua</a>, Bologna, <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and Coimbra as "the homes of human wisdom where Thomas reigned supreme, and the minds of all, teachers as well as taught, rested in wonderful harmony under the shield and authority of the <a href="14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a>". In the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> established by the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at <a href="09255a.htm">Lima</a> (1551) and Manila (1645) <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> always held sway. The same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of the Minerva <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1255), which ranked as a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> from the year 1580, and is now the international Collegio Angelico. Coming down to our own times and the results of the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, which gave a new impetus to the study of St. Thomas's works, the most important centres of activity are <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, Fribourg (Switzerland), and Washington. At <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> the chair of Thomistic philosophy, established in 1880, became, in 1889-90, the "Institut sup&eacute;rieur de philosophie" or "Ecole St. Thomas d'Aquin," where Professor Mercier, now <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, ably and wisely directed the new Thomistic movement (see De Wulf, "Scholasticism Old and New", tr. Coffey, New York, 1907, append., p. 261; "Irish Ecel. Record", Jan. 1906). The <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> department of the <a href="06302a.htm">University of Fribourg</a>, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, established in 1889, has been entrusted to the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. By the publication of the "Revue thomiste" the professors of that <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> have contributed greatly to a new <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and appreciation of St. Thomas. The Constitution of the <a href="03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a> at Washington enjoins special veneration for St. Thomas; the School of Sacred Sciences must follow his leadership ("Const. Cath. Univ. Amer.", Rome, 1889, pp. 38, 43). The <a href="11352b.htm">University of Ottawa</a> and <a href="09047b.htm">Laval University</a> are the centres of Thomism in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The appreciation of St. Thomas in our days, in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and in America, is well set forth in Perrier's excellent "Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century" (New York, 1909).</p>

<h2 id="iv">Eminent Thomists</h2>

<p>After the middle of the fourteenth century the vast majority of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writers either wrote commentaries on the works of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> or based their teachings on his writings. It is impossible, therefore, to give here a complete list of the Thomists: only the more important names can be given. Unless otherwise noted, the authors belonged to the <a href="12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>. Those marked (*) were devoted to Thomism in general, but were not of the Thomistic School.
