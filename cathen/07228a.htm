<p>German King and Roman Emperor, son of Conrad II; b. 1017; d. at Bodfeld, in the Harz Mountains, 5 Oct., 1056.</p>

<p>It was to his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> forceful <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> that he owed the resources by means of which he could maintain for himself the great and powerful position which Conrad had created. Of course this position was no longer an undisputed one, especially towards the end of his reign. On the contrary it became evident by that time that through his rule <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> had reached the critical turning-point in her history. The key to the domestic and foreign policy of this emperor can be found altogether in his character. Henry was extraordinarily gifted, having a quick <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> and many-sided interests. Consequently he rapidly mastered the problems of administration and government into which his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> had him initiated; but with equal rapidity he acquired the literary and artistic culture of his time which his episcopal tutors imparted to him. His profound <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and the serious, austere bent of his nature were still more important factors in his character. Putting the garment of the penitent on the same plane as the regalia of the king, he lived and moved altogether according to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> view of life. The <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> moral law regulated his actions. In this conception of life his stern sense of <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> had its roots, and to this sense of <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> was added a stubborn self-reliance. With such spiritual tendencies it is not surprising to learn that the king frequently subjected his frail body to severe penitential exercises, and that his private life bore a marked resemblance in many points to that of a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>. But at the same time it is not surprising to learn that such a man was reserved, that consequently, though a man of the utmost <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a>, he remained a stranger to the spirit of his people. This basic trait of his character imparted to both his domestic and foreign policy idealistic aims which frequently disregard facts, or for that matter were even outside of the necessities of the State. According to his conception his kingship was religious in character. Like the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he considered himself called to the service of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Like <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> of old, he compared himself to the priest-king <a href="04642b.htm">David</a>. He desired to be the ruler of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> universal State which should constitute the outward and visible form for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The goodly object of his ecumenic imperialism, therefore, was to carry out the moral <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>With this fundamental <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> as a starting-point, it was but natural that Henry should recognize the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as the arbiter of his <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>. At the very beginning of his reign the king announced that he recognized the fundamental principle of this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>; that a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> could only be judged by the <a href="04447a.htm">ecclesiastical tribunals</a>. He bitterly lamented his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> behaviour towards the <a href="02581b.htm">princes of the Church</a> in <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. He considered the deposing of Aribert of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> uncanonical. In general it soon became apparent that Henry was resolved to make religious <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> once more the determining factors in the art of government. This renewed triumph of religious <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> was straightway demonstrated at the synod of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> in 1043. There the king, clad in the garment of the penitent, preached the peace of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to the awe-struck masses from the high <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a>. Henceforth this serious <a href="04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> spirit was predominant in all the imperial entourage. Minstrels and tumblers vanished from the court.</p>

<p>The king was still more confirmed in his austere conception of life by his second wife, Agnes of Poitou, daughter of the Duke of Aquitaine, who likewise had been brought up according to the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Cluny. (Henry's first wife, the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> princess Gunhild, died in 1038.) This attitude of the king towards the world accounts for the leniency and indulgence that characterized his domestic and foreign policy and it determined absolutely his conduct in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> politics. At the beginning of his reign it looked as if the imperial authority were still increasing. In the East, success attended his arms. The aggressive <a href="14042a.htm">Slavic</a> policy of Duke Bretislaw of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> was checked in 1041. After that, <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> was for a long time a support of the German king. <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> also became a tributary vassal. It is due to these successes that Henry's reign is so generally considered the zenith of German history. Not altogether correctly. His leniency and indulgence fostered an opposition, especially in the interior, which he was destined never completely to overcome. This decline of his commanding position within the empire took place while the king was trying to discharge the supreme <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of his high office as priest-king.</p>

<p>Henry's ideal was the purity of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Only a church that was immaculate might and could be a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> helpmeet to him in the kingship. He himself was never party to any act of <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>. But as presumptive priest-king, he held inflexibly to the right of investiture. As such he also presided over the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>; as such he also passed sentence in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. He did not realize that this involved a striking contradiction. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, pure and morally regenerate in the spirit of the reform party, could not fail to resist imperial domination. This <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> on the part of the king resulted in the rapid rise of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the slow decline of the imperial power in its fight for its old <a href="12437a.htm">ecclesiastical privileges</a>. In the first period of Henry's reign, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> saw the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> of three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>: <a href="02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a>, Sylvester III, and <a href="06791a.htm">Gregory VI</a>. Although of spotless character, <a href="06791a.htm">Gregory</a> had bought the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a> from the unprincipled Benedict. Perhaps he had recourse to <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> as an expedient to secure the supremacy of the reform party, perhaps also merely in order to get the <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> Benedict out of the way. Henry, however would consent to accept the emperor's crown only from hands that were pure, while those of the <em>de facto</em> <a href="06791a.htm">Pope Gregory</a> seemed to him tainted with <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>. All three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> were repudiated by the Synod of Sutri on 20 December, 1046. This synod revealed Henry's attitude towards the canon law. He <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> that according to this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> no one can sit in judgment on a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Therefore the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was not deposed by that synod, which, on the contrary, demanded that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> himself pronounce the judgment. He went into exile in <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, accompanied by <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, who was soon to reveal the power of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The German <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, supported by the power of the German emperors, were now able to elevate their holy office above the partisan strife of the turbulent factions of the Roman nobility, and above the desperate moral barbarism of the age. Under Suidger of <a href="02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, who called himself <a href="04017a.htm">Clement II</a>, Henry still asserted his claim to the right of the Roman patriciate, that of control over the nominations to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. But under <a href="09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> the emancipation of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> from the imperial authority already began to manifest itself.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Freed at last from the narrow local Roman policy, the universal point of view once more dictated the conduct of the <a href="12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a>. Immediately a great wave of reform also set in, directed first and foremost against <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> and the marriage of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. The restless and ubiquitous energy of Leo was also turned against the overweening assertions of independence on the part of the episcopal potentates on both sides of the Alps. At the same time, however, the same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> pointed the way to his successors, even for their temporal policy in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He was the first to demonstrate the importance of Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> policy. Of course his own plans in that part of the country were wrecked by the Normans.</p>

<p>Henry's <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy, therefore, had not only helped the reform party to victory but also led to the triumph of the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the supremacy of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, which was inseparably connected with it. The preparatory scenes of the great drama of the following epoch were over. At the same time new forces sprang up in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>: the cities and the petty lay nobility. Marked disaffection prevailed, especially among the latter. Of course Henry was still quite strong enough to subdue these rising powers. But for how long? It was already extremely ominous that Henry did not retain in his own hands the escheated Duchies of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Swabia, and Carinthia. His failure to do so must needs bring its revenge, for the new dukes were unreliable men. The dissatisfaction was especially clamorous in <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. Here the people took offence at the relations between the emperor and the strenuous <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, who sought to create a great northern <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, but also strove to build up a strong temporal foundation for his <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a>.</p>

<p>In the natural course of events this brought him into conflict with the lay nobility. While the king was carrying on futile military operations in the year 1051 and later, against the Hungarians, who were trying to throw off the suzerainty of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the discontent in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> came to a head in the revolt of <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>. This revolt, which was repeated several times, assumed dangerous proportions through the marriage of Duke Godfrey of Lorraine with Beatrice, <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of the Margrave Boniface of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, who was master of an important and commanding position in Upper and Central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Henry endeavoured to break up this threatening coalition by means of a journey to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1055. But Godfrey instigated a fresh insurrection in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. A movement in opposition to the king in Southern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> attained alarming dimensions. Henry, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, deposed the rebellious dukes, Conrad of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and <a href="07056c.htm">Guelph</a> of Carinthia. But Duke Conrad stirred up the Hungarians and destroyed the last vestiges of German prestige in that country. The death of both the South German dukes in the interim soon led to the overthrow of the Duke of Lorraine. It was in these domestic troubles that the disastrous results of the emperor's leniency and indulgence were to appear most clearly and fully. Unbroken now was the opposition to the Crown in <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and Southern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, unweakened the dangerous alliance of <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> and <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> in the South, unimpaired the growing power of the Normans, while the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> grew without hindrance. All the forces with which the <a href="07230a.htm">fourth Henry</a> had to cope were in the field, ready for action, at Henry III's death.</p>
