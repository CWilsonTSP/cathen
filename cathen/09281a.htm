<h1>Patriarchate of Lisbon</h1>

<p>Patriarchate of Lisbon (Lisbonensis).</p>

<p>Includes the districts of Lisbon and <a href="13459c.htm">Santarem</a>. The area of the district of Lisbon is 3065 sq. miles; pop. 709,509 (1900). Area of <a href="13459c.htm">Santarem</a> 2,555 sq. miles; pop. 283,154.</p>

<p>Lisbon is said to owe its origin to Ulysses, and hence its oldest name Ulisaypo or Olissipo, which became on Ph&aelig;necian lips Alisubbo, meaning the "friendly bay". Its charm was acknowledged by the Romans in the name they gave it, <em>Felicitas Julia;</em> and when the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> came they changed it back to Al Aschbuna, a variant of the Po&oelig;nician title. From Alisubbo and Al Aschbuna we have the later name Lissabona, whence the modern Portuguese Lisboa and the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> Lisbon. It lies on the north bank of the Tagus, 12 miles from the open sea, clustered around seven hills that rise above one another, ending in the Serra of Cintra.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The town was taken by the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> in 716 and remained in their possession until 1145, when Alfonso Henriques with the assistance of an army of <a href="04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>, English, Normans and Flemings bound for the Holy Land, drove out the invaders, and removed the capital of the country from Coimbra to Lisbon. An <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> named Gilbert who was with the expedition was chosen <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lisbon at this time. On two occasions the city suffered from disastrous earthquakes; in 1531 more than 1500 houses were destroyed, besides many <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and palaces. On 1 Novembner, 1755, a second disastrous earthquake shook the city and more than 30,000 of the inhabitants perished. To add to the misery, a fire broke out which lasted four days. Carvalho, <a href="16075a.htm">Marquis of Pombal</a>, at that time Minister of War, took charge of the panic-stricken city, and having extinguished the flames, drew up plans for the rebuilding of Lisbon. A bronze equestrian <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of King Jos&eacute; with a medallion of <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal</a>, was erected in the new Pra&#231;a do Commercio to commemorate the rebuilding. Except in this new quarter, around the Pra&#231;a do Commercio, the streets of Lisbon are irregular and steep, but there is an elaborate electric trolley sylstem connecting all parts of the town, and the <em>ascensores</em> or giant lifts help to overcome the difficulties of high and low levels. There are fountains everywhere and the streets are lined by trees, of which the olaia or judas-tree is the most common. The oldest portion of Lisbon is along the steep slopes of the Castello de S. Jorge, which had been the stronghold of the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a>. In the neighbourhood of the Cathedral or S&eacute;, Roman remains have been found including the ruins of a Roman Theatre. The S&eacute; or Cathedral of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> is the oldest church in Lisbon; it dates back to the year 306. It served as a mosque for the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> during their occupation of the city, and the fa&#231;ade with its towers and massive portico was rebuilt during the fourteenth century. It has been restored many times.</p>

<p>Outside what were the old walls of Lisbon stands the church of S. Vincente da Fora (St. Vincent's without) with a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> attached, which is now the residence of the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Lisbon. The church contains the mortuary <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Kings of the House of Braganza, and the great constable Nuno. Alvara Pariera lies buried here. St. Vincent is the <a href="11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of Lisbon; he was <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> for the Faith under <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. According to the legend, his body was attached to a millstone and flung into the sea (336), but was <a href="10338a.htm">miraculously</a> discovered on the sands at Valencia by some <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of that place. In the eighth century the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> took Valencia, and the inhabitants fled by sea, taking the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Vincent with them. They were driven ashore on the coast of Algarve at the cape now known as Cape St. Vincent, and there they remained until D. Alfonso Henriques had expelled the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> from Lisbon, when they were brought from Cape Saint Vincent and deposited in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> he had just built. At this same time Alfonso began the building of the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Alcobaca, in fulfilment of a <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> he had made to build a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard's</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, if he were successful in his <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a>. The Castello of S. Jorge was built in the time of Julius C&aelig;sar, and strengthened by the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a>, who held out there against the assault of Alfonso Henriques. It had three towers, known as Ulysses, Albarram, and Managem, but every trace of them disappeared in the earthquake of 1755. It was the royal residence until the Spanish kings of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> chose the famous Paco do Terriero which was ruined in 1755. Don Jo&#227;o I made <a href="06453a.htm">St. George</a> its <a href="11562a.htm">patron saint</a>; he had married an English princess, Philippa, daughter of John of Gaunt. The procession on the feast of <a href="04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> from the Castello to the church of S. Domingo was a brilliant one in former years. St. George, lance in hand and on horseback in heavy armour, was personated by one of the faithful and his standard was borne before him by another rider. King and court all took part in this procession, the patriarch carrying the sacred Host.</p>

<h2>The modern city</h2>

<p>The <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Roque looks onto a square of its own name; it contains the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. John the Baptist, built in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from designs by the architect Vaneteli. Its costly marbles and <a href="10584a.htm">mosaic</a> reproductions of <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, <a href="12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, and <a href="03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> took ten years to complete. Close by is the <em>Casa de Unisencordia,</em> a <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> and an <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. Near at hand is the Graca church and <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> (now a barracks) facing the city. The church contains a remarkable crucifix known as Nosser Senhor dos Passos da Graca. The church of the Carmo, a beautiful relic of Portuguese Gothic, is now a museum. Belem, a suburb of Lisbon, contains the church and <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a>, known locally as the Jeronymos. The old name of Belem was Restello, and it was from here that <a href="06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a> set out to discover a sea route to <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>. A <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> had been built on the spot by Prince Henry the Navigator, and to it king and court went in procession, 8 July, 1497. On that same day <a href="06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a> embarked; he returned in September, 1499, having rounded the Cape of Good Hope. To immortalize the event King Manuel built a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Prince Henry's <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, changed the name of the locality from Restello to Belem or Bethlehem, and gave the new building to the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>; hence the name Jeronymos. The first stone was laid in 1500. The building is of white stone from the quarries of Estramadura, and the foundations were laid on piles of pinewood. The style of architecture is pure Manueline (a mixture of Gothic, <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and <a href="10424a.htm">Moorish</a>) and the doorway is exuberantly decorated. The church is fast becoming a mausoleum of celebrated men. It contains the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a>, of Cam&#245;es, the great poet, and of Almeida Garrett, the chief Portuguese poet of the nineteenth century. In the <a href="03584a.htm">chapter house</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> is the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Alexandro Herculano, greatest of Portuguese historians. The columned arches of the <a href="04060a.htm">cloisters</a> are decorated with the twisted cable moulding so common in Manueline buildings. High above Belem stands the Ajuda Palace, built early in the nineteenth century to replace the royal palace which had been destroyed by the earthquake of 1755. It is a conspicuous edifice and is one of the first seen on entering the port of Lisbon. The actual residence of the royal family is the Palace of the Necessidades. Since 1834 the Cortes, a generic designation for the Constitutional Chambers of peers and deputies, occupies the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Bento. The actual number of deputies is 148, elected by the people, whereas the chamber of peers consists of nominated members appointed by the crown, and none of them under 40 years of age. One of the most remarkable monuments connected with the city is the Acueducto das Aguas Livras (built in 1713), which reaches a distance of ten miles to Chellos.</p>

<p>Near the Estrella Gardens is a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cemetery containing the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Henry Fielding, the English novelist, who died in Lisbon in 1754. This part of the city also contains the Basilica of the SS. Cor&#227;cao de Jesus with its commanding <a href="04569d.htm">cupola</a> of white marble. The old <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> has been turned into a museum of <a href="05248a.htm">fine arts</a>; and a portion of the building contains the National Library of Lisbon, where are stored about 300,000 volumes, besides many rare <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The first book printed by Guttenberg is shown there, and a Bible from the same press. It also contains books from the Duke of Northumberland's <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> brought to Lisbon when the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Sion were driven out of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> during the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The largest church in Lisbon is S. Domingo in the Pra&#231;a do Rocio. It was dedicated in 1241, and has undergone many changes. The kings of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> are usually married there, and it was the former church of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. In 1761 it witnessed the <em>auto da f&eacute;</em> of <a href="09565c.htm">Father Malagrida</a> the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, who was falsely accused of complicity in a plot against <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal's</a> life.</p>

<p>Except around the Pra&#231;a do Commercio, nearly all the important buildings of Lisbon are or have been churches and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Since their suppression, 28 May, 1834, the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> have been mainly used as barracks. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> is the State religion, but all other forms of worship are tolerated, and in government circles the feeling is anti-clerical if not anti-religious. The press is represented by two able journals, the "Diario dos Noticias" and "O Seculo". The population of Lisbon in 1900 was computed at 357,000. The present King of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> is Manuel II, born 15 November, 1889, who succeeded to the throne on the assassination of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> and elder brother 1 February, 1908. The reigning dynasty belongs to the House of Braganza-Coburg; John IV of Braganza having expelled the Spanish from Lisbon in 1640, and Maria II of Braganza, having married Fernando, Prince of Coburg-Gotha, in the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The Avenida da Libertade is one of the new boulevards. It begins at the Pra&#231;ado Restoradores, which commemorates <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal's</a> Independence Day, 1 Dec., 1640, when the Duke of Braganza freed the land from Spanish domination. The avenue is lined with trees and subtropical plants and is divided by flower-beds and rockeries into three arteries to facilitate traffic. Twenty years ago all this district did not exist, and as in the newer quarters in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, there has been some overbuilding. Behind the Avenida lie the Botanical Gardens with their leafy lanes and wealth of tropical vegetation. The Pra&#231;a do Principe Real, a few minutes' walk from the gardens, stands on the site of the S&eacute; Patriarchal, built by Jo&#227;o V (1706-1750), as the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Western Lisbon, and destroyed by fire during the great earthquake. The port of Lisbon, one of the safest and most commodious roadsteads in the world, is annually entered and cleared by an average of 6000 vessels sailing under every flag. The chief manufactures of the neighbourhood are pottery, woollens, glass, preserved food, and fish. The wine trade of Lisbon is also important. Besides the public buildings referred to, the Academia Real, the Escola Polytechnica (580 pupils), and the Escola Medico-Cirurgica (224 pupils), as well as the observatory, deserve mention. Lisbon has also a military <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> (339 students), a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="05248a.htm">fine arts</a> (69 students), and a Conservatorio (503 students). Lisbon was occupied by the French in 1807, but the English took it in 1808 and made it a centre of operations against <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> during the Peninsular War.</p>

<h2>Ecclesiastical history</h2>

<p>The See of Lisbon dates from early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> times, and tradition has enshrined the names of its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> as far back as the sub-Apostolic epoch. It seems certain that a St. Potamius, who took part in the <a href="13057b.htm">Council of Rimini</a> (356), was <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lisbon. Other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are mentioned up to the year 716 when Lisbon passed into the hands of the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> and the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> remained vacant till 1147. Before the <a href="10424a.htm">Moorish</a> conquest the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suffragan of <a href="10202a.htm">M&eacute;rida</a>; the liberation under Alfonso I took place in 1147, and in 1199 Lisbon was made suffragan of <a href="04187b.htm">Compostela</a>. At the request of King John I, <a href="02670a.htm">Pope Boniface IX</a>, by <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 10 November, 1394, erected Lisbon into an archdiocese and gave it as suffragans, <a href="04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, Leiria, <a href="07049a.htm">Guarda</a>, <a href="05670a.htm">Evora</a>, and Silves (in 1396, however, <a href="05670a.htm">Evora</a> was detached by the same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>) and the first <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was John Anes. Among his more famous successors were Roderiguez da Cunha (1636) and Cardinal Luiz da Souza (1676). As <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> grew in political importance and colonial possessions, the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Lisbon expanded, and we learn from Stadel, "Compend. Geogr. Eccles." (1712) that Coimbra, Leiria, <a href="12283c.htm">Portalegre</a>, Elvas, <a href="06318c.htm">Funchal</a>, <a href="01513c.htm">Angra</a>, <a href="04228a.htm">Congo</a>, St. James of Cape Verde, San Thom&eacute;, and Baia of All Saints were suffragans of Lisbon. As a reward for assistance against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>, <a href="04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> in 1708 raised the Chapel of the Royal Palace to Collegiate rank and associated with it three <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Braganza and <a href="08761b.htm">Lamego</a>. Later in that same year, yielding to the request of John V, he issued the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In Supremo Apostolatus Solio" (22 Oct., 1716), known as the Golden <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, because the seal or bulla was affixed with gold instead of lead, giving the collegiate <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> rank, with metropolitical <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, and conferring on its titular the rank of patriarch. The town of Lisbon was ecclesiastically divided into Eastern and Western Lisbon. The former <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Lisbon retained <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Eastern Lisbon, and had as suffragans Guarda, <a href="12283c.htm">Portalegre</a>, St. James of Cape Verde, San Thom&eacute;, and San Salvator in <a href="04228a.htm">Congo</a>. Western Lisbon and metropolitical <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> over Leiria, <a href="08761b.htm">Lamego</a>, <a href="06318c.htm">Funchal</a>, and Angra, together with elaborate privileges and honours were granted to the new patriarch and his successors. It was further agreed between <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and king that the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Lisbon should be made a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> at the first consistory following his appointment. The first <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Lisbon was a saintly man, Thomas d'Almeyda, formerly <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Porto, and he was raised to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> 20 Dec., 1737. There thus existed side by side in the city of Lisbon two metropolitical churches. To obviate the inconvenience of this arrangement <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (13 Dec., 1740) united East and West Lisbon into one single archdiocese under Patriarch d'Almeyda, who ruled the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> until 1754. The double chapter however remained until 1843, when the old <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was dissolved by <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. It was during the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Cardinal d'Almeyda (1746) that the famous <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="13355a.htm">Saint John</a> the Baptist, now in the church of S&#227;o Roque, was built in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the expense of King John V, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a>.</p>

<p>At what date the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Lisbon began to quarter the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a> with three crowns, though without the keys, on their <a href="07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> is uncertain and there are no documents referring to the grant of such a privilege. By <a href="01640a.htm">Apostolic letters</a> <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 30 Sept., 1881 the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of Lisbon claims as suffragans the Dioceses of <a href="01512b.htm">Angola</a>, St. James of Cape Verde, San Thom&eacute;, Egitan, <a href="12283c.htm">Portalegre</a>, <a href="01513c.htm">Angra</a>, Funchal. The archdiocese comprises the civil districts of Lisbon and Santarem, and has a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 728,739. The estimated number of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> is 5000. The total number of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> is 341, of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> 662, and of <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> 1555. The present patriarch is Antonio Mendes Bello, who was born at Gouvea in the <a href="07049a.htm">Diocese of Guarda</a> in June, 1842, appointed <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10407a.htm">Mitylene</a> 24 March, 1884, translated to Faro 13 Nov., 1884, and appointed patriarch of Lisbon, 19 Dec., 1907, in succession to Cardinal Neto, who resigned. The patriarch is assisted by an <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, Mgr. Jos&eacute; Alves de Mattos, titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10407a.htm">Mitylene</a>. Cardinal Neto, the ex-patriarch, was born at Lagos in the <a href="05789a.htm">Diocese of Faro</a>, 8 Feb., 1841; was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1863; joined the <a href="06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a> in 1875; was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01512b.htm">Angola and Congo</a> in 1879; became <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Lisbon in 1883; was named <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of the Title of the <a href="01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>, 24 March, 1884, and at present ranks as senior <a href="03333b.htm#p">cardinal priest</a>. He resigned his <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> in November, 1907, and retired to a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of his own order in Lisbon. In 1624 a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> for English students desiring to study for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and for mission work in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, was founded in Lisbon by Pietro Catinho, a member of an illustrious <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. It is known as SS. Peter and Paul's and has the same <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges as the English College, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It suffered severely from the earthquake of 1755, but continues its work to this day, and is now governed by Monsignor Hilton, who was born in 1825; <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at Lisbon; <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> 1850; served some time on the mission in the <a href="13759c.htm">Diocese of Shrewsbury</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; made a domestic <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> in 1881; and returned to Lisbon as president in 1883. A college for <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students was founded by royal charter in 1593; it escaped all injury from the earthquake, but was closed during the civil <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> in <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> in the nineteenth century and has never been reopened. A <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and another of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> exist in Lisbon to this day.</p>

<h2>Santarem</h2>

<p>The ancient Scalabis, the <em>Pr&aelig;sidium Julium</em> of the Romans, and capital fo the district of Santarem lies on the right bank of the Tagus about 46 miles from Lisbon. The population in 1901 was 9400. It does a large trade in wine and oil, and is the vegetable garden of Lisbon. In the sixteenth century it was of more importance than nowadays, and its population stood at 21,000. A long narrow bridge spans the Tagus, and on a rock in the river stands the castle of Almourel, a building in <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>. Roman relics unearthed in the vicinity incline arch&aelig;ologists to the opinion that the noted Nabantia of the Romans and <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> stood there. The <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> is now a barracks, and the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Santa Iria or Irene is in ruins. Saint Irene (whence the name of the town Santarem) is said to have been the niece of the <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> when the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> ruled that portion of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>.</p>
