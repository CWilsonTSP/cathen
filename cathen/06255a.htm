<p>German King and Roman Emperor, son of <a href="07233a.htm">Henry VI</a> and Constance of Sicily; born 26 Dec., 1194; died at Fiorentina, in Apulia, 13 Dec., 1250.</p>

<p>He adopted his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> policy of making <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> the centre of his power, and was interested in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> only because it guaranteed to him his title to Upper and Central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. On the other hand, he could not arrest the dissolution of the empire hastened by the failure of his predecessor <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a>. The possessions of the empire and those of his own Hohenstaufen <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, by means of which <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick I</a> had sought to build up his power, were plundered. Frederick's sole desire was for peace in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, even if to secure this he had to make the greatest <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; and for this reason, he granted to the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and temporal lords a series of privileges, which subsequently developed into the independent sovereignty of these princes. This emperor's policy was entirely dominated by the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that without <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> the possession of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> would always be insecure, and that a king of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> could not maintain himself without being at the same time emperor. This policy was naturally antagonistic to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, isolated as they were in Central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, felt themselves compelled to prevent the union of Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> with the empire. Frederick recognized this fact, and for several years strove to maintain peace by extreme concessions. <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> had chosen Frederick to be his instrument for the destruction of the <a href="07056c.htm">Guelph</a>, <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a>. In return for <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent's</a> support, Frederick had been <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make promises to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at Eger (12 July, 1215), which would put an end to the undue influence of the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a> over the German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The emancipation of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> from the royal power dates from this time. The cause of Frederick's concessions to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> lay not in his religious convictions but in his political aims.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Frederick had also been <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to acknowledge the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as his overlord in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, thus abandoning his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> cherished hopes of uniting <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> with the imperial crown of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, though the attempts of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to entirely nullify this "personal union" were far from successful. Italian affairs continued to be the hinge on which turned the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> policy towards the emperor, for the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> in their efforts to sustain their traditional supremacy could not allow the emperor a controlling influence in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The conflict between the two powers strangely influenced the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. Frederick had been forced to pledge himself to take part in a new <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>, for which inadequate preparations had been made by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the Council of Lateran (1215) fixed 1 June, 1216, as the time for beginning the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>.</p>

<p>The condition of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, however, did not permit the absence of the emperor. At Frankfort in April, 1220, the <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> diet passed regulations concerning the Roman expedition and the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>. After Frederick's young son Henry had been chosen king, and Engelbert, the powerful <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, named vice-regent, Frederick set out for <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (22 Nov., 1220), and renewed his <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> to take the cross, promising to begin the campaign in the following year. By a severe edict against <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, he placed the <a href="02137c.htm">secular power</a> at the service of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and thus appeared to have arrived at a complete understanding with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Even when he failed to keep his promise to start the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> in the following year, the friendly relations of <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor remained unaltered. For this the peace-loving <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> deserved the chief credit, though Frederick also strove to avoid a breach by his loyal policy towards the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Both Pope and emperor, however, saw that this peace was maintained only by skilful diplomacy, and that it was constantly imperilled by their conflicting interests.</p>

<p>Frederick at this time was chiefly solicitous about <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, towards which he was drawn by his Norman parentage on the mother's side, while the character of his own German people did not attract his sympathies. He had grown up in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> where Norman, Greek, and <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> civilization had intermingled, at once strengthening and repelling one another. The king, endowed with great natural ability, had acquired a wonderful fund of learning which made him appear a prodigy to his contemporaries, but, although he was intimately acquainted with the greatest productions of eastern and western genius, his soaring spirit never lost itself in romantic dreams. He eagerly studied both the more and the less important interests of the political and economical life of Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The funding of the University of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> sufficiently attests his interest in <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. He was an intelligent admirer of the beauties of nature, his <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for which was intensified by his natural powers of observation. The unlimited resources of the physical world and its constantly multiplying problems increased the inclination of this sceptical spirit towards a thorough empiricism. In none of his contemporaries does <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> subjectivism show itself so strongly and at the same time so one-sidedly. This desire to penetrate into the secrets of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>, as well as his <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> sensual indulgence, brought on Frederick the reputation of an <a href="02040a.htm">atheist</a>. In spite, however, of his sceptical tendencies, he was not an <a href="02040a.htm">atheist</a>. An epigrammatic utterance about "the three impostors, Moses, Christ and <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>" has been <a href="08010c.htm">unjustly</a> ascribed to him in later times, and he remained true to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Perhaps his <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> mind took pleasure in the strictly <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> character of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>. He was not, however, a champion of <a href="12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, nor had he any sympathy with the mystico-heretical movements of the time; in fact he joined in suppressing them. It was not the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> that he antagonized, but its representatives. It is in his conflict with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> that his colossal character becomes manifest. At the same time, it becomes apparent how he combined force and ability with cunning and the spirit of revenge. His most prominent characteristic was his self-conceit. In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> this megalomania was kept in check, but not so in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Here he could build up a modern state, the foundation of which it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> had already been laid by the great Norman kings.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The organization of his <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> hereditary states was completed by the "Constitutiones imperiales", published at <a href="01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, 1231. In these <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> Frederick appears as sole possessor of every right and privilege, an absolute monarch, or rather an enlightened despot standing at the head of a well-ordered civil <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. His subjects in this system had <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> only, but they were well defined. After practically completing the reorganization of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (1235), the emperor attempted, like his powerful grandfather, to re-establish the imperial power in Upper <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but with insufficient resources. The result was a new hostile league of the Italian cities. Through the mediation of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, peace was maintained. During this time Archbishop <a href="05429c.htm">Engelbert of Cologne</a>, supported by several princes of the empire who had been efficiently assisted by the royal power in their struggle with the cities, preserved the peace in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. After the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> death, however, a new order set in&mdash;a time of savage feuds and widespread disorder followed by the first open quarrel between the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the emperor. Frederick had completed extensive preparations for a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> in 1227. Four years previously, he had espoused Isabella (or Iolanthe), heiress of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and now styled himself "Romanorum imperator semper Augustus; <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> et Sicili&aelig; rex". It was his serious intention to carry out his promise to begin his <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> in August, 1227 (under pain of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>), but a malignant fever destroyed a great part of his army and prostrated the king himself. Nevertheless <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> declared Frederick <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> (29 Sept., 1227), showing by this step that he considered the time had come to break the illusive peace and to clear up the situation.</p>

<p>Although the radical antagonism between empire and <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> did not appear on the surface, it was at the root of the ensuing conflict between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. At the beginning of this struggle the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> emperor started on his <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the express wish of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, wishing no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> to justify his attitude by success. On 17 March, 1229, he <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> himself King of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. On 10 June, 1229, he landed at <a href="02787e.htm">Brindisi</a> on his return. During the emperor's absence the curia had taken vigorous measures against him. Frederick's energetic action after his return forced the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to recognize the emperor's success in the East and to release him from <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The treaty of San Germano (20 July, 1230), in spite of many concessions made by the Emperor, was in reality an evidence of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> defeat. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had been unable to break the power of his dangerous adversary. Frederick forthwith resumed his North Italian policy. Again his attempts were frustrated, on this occasion by the threatening attitude of his son Henry, who now appeared as independent ruler of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, thereby becoming his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> enemy and unfurling the banner of rebellion (1234). After a long absence, Frederick now returned to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where he took <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> his rebel son (1235). Henry died in 1242.</p>

<p>About this time Frederick married Elizabeth of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> (at Worms), and in 1235 held a brilliant diet at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, where he <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the famous Laws of the Empire, a landmark in the development of the empire and its constitutions. New measures for the maintenance of peace were enacted, the right of private feuds was greatly restricted, and an imperial court with its own seal was constituted, thereby establishing a base for the future national law. As soon as the emperor had established order in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he again marched against the Lombards, which conflict soon brought on another with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The latter had several times mediated between the Lombards and the emperor, and now reasserted his right to arbitrate between the contending parties. In the numerous manifestos of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor the antagonism of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> becomes daily more evident. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> claimed for himself the "imperium animarum" and the "principatus rerum et corporum in universo mundo". The emperor on the other hand wished to restore the "imperium mundi"; <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was again to be the capital of the world and Frederick was to become the real emperor of the Romans. He published an energetic manifesto protesting against the world-empire of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The emperor's successes, especially his victory over the Lombards at the battle of Cortenuova (1237), only embittered the opposition between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who had allied himself with <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, again <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the "self-confessed heretic", the "blasphemous beast of the Apocalypse" (20 March, 1239). Frederick now attempted to conquer the rest of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, i.e. the <a href="14257a.htm">papal states</a>. His son Enrico captured in a sea-fight all the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> who by the command of <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory</a> were coming from <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist at a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a>. <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory's</a> position was now desperate, and, after his death (22 Aug., 1241), the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> remained <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> for almost two years save for the short reign of <a href="03479a.htm">Celestine IV</a>.</p>

<p>During this interval the bitterness existing between the rival parties seemed to moderate somewhat, and about this time the emperor was threatened by a new and dangerous movement in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The German episcopate could ill bear the prospect of being henceforth at the mercy of the reckless tyrant of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Frederick sought to weaken the hostile <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> by favouring the secular princes and granting privileges to the cities. The energetic <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> ascended the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne on 25 June, 1243. To secure peace with the newly elected pontiff, the emperor was inclined to make concessions. The main issue at stake however was not settled, i.e., the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the emperor in North <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In order to nullify Frederick's military superiority in the future phases of the struggle, <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent</a> left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> secretly and went by way of <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a> to Lyons. Here he summoned a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> (21 June, 1245) by which Frederick was again <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Immediately there appeared several pretenders in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, i.e., Henry Raspe of Thuringia and William of <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>. It was only with the greatest difficulty that Frederick's son Conrad could hold his own in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, since the greater part of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> supported the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Most of the lay lords, however, remained faithful to the emperor and exhibited an attitude of hostility to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. A contemporary writer describes as follows the situation in 1246: "Injustice reigned supreme. The people were without leaders and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was troubled. Clerical dignity was lost sight of and the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> were split into various factions. Some were loyal to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and took the cross, others adhered to Frederick and became the enemies of <a href="03744a.htm">God's religion</a>."</p>

<p>For some time fortune alternately smiled and frowned on Frederick in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but after completing all his preparations for a decisive battle, he died at Florentina in Apulia, and was buried at Palermo. In German legend he continued to live as the emperor fated to return and reform both <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. In more recent times, however, he has had to yield his place in popular legend to <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, a figure more in harmony with German sentiment.</p>
