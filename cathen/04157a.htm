<h1>Commentaries on the Bible</h1>

<p>"To write a full history of exegesis", says Farrar, "would require the space of many volumes." Nor is this surprising when it is borne in mind that the number of commentaries on such a recent writer as <a href="04628a.htm">Dante</a> reached the grand total of thirteen hundred at the beginning of the twentieth century. As the ground to be covered is so extensive, only the barest outline can be given here. The bibliography at the end will enable the reader to pursue the subject further. We touch upon the salient points of Jewish, patristic, <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a>, and modern (<a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and non-Catholic) commentaries. We begin with the Jewish writers, and deal briefly with the Targums, Mishna, and Talmuds; for, though these cannot be regarded as Bible commentaries in the proper sense of the word, they naturally lead up to these latter. Those who require further information on this head may be referred to the special articles in THE CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA, and to the works mentioned in the bibliography. Special attention is directed to the list of the best modern non-Catholic commentaries in English [V (3)]. The article is divided as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>I. Jewish Commentaries <br>II. Patristic <br>III. Medieval <br>IV. Modern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <br>V. Non-Catholic</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="section1">Jewish commentaries</h2>

<h3 id="A">Philo</h3>

<p>There was a story among the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> to the effect that <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> accompanied Alexander the Great to Jerusalem, and, with characteristic Greek craftiness, obtained possession of the wisdom of Solomon, which he subsequently palmed off on his countrymen as his own. This accounted for everything that was good in <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>; the defects were the only thing peculiar to the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. That Greek literature, in general, got its inspiration from Moses was an uncritical <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that dated back as far as <a href="12023a.htm">Philo</a>, the great Jewish writer of Alexandria. A visitor to Alexandria at the time when Christ was preaching in <a href="06341c.htm">Galilee</a> would find there and in its vicinity a million <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> using the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> as their Bible, and could enter their magnificent Great Synagogue of which they were justly proud. Whoever had not seen it was not supposed to have beheld the glory of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>. The members of their <a href="13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>, according to Sukkah, were seated on seventy-one golden thrones valued at tens of thousands of talents of gold; and the building was so vast that a flag had to be waved to show the people when to respond. At the head of this assembly, on the highest throne, was seated the alabarch, the brother of Philo. Philo himself was a man of wealth and learning, who mingled with all classes of men and frequented the theatre and the great <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>. Equally at home in the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> and the Greek classics, he was struck and perplexed by the many beautiful and noble thoughts contained in the latter, which could bear comparison with many passages of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. As this difficulty must have frequently presented itself to the minds of his coreligionists, he endeavoured to meet it by saying that all that was great in <a href="14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a>, etc. originated with Moses. He set about reconciling <a href="11388a.htm">Pagan</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> with the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and for this purpose he made extensive use of the allegorical method of interpretation. Many passages of the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> were not intended to be taken literally. They were literally <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>, but allegorically <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>. He did not hit upon the distinction, made later by <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> and other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> thinkers, between natural and <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="12738a.htm">religion</a>. The Bible contains not only revealed but also natural religion, free from <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> and with Divine sanction. <a href="11388a.htm">Pagan</a> systems may have natural religion highly developed, but with much concomitant <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>. Though this distinction did not occur to Philo, his <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> served to tide over the difficulty for the time amongst the Hellenistic <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and had great influence on <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> and other <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandrian Christian</a> writers.</p>

<h3 id="B">The Targums</h3>

<p>In order to get on the main lines of Jewish interpretation it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to turn to the Holy Land. Farrar, in his "Life of Christ", says that it has been suggested that when Christ visited the Temple, at twelve years of age, there may have been present among the <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> Jonathan ben Uzziel, once thought the author of the Yonathan Targum, and the venerable teachers <a href="07354c.htm">Hillel</a> and <a href="13751a.htm">Shammai</a>, the handers-on of the Mishna. The Targums (the most famous of which is that on the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> <a href="05525a.htm">erroneously</a> attributed to Onkelos, a misnomer for Aquila, according to Abrahams) were the only approach to anything like a commentary on the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> before the time of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. They were interpretative translations or paraphrases from Hebrew into Aramaic for the use of the <a href="14379b.htm">synagogues</a> when, after the Exile, the people had lost the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Hebrew. It is <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether any of them were committed to writing before the <a href="04636c.htm">Christian Era</a>. They are important as indicating the character of the Hebrew text used, and because they agree with the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in interpreting certain passages Messianically which later <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> denied to have any <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> bearing.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3 id="C">The Mishna and Talmuds</h3>

<p>Hillel and <a href="13751a.htm">Shammai</a> were the last "pair" of several generations of "pairs" of teachers. These pairs were the successors of the early scribes who lived after the Exile. These teachers are said to have handed down and expanded the Oral Law, which, according to the uncritical view of many <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, began with Moses. This Oral Law, whose origin is buried in obscurity, consists of legal and <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> interpretations and applications of the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. As no part of it was written down, it was preserved by constant repetition (<em>Mishna</em>). On the destruction of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> several rabbis, learned in this Law, settled at Jamnia, near the sea, twenty-eight miles west of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Jamnia became the head-quarters of Jewish learning until 135. Then <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were opened at Sepphoris and <a href="14716a.htm">Tiberias</a> to the west of the <a href="06341c.htm">Sea of Galilee</a>. The rabbis comforted their countrymen by teaching that the study of the Law (Oral as well as Written) took the place of the <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. They devoted their energies to arranging the Unwritten Torah, or Law. One of the most successful at this was Rabbi Akiba who took part in the revolt of Bar-Kokba, against the Romans, and lost his life (135). The work of systematization was completed and probably committed to writing by the Jewish patriarch at <a href="14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>, Rabbi Jehudah ha-Nasi "The Prince" (150-210). He was of noble birth, wealthy, learned, and is called by the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> "Our Master the Saint" or simply Rabbi <em>par excellence</em>. The compilation made by this Rabbi is the Mishna. It is written in New Hebrew, and consists of six great divisions or orders, each division containing, on an average, about ten tractates, each tractate being made up of several chapters. The Mishna may be said to be a compilation of Jewish traditional <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, liturgy, <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, etc. There were other traditions not embodied in the work of Rabbi, and these are called additional Mishna.</p>



<p>The discussions of later generations of rabbis all centred round the text of the Mishna. Interpreters or "speakers" laboured upon it both in Palestine and <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> (until 500), and the results are comprised in the Palestinian and <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmuds. The word <em>Talmud</em> means teaching, <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Each Talmud consists of two parts, the Mishna (in Hebrew), in sixty-three tractates, and an explanation of the same (<em>Gemara</em>), ten or twelve times as long. The explanatory portion of the Palestinian Talmud is written in Western Aramaic and that of the <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud in Eastern Aramaic, which is closely allied to Syriac or Mandaic. The passages in the Gemara containing additional Mishna are, however, given in New Hebrew. Only thirty-nine tractates of the Mishna have Gemara. The Talmud, then, consists of the Mishna (traditions from 450 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> till <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 200), together with a commentary thereon, Gemara, the latter being composed about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 200-500. Next to the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> the <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud is the great religious book of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, though the Palestinian Talmud is more highly prized by modern scholars. From the year 500 till the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the rabbis (<em>geonim</em>) in <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> and elsewhere were engaged in commenting on the Talmud and reconciling it with the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. A list of such commentaries is given in "The Jewish Encyclopedia".</p>

<h3 id="D">The Midrashim</h3>

<p>Simultaneously with the Mishna and Talmud there grew up a number of Midrashim, or commentaries on the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. some of these were legalistic, like the Gemara of the Talmud but the most important were of an edifying, homiletic character (Midrash Haggadah). These latter are important for the corroborative light which they throw on the language of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. The Gospel of St. John is seen to be steeped in early Jewish phraseology, and the words of <a href="../bible/psa109.htm">Psalm 109</a>, "The Lord said to my Lord", etc. are in one place applied to the <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a>, as they are in St. Matthew, though Rashi and later <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> deprived them of their <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> sense by applying them to Abraham.</p>

<h3 id="E">Karaite commentators</h3>

<p>When the nature of the Talmud and other such writings is considered, it is not surprising that they produced a violent reaction against Rabbinism even among the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves. In spite of the few gems of thought scattered through it at long intervals, there is nothing in any literature so entirely uninviting as the Talmud. The opposition to these "traditions of men" finally took shape. Anan ben David, a prominent <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> in the eighth century, rejected Rabbinism for the written <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and became the founder of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> known a Karaites (a word indicating their preference for the written Bible). This <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> produced great energy and ability on both sides. The principal Karaite Bible commentators were Mahavendi (ninth century); Abul-Faraj Harun (ninth century), <a href="05692b.htm">exegete</a> and Hebrew grammarian; Solomon ben Yerucham (tenth century); Sahal-ben Mazliach (died 950), Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer; Joseph al-Bazir (died 930); Japhet ben Ali, the greatest Karaite commentator of the tenth century; and Judah Hadassi (died 1160).</p>

<h3 id="F">Middle Ages</h3>

<p>Saadiah of Fay&ucirc;m (died 892), the most powerful writer against the Karaites, translated the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> into Arabic and added notes. Besides commentaries on the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, Saadiah wrote a systematic treatise bringing <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="12738a.htm">religion</a> into harmony with Greek philosophy. He thus became the forerunner of <a href="09540b.htm">Maimonides</a> and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>. Solomon ben Isaac, called Rashi (born 1040) wrote very popular explanations of the Talmud and the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. <a href="01039c.htm">Abraham Ibn Ezra of Toledo</a> (died 1168) had a good <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Oriental languages and wrote learned commentaries on the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. He was the first to maintain that Isaias contains the work of two <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a>. <a href="09540b.htm">Moses Maimonides</a> (died 1204), the greatest Jewish scholar of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, of whom his coreligionists said that "from Moses to <a href="10596a.htm">Moses</a> there was none like <a href="10596a.htm">Moses</a>", wrote his "Guide to the Perplexed", which was read by <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. He was a great admirer of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, who was to him the representative of natural <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> was of the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. There were the two Kimchis, especially David (died 1235) of Narbonne, who was a celebrated grammarian, lexicographer, and commentator inclined to the literal sense. He was followed by Nachmanides of Catalonia (died 1270), a doctor of medicine who wrote commentaries of a cabbalistic tendency; Immanuel of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (born 1270); and the Karaites Aaron ben Joseph (1294), and Aaron ben Elias (fourteenth century).</p>

<h3 id="G">Modern</h3>

<p>Isaac Abarbanel (born <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 1437; died <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1508) was a statesman and scholar. None of his predecessors came so near the modern ideal of a commentator as he did. He prefixed general introductions to each book, and was the first <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> to make extensive use of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> commentaries. Elias Levita (died 1549) and Azarias de Rossi (died 1577) have also to be mentioned. Moses Mendelssohn of <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a> (died 1786), a friend of Lessing, translated the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> into German. His commentaries (in hebrew) are close, learned, critical, and acute. He has had much influence in modernizing Jewish methods. Mendelssohn has been followed by Wessely, Jaroslaw, Homberg, Euchel, Friedlander, Hertz, Herxheimer, Philippson, etc., called "Biurists", or expositors. The modern liberal <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> among the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> is represented by Munk, Luzzato, Zunz, Geiger, F&uuml;rst, etc. In past ages the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> attributed both the Written and the Unwritten Torahs to Moses; some modern <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> seem disposed to deny that he had anything to do with either.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Patristic commentaries</h2>

<p>The history of <a href="05692b.htm">Christian exegesis</a> may be roughly divided into three periods: the Age of the Fathers, the Age of Caten&aelig; and Scholia (seventh to sixteenth century), and the Age of Modern Commentaries (sixteenth to twentieth century). Most of the patristic commentaries are in the form of <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a>, or discourses to the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and range over the whole of Scripture. There are two <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of interpretation, that of Alexandria and that of Antioch.</p>

<h3 id="A">Alexandrian school</h3>

<p>The chief writers of the Alexandrian School were Pant&aelig;nus, <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, Didymus the blind <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>, and Pierius. To these may be added <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, who, in a moderate degree, adopted their system. Its chief characteristic was the allegorical method. This was doubtless, founded on passages in the Gospels and the <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, but it received a strong impulse from the writings of Alexandrian <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, especially of Philo. The great representative of this <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (died 254). From his very earliest years <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> manifested such extraordinary marks of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and genius that he was held in the very highest reverence by his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, himself a saint and <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>. <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> became the master of many great <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and scholars, one of the most celebrated being <a href="07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>; he was known as the "Adamantine" on account of his incessant application to study, writing, lecturing, and works of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. He frequently kept seven amanuenses actively employed; it was said he became the author of 6000 works (Epiphanius, H&aelig;r., lxiv, 63); according to <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, who reduced the number to 2000 (Contra. Rufin., ii, 22), he left more writings than any man could read in a lifetime (Ep. xxxiii, ad Paulam). Besides his great labours on the <a href="07316a.htm">Hexapla</a> he wrote scholia, <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a>, and commentaries on the Old and the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. In his scholia he gave short explanations of difficult passages after the manner of his contemporaries, the annotators of the Greek classics. Most of the scholia, in which he chiefly sought the literal sense, are unfortunately lost, but it is supposed that their substance is embodied in the writings of <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> and other Fathers. In his other works <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> pushed the allegorical interpretation to the utmost extreme. In spite of this, however, his writings were of great value, and with the exception of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, no writer of ancient times had such influence. It is lamentable that this great man fell into serious <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> on the origin of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, the <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a>, etc.</p>

<h3 id="B">Antiochene school</h3>

<p>The writers of the Antiochene School disliked the allegorical method, and sought almost exclusively the literal, primary, or historical sense of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The principal writers of this <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> were St. Lucian, <a href="05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, Maris of Chalcedon, Eudoxius, Theognis of Nic&aelig;a, Asterius, Arius the heresiarch, Diodorus of Antioch (<a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>), and his three great pupils, <a href="14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, Theodore's brother Polychromius, and <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. With these may be counted <a href="05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a> on account of his preference for the literal sense. The great representatives of this <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> were Diodorus, <a href="14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, and <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. Diodorus, who died <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> (394), followed the literal to the exclusion of the mystical or allegorical sense. Theodore was born at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, in 347, became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10555a.htm">Mopsuestia</a>, and died in the communion of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, 429. He was a powerful thinker, but an obscure and prolix writer. He felt intense dislike for the mystical sense, and explained the Scriptures in an extremely literal and almost <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> manner. His pupil, Nestorius, became a founder of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>; the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> translated his books into Syriac and regarded Theodore as their great "Doctor". This made <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> suspicious of his writings, which were finally condemned after the famous controversy on <a href="14707b.htm">The Three Chapters</a>. Theodore's commentary on St. John's Gospel, in Syriac, has recently been published, with a Latin translation, by a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholar. Dr. Chabot. <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Antioch, became <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople in 398. As an interpreter of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> he stands in the very first rank of the Fathers. He left <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> on most of the books of the Old and the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. There is nothing in the whole of antiquity to equal his writings on St. Matthew's Gospel and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a>. When <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> was asked by one of his brethren whether he would not like to be the owner of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, so that he could dispose of it to the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and with the proceeds promote the <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> of his order, he answered that he would prefer to be the possessor of <a href="08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> "Super Matth&aelig;um". This reply may be taken as the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> expression of the high admiration in which the writings of <a href="08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> have ever been held in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="08185c.htm">St. Isidore of Pelusium</a> said of him that if the <a href="11567b.htm">Apostle St. Paul</a> could have used Attic speech he would have explained his own Epistles in the identical words of <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>.</p>

<h3 id="C">Intermediate school</h3>

<p>The other Fathers combined what was best in both these systems, some learning more to the allegorical and some to the literal sense. The principal were <a href="08185c.htm">Isidore of Pelusium</a>, Theodoret, <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, <a href="07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, <a href="07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a>, <a href="01406a.htm">Ambrosiaster</a>, <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, and <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, perhaps the greatest Biblical scholar of ancient times, besides his famous translations of the Scripture, and other works, left many useful commentaries, some of great merit. In others he departed too much from the literal meaning of the text. In the hurry of composition he did not always sufficiently indicate when he was quoting from different authors. and this, according to Richard Simon, accounts for his apparent discrepancies.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Medieval commentaries</h2>

<p>The <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers were content to draw from the rich treasures left them by their predecessors. Their commentaries consisted, for the most part, of passages from the Fathers, which they connected together as in a chain, <em>catena</em> (q.v.). We cannot give more than the names of the principal writers, with the century after each. Though they are not all known as catenists they may be regarded as such, for all practical purposes.</p>

<h3 id="A">Greek catenists</h3>

<p>Procopius of <a href="06399c.htm">Gaza</a> (sixth century) was one of the first to write a catena. He was followed by St. Maximus, Martyr (seventh), <a href="08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (eighth), Olympiodorus (tenth), <a href="11214b.htm">&OElig;cumenius</a> (tenth), Nicetas of Constantinople (eleventh), Theophylactus, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> in <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> (eleventh), Euthymius Zigabenus (twelfth), and the writers of anonymous caten&aelig; edited by Cramer and <a href="09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai</a>.</p>

<h3 id="B">Latin catenists, scholiasts, etc.</h3>

<p>The principal Latin commentators of this period were the <a href="02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>, Walafrid Strabo, <a href="01550b.htm">Anselm of Laon</a>, Hugh of Saint-Cher, <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, and <a href="11063a.htm">Nicholas de Lyra</a>. The <a href="02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (seventh to eighth century), a good Greek and Hebrew scholar, wrote a useful commentary on most of the books of the Old and the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. It is in reality a catena of passages from Greek and <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> judiciously selected and digested. Walafrid Strabo (ninth century), a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, wrote the "Glossa Ordinaria" on the entire <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. It is a brief explanation of the literal and mystical sense, based on <a href="12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> and other Latin writers, and was one of the most popular works during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, being as well known as "The Sentences" of <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. Anselm, Dean of Laon, and professor at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (twelfth century), wrote the "Glossa Interlinearis", so called because the explanation was inserted between the lines of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. The <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, Hugh of Saint-Cher (Hugo de Sancto Caro, thirteenth century), besides his famous "Concordance", composed a short commentary on the whole of the Scriptures, explaining the literal, allegorical, analogical, and moral sense of the text. His work was called "Postill&aelig;", i.e. <em>post illa</em> (<em>verba textus</em>), because the explanation followed the words of the text. <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> (thirteenth century) left commentaries on Job, Psalms, <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and was the author of the well-known "Catena Aurea" on the Gospels. This consists of quotations from over eighty Greek and <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a>. He throws much light on the literal sense and is most <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> in illustrating difficult points by parallel passages from other parts of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. <a href="11063a.htm">Nicholas de Lyra</a> (thirteenth century), a converted <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>, joined the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in 1291, and brought to the service of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> his great <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Hebrew and rabbinical learning. He wrote short notes or "Postill&aelig;" on the entire Bible, and set forth the literal meaning with great ability, especially of the books written in Hebrew. This work was most popular, and in frequent use during the late <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> was indebted to it for his display of learning. A great impulse was given to <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> studies by the Council of Vienne which decreed, in 1311, that chairs of Hebrew, Chaldean, and Arabic should be established at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, Bologna, and Salamanca.</p>

<p>Besides the great writers already mentioned the following are some of the principal <a href="05692b.htm">exegetes</a>, many of them <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, from patristic times till the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>: <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> (sixth century); <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> (seventh); St. Julian of Toledo (seventh); <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> (eighth); <a href="12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> (ninth); Druthmar (ninth); <a href="12764a.htm">Remigius of Auxerre</a> (ninth); <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> of <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, a distinguished Greek and Hebrew scholar; <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, founder of the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> (eleventh); Gilbert of Poir&eacute;e; <a href="13229a.htm">St. Rupert</a> (twelfth); <a href="01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> (thirteenth); <a href="01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> (thirteenth); <a href="11588a.htm">Paul of Burgos</a> (fourteenth to fifteenth); Alphonsus Tostatus of <a href="02160b.htm">Avila</a> (fifteenth); <a href="09416b.htm">Ludolph of Saxony</a>; and <a href="04734a.htm">Dionysius the Carthusian</a>, who wrote a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> commentary on the whole of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>; <a href="09114b.htm">Jacobus Faber Stapulensis</a> (fifteenth to sixteenth); Gagn&aelig;us (fifteenth to sixteenth). <a href="05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> and <a href="03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a> (sixteenth) wrote in a scientific spirit, but have been justly blamed for some rash opinions.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Modern Catholic commentaries</h2>

<p>The influx of Greek scholars into <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> on the fall of <a href="04301a.htm">Constantinople</a>, the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> and anti-Christian <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, the invention of printing, the controversial excitement caused by the rise of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and the publication of polyglot Bibles by Cardinal Ximenes and others, gave renewed interest to the study of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars. Controversy showed them the necessity of devoting more attention to the literal meaning of the text, according to the wise principle laid down by <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> in the beginning of his <a href="../summa.html">"Summa Theologica"</a>.</p>

<p>It was then that the sons of St. Ignatius, who founded his order in 1534, stepped into the front rank to repel the attacks on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="12654a.htm">Ratio Studiorum</a> of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> made it incumbent on their professors of Scripture to acquire a mastery of Greek, Hebrew, and other Oriental languages. Salmeron, one of the first companions of St. Ignatius, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> at the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, was a distinguished Hebrew scholar and voluminous commentator. <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, one of the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> to write a Hebrew grammar, composed a valuable commentary on the Psalms, giving an exposition of the Hebrew, <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, and <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> texts. It was published as part of <a href="04377a.htm">Cornelius a Lapide's</a> commentary on the whole Bible. <a href="04377a.htm">Cornelius a Lapide, S.J.</a> (born 1566), was a native of the Low Countries, and was well versed in Greek and Hebrew. During forty years he devoted himself to teaching and to the composition of his great work, which has been highly praised by <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> as well as <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a>, a <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, born 1584, wrote commentaries on Isaias, Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, Psalms, Proverbs, Canticles (Song of Solomon), and Ecclesiastes. His best work, however, is his Latin commentary on the <a href="06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the best ever written. When <a href="09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a> was teaching at the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> the hall was filled with eager students before the lecture began, and he had frequently to speak in the open air. Great as was the merit of the work of <a href="09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a>, it was equalled by the commentary on the Epistles by <a href="05547a.htm">Estius</a> (born at Gorcum, Holland, 1542), a <a href="13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, and superior of the College at <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a>. These two works are still of the greatest help to the student. Many other <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were the authors of valuable <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works, e.g.: Francis Ribera of Castile (born 1514); Cardinal Toletus* of <a href="04359b.htm">Cordova</a> (born 1532); <a href="13285a.htm">Manuel Sa</a> (died 1596); Bonfr&egrave;re of Dinant (born 1573); Mariana of Talavera (born 1537); Alcazar of Seville (born 1554); Barradius "the Apostle of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>"; S&aacute;nchez of Alcal&aacute; (died 1628); Serarius of Lorraine (died 1609); Lorinus of Avignon (born 1559); Tirinus of <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> (born 1580); Menochius of Pavia; Pereira of Valencia (died 1610); and Pineda of Seville.</p>

<p>The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were rivalled by <a href="01711c.htm">Arias Montanus</a> (died 1598), the editor of the Antwerp Polyglot Bible; Sixtus of <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>, O. P.

<h2 id="section5">Non-Catholic commentaries</h2>

<h3 id="A">In general</h3>

<p>The commentaries of the first <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, <a href="15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, etc., are mostly controversial, and are now seldom quoted by scholars. Their immediate successors were too energetically engaged in polemics among themselves to devote much time to regular works of <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. The following wrote on <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> during the 17th and 18th centuries. <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>: Gerhard; Geier; Calov; S. Schmid; J. H. Michaelis; Lange. <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>: Drusius; Louis de Dieu (great Oriental scholar); Cappel; Bochart; Cocceius; Vitringa. <a href="14113a.htm">Socinians</a>: John Crell and Jonas Schlichting. <a href="01740c.htm">Arminians</a>: Hugo Grotius (a man of great erudition); Limbroch; John le Clerc (rationalistic).

Other writers are Farrar, A. B. Davidson, Fausset, Plummer, Plumptre, Salmon, Swete, Bruce, Dods, Stanley, Driver, Kirkpatrick, Sanday, Green, Hovey, Robinson, Schaff, Briggs, Moore, Gould, etc. "The International Critical Commentary" is a work by many distinguished American and English scholars. There are also the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> dictionaries of Kitto, Smith, and Hastings. Many of these works, especially the later ones, are valuable for their scientific method, though not of equal value for their views or conclusions.

<h3 id="B">Rationalistic commentaries</h3>

<p>The English deists, Lord Herbert of Cherbury (died 1648), Hobbes, Blount, Toland, Lord Shaftesbury (died 1713), <a href="09587b.htm">Mandeville</a>, Collins, Woolston (1731), Tindal, Morgan, Chubb, Lord Bolingbroke (died 1751), Annet, and David Hume (died 1776), while admitting the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, rejected the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and made desperate attacks on different parts of the Old and the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. They were ably refuted by such men as Newton, Cudworth, Boyle, Bentley, Lesley, Locke, Ibbot, Whiston, S. Clarke, Sherlock, Chandler, Gilbert West, George Lord Lytton, Waterland, Foster, Warburton, Leland, Law, Lardner, Watt, Butler. These replies were so effective that in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> deism practically died with Hume. In the meantime, unfortunately, the opinions of the English <a href="12652a.htm">rationalists</a> were disseminated on the Continent by Voltaire and others. In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> the ground was prepared by the philosophy of Christian Wolff and the writings of his disciple Semler. Great <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> was caused by the posthumous writings of Raimarus, which were published by Lessing between 1774-78 (The Fragments of Wolfenb&uuml;ttel). Lessing pretended that he discovered the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the ducal <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of Wolfenb&uuml;ttel and that the author was unknown. According to the "Fragments", Moses, <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the Apostles were impostors. Lessing was vigorously attacked, especially by G&ouml;tze; but Lessing, instead of meeting his opponent's arguments, with great literary skill turned him to ridicule. The <a href="12652a.htm">rationalists</a>, however, soon realized that the Scriptures had too genuine a ring to be treated as the results of imposture. Eichhorn, in his "Introd. to the Old Test." (1789), maintained that the Scriptures were genuine productions, but that, as the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> saw the intervention of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in the most ordinary natural occurrences, the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> should be explained naturally, and he proceeded to show how. Paulus (1761-1850), following the lead of Eichhorn, applied to the Gospels the naturalistic method of explaining <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>. When Paulus was a boy, his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> mind became deranged, he constantly saw his deceased wife and other ministering <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, and he perceived <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> everywhere. After a time the young Paulus began to shake off this nightmare and amused himself by taking advantage of his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> weakness, and playing practical jokes upon him. He grew up with the most bitter dislike for everything <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and his judgment became almost as warped as that of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, but in the opposite direction. The Apostles and early <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> appeared to him to be people just like his worthy parent, and he thought that they distorted natural facts through the medium of their excited imaginations. This led him to give a naturalistic explanation of the Gospel <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>.</p>

<p>The common sense of the German <a href="12652a.htm">rationalists</a> soon perceived, however, that if the authenticity of the Sacred Books were admitted, with Eichhorn and Paulus, the naturalistic explanation of these two writers was quite as absurd as the impostor system of Raimarus. In order to do away with the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> it was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to get rid of the authenticity of the books; and to this the observations of Richard Simon and <a href="02031b.htm">Astruc</a> readily lent themselves. G. L Bauer, Heyne (died 1812), and Creuzer denied the authenticity of the greater portion of the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> and compared it to the mythology of the Greeks and Romans. The greatest advocate of such views was de Wette (1780-1849), a pupil of Paulus, of the hollowness of whose method he soon became convinced. In his "Introd. to the Old Test." (1806) he maintained that the <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> narratives of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were but popular legends, which, in passing from mouth to mouth, in the course of centuries, became transformed and transfused with the marvellous and the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and were finally committed to writing in perfectly <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a>. Strauss (1808-74), in his "Das Leben Jesu" (1835) applied this mythical explanation to the Gospels. He showed most clearly, that if with Paulus the Gospels are allowed to be authentic, the attempt to explain the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> naturally breaks down completely. Strauss rejected the authenticity and regarded the <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> accounts in the Gospels as naive legends, the productions of the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> imaginations of the early generations of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The views of Strauss were severely criticized by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="08703a.htm">Kuhn</a>, Mack, <a href="07515a.htm">Hug</a>, and Sepp, and by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> Neander, Tholuck, Ullman, Lange, Ewald, Riggenbach, Weiss, and Keim. Baur especially, the founder of the T&uuml;bingen School, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that Strauss ran counter to the most clearly established facts of early <a href="07365a.htm">Christian history</a>, and showed the folly of denying the historical existence of Christ and His transcendent <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>. Even Strauss lost all confidence in his own system. Baur, unfortunately, originated a theory which was for a time in great vogue, but which was afterwards abandoned by the majority of critics. He held that the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> contains the writings of two antagonistic parties amongst the Apostles and early <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. His principal followers were Zeller, Schwegler, Planck, K&ouml;slin, Ritsch, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar, Tobler, Keim, Hosten, some of whom, however, emancipated themselves from their master.</p>

<p>Besides the writers already mentioned, the following wrote in a <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> spirit: Ernesti (died 1781), Semler (1791), Berthold (1822), the Rosenm&uuml;llers, Crusius (1843), Bertheau, De Wette, Hupfeld, Ewald, Thenius, Fritzsche, Justi, Gesenius (died 1842), Longerke, Bleek, Bunsen (1860), Umbreit, Kleinert, Knobel, Nicolas, Hirzel, Kuenen, J. C. K. von Hoffmann, Hitzig (died 1875), Schulz (1869), B. Weiss, Renan, Tuch, H. A. W. Meyer* (and his continuators Huther, Luneman, Dusterdieck, Br&uuml;ckner, etc.), Wellhausen, Wieseler, J&uuml;licher, Beyschlag, H. Holtzmann, and his collaborators Schmiedel, von Soden, etc. Holtzmann, while practically admitting the authenticity of the Gospels, especially of St. Mark, endeavours to explain away the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>. He approaches the subject with his mind made up that <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> do not happen, and he tries to get rid of them by cleverly attempting to show that they are merely echoes of <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a> stories. In this he is quite as unsuccessful as Paulus, who saw in them only the counterpart of the distorted imaginings of his unfortunate father. Holtzmann is severely taken to task by several writers in the "International Critical Commentary". The attempt to get rid of the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> has completely failed; but the activity of so many acute minds has thrown great light on the language and literature of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>.</p>

<h3 id="C">The best modern (non-Catholic) commentaries in English</h3>

<p>There is a very useful list of such commentaries in "The Expository Times" (vol. XIV, Jan. and Feb., 1903, 151, 203), by Henry Bond, Librarian of Woolwich. It is the result of opinions which he obtained from many of the most renowned English scholars. The number of votes given for the different works is printed after each name; but no name appears on the list unless it received more than five votes. The editor, Dr. James Hastings, added judicious notes and observations (270, 358). The following list is based, in great measure, on these papers, supplemented from other sources. The works are distinguished as follows: (e) excellent; (g) good; (f) fair. Some of those marked (g) and (f) were excellent for the time in which they were published; and they may still be regarded as serviceable. The characterization of each is, of course, from the non-Catholic point of view.</p>
