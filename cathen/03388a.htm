<p>The name is derived from the French <em>chartreuse</em> through the Latin <em>cartusia</em>, of which the English "charterhouse" is a corruption. For the foundation of the order see the article <a href="03014b.htm">SAINT BRUNO</a>. The following points will be considered here:</p>

<blockquote><p>I. The Rule; <br>II. Life of the Monks; <br>III. Organization; <br>IV. Development; <br>V. Present State of the Order; <br>VI. Distinguished Carthusians; <br>VII. English Province; <br>VIII. Carthusian Nuns.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="section1">The rule</h2>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>We have two accounts of the manner of life of the first Carthusians, the earliest, written by Guibert, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Nogent, the second by Peter the Venerable, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny. The former runs as follows: "The church stands upon a ridge . . . thirteen <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> dwell there, who have a sufficiently convenient <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a>, in accordance with the cenobitic custom, but do not live together <em>claustraliter</em> like other <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. Each has his own cell round the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a>, and in these they work, sleep, and eat. On <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> they receive the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> bread and vegetables (for the week) which is their only kind of food and is cooked by each one in his own cell; water for drinking and for other purposes is supplied by a conduit . . . . There are no gold or silver ornaments in their church, except a silver <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a>. They do not go to the church as we do [Guibert was a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>], but only for certain of them. They hear Mass, unless I am mistaken, on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and solemnities. They hardly ever speak, and, if they want anything, ask for it by a sign. If they ever drink wine, it is so watered down as to be scarcely better than plain water. They wear a hair shirt next the skin, and their other garments are thin and scanty. They live under a <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a>, and the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> acts as their <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> and <em>provisor</em> . . . Lower down the mountain there is a building containing over twenty most faithful <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> [<em>laicos</em>], who work for them. . . . Although they observe the utmost poverty, they are getting together a very rich <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>. (P.L., CLVI, 853 sqq.).</p>

<p>Peter the Venerable adds certain details, lays stress on the poorness of their garments, and mentions that they restricted their possessions both in land and cattle, and fixed their own number at thirteen <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, eighteen <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and a few servants. Of their diet he says, "They always abstain from the eating of meat, whether in health or ill. They never buy fish, but accept them if given in charity. Cheese an eggs are allowed on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Thursdays. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, they eat cooked vegetables, but on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, they take only bread and water. They eat once a day only, save at <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, Pentecost, Epiphany, and on certain other festivals . . . . On feast days they go to the refectory, eat twice, and sing the whole office in the church." (P.L., (CLXXXIX, 944 D.)</p>

<p>Guibert wrote in 1104, Peter some twenty years later, so there was time for development, which may account for certain discrepancies between the two accounts. The "Customsi" of the Chartreuse were not committed to writing till 1127. Bruno had left the world in order to serve <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in solitude, and without any intention of founding an order. In the earliest days the <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> had no rule, but all strove to live after Bruno's example and in accordance with the Evangelical counsels. When regular monastic buildings were erected and vocations began to increase, some sort of rule became a necessity. <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> wrote none, but the customs which he introduced, together with additions born of experience, were embodied in the "Consuetudines" written by Guigo, the fifth prior, in 1127. This was not a rule written with authority, but a record of the usages of the motherhouse of the order (Ann., 1, 305), compiled at the request of the <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a> of the charterhouses, and finally accepted by them as their code. In the introduction the writer says that almost all the customs are contained "either in the epistles of the Blessed Jerome, or in the <a href="02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, or in other authorized writings". A later writer, Boso, the nineteenth <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Grande Chartreuse (d. 1313), says, "It is clear that the contents of the Statutes come either from <a href="02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a>, <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> Epistles, the 'Vitae Patrum' or the 'collationes' and other writings of Cassian and the Fathers" (quoted in Ann., 1, 37). The <a href="02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> (the only monastic rule of those days) gave the norm of those <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> which were performed in common, and supplied the arrangement of the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, the treatment of guests, the form of the <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>. Many new departures were introduced to meet the needs of the solitude which is an essential of the Carthusian life; from the Fathers of the Desert came the laura-like arrangement of the building and the solitary life of the cells, while the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> are probably also indebted to the Rule of Camaldoli (see <a href="03204d.htm">CAMALDOLESE</a>) (founded by St. Romuald in 1012), which was reduced to writing by the Blessed Rudolf in 1080. The fundamental principle of Camaldoli and the Chartreuse is the same, namely, the combination of <a href="10472a.htm">Western monasticism</a> as embodied in <a href="02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a> with the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life of the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> solitaries. In both orders the superiors were to be <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a>, not <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and in all the earliest Carthusian houses there was, as at Camaldoli, a "lower house" for <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> who served the external needs of the contemplative <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> at the "upper house". The first <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> tended strongly to be purely <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a>, but the cenobitic development was hastened hour by the necessities of life find by the influence of neighbouring <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> houses, especially perhaps of Cluny. The union of the two systems was only gradually evolved under the pressure of circumstance.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Guigo's "Consuetudines" were first approved by <a href="08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> in 1133 (Ann., I, 305) and are still the basis of the modern <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>. In 1258 the general, Dom Riffier, issued a new edition, adding various ordinances passed by the general chapters since 1127; these are known as the "Statuta Antiqua". The "Statuta Nova" with similar additions appeared in 1368. In 1509 the general chapter approved the "Tertia Compilatio", consisting of a collection of the ordinances of the chapters and a synopsis of the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>. The Carthusian Rule was printed for the first time by Johann Amorbach at Basle in 1510. This volume contains Guigo's "Consuetudines", the "Statuta Antiqua", the "Statuta Nova", and the "Tertia Compilatio". The "Nova Collectio Statutorum" was published in 1581. This work, which had cost eleven years of preparatory labour, includes in one well-ordered series all the various legislation scattered throughout the cumbersome volume of 1510. A century later a second edition was printed at the Correrie or "lower house" of the Grande Chartreuse by order of Dom Innocent Le Masson, and this, after receiving certain corrections of slight importance, was finally confirmed by <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Injunctum nobis" of 1588. The fifth edition of the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> is a verbal reprint of the second. The first part, or "Ordinarium", which is printed separately, is concerned with church ceremonial, the second treats of the government of the order and the observances and occupation of the religious, the third is concerned with the <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Guigo's "Consuetudines" contains in substance the customs introduced by <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> with certain additions and modifications. The many formal changes and accretions which the original "Consuetudines" have undergone, have affected neither their substance nor their spirit, but, as Le Masson says, "have been like a change of clothing, which adds nothing and takes nothing from the substance of the body" (Discip. Ord. Cart., 1, vii, 9). We must remember that the pictures given by Guibert and Peter the Venerable depict the Carthusian life at a stage of semi-development. The only mitigation of importance introduced since Guigo's day is the decrease of the fast on bread and water from thrice to once weekly. Additional <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> have been laid upon the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in the shape of extra <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the singing of a daily conventual Mass, the lengthening of the night Office and of the Office for the Dead, and the withdrawal of the permission to take a midday siesta, while, instead of having, as formerly, seven or eight hours uninterrupted sleep, their rest is now broken by the long night vigils (P.L., CLTII, 609A).</p>

<h2 id="section2">Life of the monks</h2>

<p>A Carthusian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> covers a great deal of ground owing to the system of life. It usually consists, of the great <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a>, round which are the separate houses, or "cells" of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, the lesser <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> with cells of various officials, the "obediences", or workshops of the <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and their living rooms, church, <a href="03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, refectory and other conventual offices. The church is usually small and without <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a>, divided by a solid screen with a door and two altars into the choir proper and <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>' choir. No organ is allowed. There is usually a tribune for visitors. No <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>, save the sovereign, may enter a charterhouse. At the side of each cell door is the <em>guichet</em> or hatch, through which the <a href="10487b.htm">monk's</a> food is introduced by a <a href="09093a.htm">lay brother</a>; within, a covered <em>ambulacrum</em>, with a small garden beside it, leads to the house. This consists of five rooms; on the ground floor, a store room for timber and fuel, and a workshop with a lathe and other tools; above, an antechamber, a small <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> with just sufficient room for bookcase, chair, table, and the cell proper, whose furniture consists of a wooden box-bedstead with woollen blankets, and mattress of straw, a table for meals, a few chairs, a stove, and a stall with a <em>prie-Dieu</em>, known as the <em>oratorium</em>.</p>

<p>The Carthusian life is essentially solitary and contemplative with a certain admixture of the cenobitic element (see I). A very large part of the day is devoted to saying the three Offices (i.e. that of the day, the Office of Our Lady, which is called <em>de Beata</em>, and the <a href="11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>), while much time is given to <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The rest is divided between manual labour, study, and a little recreation. The whole <em>horarium</em> depends on whether the Office of the day be that of the <em>feria</em> or of a <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> or feast. The following is the <a href="06043a.htm">ferial</a> arrangement, which is by far the commoner. The Carthusian's day begins at half-past five, when a junior <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, going the round of the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a>, rings a bell hanging near the sleeper's ear. The church bell rings at six, when Prime of the day is said in the oratorium, followed by <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a> <em>de Beata</em>. All offices said in the oratorium are accompanied by full choir ceremonial, as bowing, covering, and uncovering. At half-past six the Angelus sounds, and the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> remains at <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> till a quarter to seven, when he goes to the church. The conventual Mass, which is always sung, is preceded by adoration of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> and the <a href="09286a.htm">litanies</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. The Carthusian liturgy differs considerably from the <a href="13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, being substantially that of <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> in the twelfth century with some admixture from other sources. There are no servers at the high Mass, and the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is attended by the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who wears neither <a href="01251b.htm">alb</a> nor <a href="04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, but the <em>cuculla ecclesiastica</em> (see below) and, for the Gospel only, a stole. The <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> merely reads the Epistle at the lectern in the middle of the choir. There are many other points of difference. Copes and <a href="11344a.htm">monstrances</a> are unknown in the charterhouse. After the conventual Mass the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> say their private Masses, reciting <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a> with the server before vesting and Sext <em>de Beata</em> after their thanksgiving.</p>

<p>At about half-past eight the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> returns to his cell and is occupied with manual work and meditation till ten, when, after saying Sext of the day, he fetches his dinner from the <em>guichet</em>. The meal is copious and excellently cooked, consisting of vegetable soup, fish or eggs, vegetables, cheese, butter and fruit, and a small bottle of wine or, in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, of rather thin beer. After dinner there is an hour and a half of solitary recreation, which may be spent in garden, ambulacrum, or cell at will, and is followed by None; spiritual reading, study, and manual labour till half-past two, when <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> <em>de Beata</em> are said. At a quarter to three the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> leaves his cell for the second time, going to the church to sing <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, and, except on feasts and their vigils, <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> and <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a> of the Dead. He returns to his cell about four, and, after half an hour's study, takes his supper, consisting generally of eggs and a little salad. This is followed by spiritual reading and <a href="05675a.htm">examination of conscience</a>, known in the order as the "recollection". At a quarter to six, but earlier on the eve of a feast, the bell sounds for <a href="04187a.htm">Complin</a> of the day and <em>de Beata</em>. At about half-past six the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> retires to bed, still wearing the greater part of his habit. Five hours after the <a href="04187a.htm">Complin</a> bell, he rises and says <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a> <em>de Beata</em> with the Psalm "Deus venerunt gentes" and certain <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the recovery of the Holy Land. These last were ordered to be said during Mass by the Lateran Council in 1215, and were retained <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> bv the Carthusians after the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> ceased to bind, but transferred to this hour. At a quarter to twelve the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> leaves his cell for the third and last time to sing <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a> with <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a> of the Dead. This takes two and a half to three hours. To a visitor it is very impressive. A large portion of the Office is sung in complete darkness save for the sanctuary lamps, the rest by the light of small oil lamps carefully shaded to throw their light only on the choir books, one of which is provided for every three religious. The Carthusian chant, a species of Gregorian, has a special character of its own, slow and plaintive. "As the duty of a good monk is rather to lament than to sing", say the <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, "we must so sing that lamentation, not the <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> of singing, be in our hearts." At about a quarter past two in the morning the Carthusian returns to his cell, where he says Prime <em>de Beata</em>. His total of sleep, thus broken into two parts, is seldom less than seven hours. On <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days this <em>horarium</em> is considerably modified. The community assemble for all the Hours of the Great Office in church, and in the refectory for both meals. These latter are always eaten in silence, while the Scripture or some <a href="07448a.htm">homily</a> of the Fathers is chanted to the solemn tones of the nocturn-lessons. On these days also there is a common recreation with talking in the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> for the solemnly professed, but only on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> for all. Once every week, the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> go out for a walk together, during which they converse. This is known as the <em>Spatiamentum</em> and usually lasts about three and a half hours.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>During the great monastic fast, which lasts from 14 September to <a href="01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>, except for <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days, dinner is an hour later, and supper consists of a glass of wine and a crust of bread <em>ne potus noceat</em> (Statutes). During <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>, <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> are sung before dinner, which is not till midday and supper is as above. Meat is never allowed on any account, though, in a case of life and death, the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> may, if not solemnly professed, be dispensed. Once a week there is a fast on bread and water and during <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>, on Fridays and on certain vigils <em>lacticinia</em> are forbidden.</p>

<p>The Carthusian wears the ordinary monastic habit in white serge, but the <a href="13508b.htm">scapular</a> which is joined by bands at the side and has the hood attached to it, is known as the "cowl". The long flowing garment with wide sleeves, which usually bears this name, is used only by the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> at high Mass. No <a href="02362a.htm">beard</a> is worn, and the hair is shaved except for a narrow strip round the head. Novices wear a black mantle and their cowl is short and unjoined. The postulancy usually lasts one month, the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> one year, at the end which simple <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> are taken; the solemn <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> are taken four years later.</p>

<p>The <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> live an entirely cenobitical life, and are occupied in the servile work of the establishment. Their habit differs only slightly from that of the fathers. After two years postulancy and <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, the lay <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> becomes a <em>donn&eacute;</em>, wearing a brown habit, but takes no <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>. He may remain always in this condition, but it requires eight more years to become a solemnly professed <a href="09093a.htm">lay brother</a>. The <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and <em>donn&eacute;s</em>, collectively known as the <em>Familia</em>, are under the <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a>, and have their own <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, <a href="03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, and refectory. Their Office consists of a large number of Paters and Aves. They attend the night Office, conventual Mass, and <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts, but usually only the first part of the night Office.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Organization</h2>

<p>The <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Grande Chartreuse, who is elected by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of that house, is always the general of the order. He wears no insignia, but is the only one in the order who receives the title of "Reverend Father", all other religious being known as "Venerable Fathers". The general chapter, which consists of the visitors and all the <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a>, meets annually, and receives the resignations of all the superiors of the order including the general. These it reinstates or removes at will. Its ordinances have the force of law, but do not become permanent unless twice renewed. The visitors, who are appointed by the chapter, make a visitation of each charterhouse every two vears, to enquire into its condition and reform any abuses. The first general chapter of the order was held by St. Anthelm in 1142, and in the year 1258 its powers were confirmed by <a href="01287b.htm">Pope Alexander IV</a>. To the wise ordinances of this body and to its series of distinguished generals the order owes its claim <em>nunquam reformata quia nunquam deformata</em>.</p>

<p>The <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of each house is, in strict law, elected by the professed <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of the community, if there are four present who have been actually professed for that house or who are original founders. Nowadays he is generally the father general and the chapter. The prior is assisted by various officials. These are the vicar, who takes the prior's place in case of necessity, the <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a>, who is entrusted with the temporal administration and the care of the <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, the coadjutor, who looks after guests and retreatants, the antiquior, who takes the vicar's place, the <a href="13322a.htm">sacristan</a>, and the novice-master.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Development</h2>

<p>From its very nature the order grew slowly. In 1300 there were but 39 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but during the fourteenth century 113 were founded, extending as far as Silesia, Bobemia, and <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. During the Great Schism there were two generals, but both resigned on the election of <a href="01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> in 1409 and the order was once more united. During the fifteenth century, 44 charterhouses were founded and in 1521 there were in all 206, but during the sixteenth century 39 were destroyed by the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and only 13 founded. In 1559 a foundation in Mexico was projected but fell through owing to the opposition of the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Writing in 1607 Le Masson says, "We number about 2,500 choir <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and 1,300 <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and <em>donn&eacute;s</em>, giving an average of a dozen fathers and eight or nine <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> to each house". Between 1600 and 1667, 22 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded, and then no more till the nineteenth century. The order entirely escaped the scourge of commendatory superiors. <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> suppressed 24 houses, and in 1784 the Spanish Government compelled its charterhouses to separate from the order.</p>

<p>The French charterhouses were less infected with <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> than most of the ancient orders. Owing to the energy of the general, Dom Antoine* de Mongeffond, only thirty <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> out of a total of over 1,000, and those mostly belonging to the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> house, ultimately refused to sign the <a href="15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>. These fled to Utrecht. At the outbreak of the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> there were 122 charterhouses, which were nearly all suppressed, as the French armies swept over <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In 1816 the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> returned to the Grande Chartreuse. The Spanish houses were suppressed in 1835; the Port-Dietu in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, which had escaped the earlier storm, in 1847; the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> for a second time during the course of the Risorgimento; and the restored French houses as a consequence of the Association Laws of 1901.</p>

<h2 id="section5">Present state of the order</h2>

<p>In 1900 the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> possessed eleven <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and nine in other parts of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The French houses are now empty and four new or restored houses have been opened in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The following is a list of the charterhouses existing at the end of 1907. In <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>: Farneta, near <a href="09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, recently repurchased and occupied by the general and the <em>conventus Cartusiae</em>; <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>; Florence, where the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> are merely custodians of a national monument; Trisulti, near Alatri; La Torre, in Calabria; Vedana, in the Diocese of Belluno; La Cervara, near <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, recently repurchased. The <em>Procura</em> of the order at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>: Monte Allegro, near Barcelona; Aula Dei, Pe&ntilde;aflor, near Saragossa; Miraflores, with its splendid royal <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a>; the liqueur is made at the Casa de los Cartujos, Tarragona. In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>: Parkminster, in Sussex, is the largest charterhouse in the world, with thirty-six cells and 3,166 feet of <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a>. It now contains the community of Notre-Dame de Pr&egrave;s, Montreuil, as well as its own. In <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>: Val-Sainte in Canton Friburg. In Gerimany: Hain near D&uuml;sseldorf. In <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> Pletterjack, founded in 1403, abandoned 1595, and since rebuilt. In <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>: the printing works belonging to Montreuil are now at <a href="14798a.htm">Tournai</a>. There are 300 solemnly professed <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, 35 junior professed, and 15 <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>, making 350 choir <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, of whom about 20 are not yet priests; also about the same total of <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, lay <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>, and <em>donn&eacute;s</em>. The badge of the order is a globe surrounded by a cross and seven stars, with the motto "Stat crux, dum volvitur orbis".</p>

<p>The famous liqueur is a secret manufacture, invented by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in the nineteenth century, as a means of subsistence, to take the place of the broad acres lost in the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. The large proceeds, after assisting to pay for the maintenance of the various charterhouses and the building of new ones, has been entirely devoted to various <a href="03592a.htm">works of charity</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section6">Distinguished Carthusians</h2>

<p>Besides <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> the best known <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> of the order are: <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln (d. 1200); St. Anthelm, seventh <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the Grande Chartreuse, and first general, who died <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02415a.htm">Belley</a> in 1178; St. Arthold, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02415a.htm">Belley</a> (d. 1206); St. Stephen of Ch&acirc;tillon, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Die (d. 1213). Many members have been <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a>, among them the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> Carthusian <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and <a href="01258b.htm">Bl. Nicolo Albergati</a>, <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bologna. There have been about seventy Carthusian <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, including a few <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. There has never been a Carthusian <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>.</p>

<p>Guibert mentions the richness of the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of the <em>chartreuse</em> (see I), and in his "Consuetudines" Guigo writes, "We desire that books be looked after most carefully as the continual food of our souls, and that they be written [<em>fieri</em>] with the utmost diligence, so that we may preach the Word of God by the work of our hands, since we cannot do so with our mouths", and again, "we teach writing to almost all whom we receive" (P.L., CLIII, 693). Throughout the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the Carthusians were famous copyists. <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> himself was the first Carthusian author, writing commentaries on the Psalms and on <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> (v. L&ouml;bbel, op. cit. <em>infra</em>, 179-241). He was followed by Guigo, who, besides the "Consuedines", wrote "Meditations" and a "Life of <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> of <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>". Writers of the order have mostly treated of <a href="14613a.htm">ascetics</a> and <a href="14621a.htm">mystical theology</a>. The following are among the more famous: Ludolf of Saxony (d. after 1340), the author of a well known "Vita Christi"; Henry of Xalkar (d. 1408), who converted Gerhard Groot; Denis the Carthusian (d. 1471), the <em>Doctor Ecstatims</em> whose works are now being edited by the order in 45 vols.; Lanspergius (d., 1539); <a href="14343c.htm">Surius</a> (d. 1578), whose "Vitae" still form a useful supplement to the <a href="02630a.htm">Bollandists'</a> unfinished "Acta"; Nicholas Molin (d. 1638); Petreius (d. 1640); Innocent Le Masson (d. 1703); Le Couteulx (d. 1709); Tromby, who flourished c. 1783, all historians of the order. The first book printed at a charterhouse was issued from the presses of the Seliola Dei near <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> in 1477. The modern printing works of the order were transferred in 1901 from the <em>chartreuse</em> of Montreuil to Tournai.</p>

<h2 id="section7">English province</h2>

<p>The first English charterhouse was founded at Witham in Somerset by King Henry II in 1178, the tenth and last by Henry V in 1414 at Sheen. At the time of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII's</a> breach with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, especially those of the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> charterhouse (founded 1370), offered a stanch resistance. The fourth of May, 1535, is memorable for the deaths of the Protomartyrs of the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, the Bridgettine Monk Richard Reynolds, and the three Carthusian Priors, <a href="08465a.htm">John Houghton</a> of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, Robert Lawrence of Beauvale, and Augustus Webster of Axholme. During the next five years, fifteen of the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> Carthusians perished on the scaffold or were starved to death in Newgate Gaol. On Mary's accession nineteen <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> belonging to various houses gathered at Sheen under <a href="03645b.htm">Prior Maurice Chauncy</a>, a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> Charterhouse, who, to his lasting sorrow, had lost the crown of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> by taking the Oath of Supremacy. The restoration was short-lived, for on Mary's death the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were once more driven into exile. <a href="03645b.htm">Prior Chauncy</a> (died in 1581, but the English community kept together in different parts of the Low Countries with varying fortunes, until the charterhouse of Sheen Anglorum at Nieuport, with a community of six choir <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and two <em>donn&eacute;s</em>, was suppressed by <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> in 1783. The last prior, Father Williams, died at Little Malvern Court, 2 June, 1797. His papers, the seal of Sheen Anglorum, and various <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> are now in the possession of the Carthusians of Parkminster. A charterhouse was founded at Perth in 1429 by King James I of <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, and a short-lived foundation was made at Kinalehin in South Connaught in 1280, being abandoned by the order in 1321.</p>

<h2 id="section8">Carthusian nuns</h2>

<p>In the Priorship of St. Antheim, about 1245, the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the ancient Abbey of Pr&eacute;bayon asked to be received into the order, and Blessed John of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Prior of Montrieux, was ordered to adapt the Carthusian Rule to their needs. The <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> have never been numerous. Two <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> were founded in the twelfth century, nine in the thirteenth, and four in the fourteenth, but of all these only nine were in existence in 1400. In 1690 when Innocent Le Masson published the "Statuts des Moniales" there were only five, four of which were in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and one near <a href="03005a.htm">Bruges</a>; the last was suppressed by <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> in 1783, and the others disappeared in the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. In 1820 the surviving <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> reassembled at Lozier (Isere), and finally settled in 1822 at Beauregard, some miles from the Grande Chartreuse. Thence foundations were made in 1854 at Bastide-Saint-Pierre (Tarn-et-Garonne), and in 1870 at Notre-Dame du Gard near Amiens. The <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> are still at Beauregard, but the rest are in exile at Burdine in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and at San Francesco, and Motta Grossa near <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>. The total number of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> is about 140, of whom 90 are "consecrated".</p>

<p>The Carthusian <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> have always been famed for their regularity and fervour. Convents which had become lax were cut off from the order by the general chapter. The small number of <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> is explained not only by the severity of the rule, but also by the great reluctance to accept new houses always displayed by the order. In 1368 the acceptance of new houses was forbidden by the general chapter, and this prohibition was frequently reiterated. The life of the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> is very similar to that of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, with certain exceptions. They have single rooms instead of separate dwellings, two recreations every day, eat together daily, are not bound to wear the <em>cilicium</em>, and if ill are cared for in an infirmary. They are allowed eight hours sleep. Eleven hours daily are given to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and meditation, as well as work for the poor or for the church. The arrangement of their Office is practically that of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. Perpetual enclosure has been practised since the thirteenth century, and visitors are only received at a grille and in the presence of another <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a>. Each <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> is divided into two distinct parts:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> proper with the cells and conventual offices;</li><li>the dwelling of the two <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, who are known as the vicar and the coadjutor. These two direct the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and have two or three <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> to serve them. The two fathers live exactly as if in a charterhouse, attending Office in stalls placed in the sanctuary of the church, which is divided from the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns'</a> choir by a curtained grille.</li></ul></div>

<p>The <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> are subject to the general chapter which appoints the vicar. They elect their own <a href="12428a.htm">prioress</a>, though the vicar has the first voice in the election; the <a href="12428a.htm">prioresses</a> must consult the vicar in all important matters and, like the <a href="12427c.htm">priors</a>, are bound to tender their resignation to each general chapter.</p>

<p>The habit is the same as that of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, with the exception of the hood, for which a veil is substituted &#151; white for the young religious, and black for the "consecrated" <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. According to the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> the <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> should be solemn, but since the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> they have been regarded as simple by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. No <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> is received. The Carthusian <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> have retained the privilege of the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of virgins, which they have inherited from the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Pr&eacute;bayon. The <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, which is given four years after the <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> are taken, can only be conferred by the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. The rite differs but slightly from that given in the "Pontifical". The <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a> is invested with a crown, ring, stole and <a href="09601b.htm">maniple</a>, the last being worn on the right arm. These ornaments the <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a> only wears again on the day of her monastic jubilee, and after her death on her bier. It is a <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a> who sings the Epistle at the conventual Mass, though without wearing the maniple. At <a href="10050a.htm">Matins</a>, if no <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> be present, a <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a> assumes the <a href="14301a.htm">stole</a> and reads the Gospel. There are also lay sisters, <em>Donn&eacute;es</em>, and <em>Saeurs Touricres</em>. Famous among Carthusian <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> have been <a href="13192a.htm">St. Roseline</a> of Villeneuve and Bl. <a href="02375a.htm">Beatrix</a> of Ornacieus.</p>
