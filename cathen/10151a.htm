<p>Collaborator and friend of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, born at Bretten (in Unterpfalz, now <a href="02194a.htm">Baden</a>), 16 February, 1497; died at <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, 19 April, 1560.</p>

<h2 id="section1">His rearing and education</h2>

<p>Melancthon was of respectable and well-to-do parentage. His father, Georg Schwarzerd (Schwarzert) was a celebrated armourer, while his <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and intelligent mother was the daughter of Reuter, the burgomaster of Bretten. He received his first instruction at home from a private tutor, and in 1507 he went to Pforzheim, where he lived with his grandmother Elizabeth, sister of the great <a href="07538b.htm">humanist</a>, Johann Reuchlin. Here the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, Georg Simler, made him acquainted with the Greek and Latin poets, and with the philosophy of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. But of greater influence still was his intercourse with Reuchlin, his grand-uncle, who gave a strong impetus to his studies. It was Reuchlin also who persuaded him to translate his name Schwarzerd into the Greek Melancthon, (written Melanthon after 1531). In 1509 Melancthon, not yet 13 years of age, entered the <a href="07196a.htm">University of Heidelberg</a>. This institution had already passed its <a href="07538b.htm">humanistic</a> prime under Dalberg and Agricola (see <a href="07538b.htm">HUMANISM</a>). It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that Pallas Spangel, Melancthon's eminent teacher, was also familiar with <a href="07538b.htm">humanists</a> and <a href="07538b.htm">humanism</a>, but he was nonetheless an able scholastic and adherent of <a href="14698b.htm">Thomism</a>. Melancthon studied rhetoric under Peter Gunther, and <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a> under Conrad Helvetius, a pupil of Caesarius. Meanwhile he continued eagerly his private studies, the reading of ancient poets and historians as well as of the neo-Latins, grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics. He obtained the baccalaureate in 1511, but his application for the master's degree in 1512 was rejected because of his youth. He therefore went to T&uuml;bingen, where the scientific spirit was in full vigour, and he became there a pupil of the celebrated Latinist Heinrich Bebel, and, for a second time, of Georg Simler, who was then teaching humanities in T&uuml;bingen, and was later professor of <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. He studied <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a> and <a href="02018e.htm">astrology</a> under Stoffler. With Franciscus Stadianus he planned an edition of the genuine text of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, but nothing ever came of this. His thirst for <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> led him into <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, mathematics, and even medicine.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1514 he won the master's degree as first among eleven candidates, and he was made an instructor in the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. His subjects were Vergil and Terence; later he was assigned the lectureship on eloquence and expounded Cicero and Livy. He also became (1514) press-corrector in the printing office of Thomas Anshelm, pursued his private studies, and at last turned to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. For the antiquated scholastic methods of this <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> as taught at <a href="15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, and for Dr. Jacob Lemp, who, as Melancthon said, had attempted to picture <a href="05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a> on the blackboard, he had, later on, only words of derision. He studied patristics on his own account and took up the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in the original text, but did not at this time reach any definite <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> view; in this branch of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as he himself afterwards repeatedly declared, his <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> father was <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>. He naturally took Reuchlin's part in the latter's controversy with the Cologne professors (see <a href="07538b.htm">HUMANISM</a>), and wrote in 1514 a preface to the "Epistolae clarorum virorum"; but he did not come prominently to the fore. His own earliest publications were an edition of Terence (1516), and a Greek grammar (1518). In 1518 he was offered, on Reuchlin's recommendation, a professorship of Greek at <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. "I know of no one among the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> who is superior to him", wrote Reuchlin to the Elector of Saxony, "save only <a href="05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> Roterodamus, and he is a dutchman". The first impression made by the simple, bashful and frail-looking youth was not favourable. But his opening address: "De corrigendis adolescentiae studiis" (29 Aug., 1518), elicited enthusiastic applause. He extolled the return to the authentic sources of genuine <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> as a signal merit of the new <a href="07538b.htm">humanistic</a> and scientific spirit, and he promised to apply this method to the study of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Melancthon and the German Reformation</h2>

<p><a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> was a strong believer in making <a href="07538b.htm">humanism</a> serve the cause of the "Gospel", and it was not long before the still plastic Melancthon fell under the sway of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> powerful <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>. He accompanied the latter to his Leipzig disputation in 1519; though he did not participate in the discussion itself, he seconded with his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> preparatory labours. After the disputation he composed, with the co-operation of <a href="11213a.htm">&OElig;colampadius</a>, a report which was the occasion of an attack upon him by <a href="05271b.htm">Eck</a> to whom he replied with his "Defensio Phil. Melancthonis contra Joh. Eckium professorem". He was now persuaded by <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> to take up <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> lectures, and became in 1519 a Bachelor of Theology, then a professor of the same <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. For 42 years he laboured at <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> in the very front rank of <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> professors. His <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> courses were followed by 500 or 600, later by as many as 1500 students, whereas his philological lectures were often but poorly attended. Yet he persistently refused the title of Doctor of Divinity, and never accepted <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>; nor was he ever known to preach. His desire was to remain a <a href="07538b.htm">humanist</a>, and to the end of his life he continued his work on the classics, along with his <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> studies. And yet he became the father of evangelical <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. He composed the first treatise on "evangelical" <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (Loci communes rerum theologicarum, 1521). It deals principally with practical religious questions, <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and grace, law and gospel, justification and regeneration. This work ran through more than 100 editions before his death. He was a friend and supporter of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> the Reformer, and defended him, e.g., against the <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Thomas Radinus of <a href="12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, and the Sorbonne in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1521).</p>

<p>But he was not qualified to play the part of a leader amid the turmoil of a troublous period. The life which he was fitted for was the quiet existence of the scholar. He was always of a retiring and timid disposition, temperate, prudent, and peace-loving, with a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> turn of mind and a deeply religious training. He never completely lost his attachment for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and for many of her ceremonies. His limitations first became apparent when, during <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> stay on the Wartburg, 1521, he found himself in <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> confronted with the task of maintaining order against the Zwickau fanatics, with their wild notions as to the establishment of <a href="08646a.htm">Christ's Kingdom upon earth</a>, communism and so forth. What <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> accomplished in a few days on his return had proved impossible to Melancthon. On the other hand he showed his ability as an organizer when he undertook the reorganization of Church affairs in Saxony which then appeared to be in a very bad state. For the visitations ordered by the Elector, Melancthon drew up the "Instructions for Visitors of the parochial clergy" (printed, 1528), which work is remarkable for its practical sense and simplicity. Here also appears the difference between <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> and Melancthon, for Melancthon warns against reviling <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> or <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; whereas <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> remarks: "You must denounce vehemently the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and its followers, for it is already doomed by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> even as the devil and his kingdom". Melancthon, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, preached the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> alone justifies and that "God will forgive <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> for the sake of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and without works on our part"; but he added: "We must nevertheless do <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, which <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> has commanded." Later he invariably sought to preserve peace as long as might be possible, and no one took so much to heart as he the break between the churches.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>While <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> in the Smalkaldic Articles (1537), described the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> and other <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> subscribed to this declaration, Melancthon wrote: "My <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> is this, that if he would give due recognition to the Gospel, his supremacy over the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which he enjoys by human consent (not by Divine ordinance) should also be acknowledged by us for the sake of peace and of the unity of those <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> who are now, and in the future may be, subject to him." He had made a diplomatic plea for the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> at the Reichstag in Speyer (1529). He hoped that it would be recognized without difficulty by the emperor and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party, but instead of this, a resolution was adopted to carry out vigorously the Edict of Worms (1521) which prohibited all innovations. The evangelical element, "a small handful," protested against this (whence the name, "Protestants"), and Melancthon felt grave concern over this "terrible state of things". At a religious conference with the <a href="15772a.htm">Zwinglians</a> in Marburg (autumn of 1529), he joined hands with <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> in opposing a union with <a href="15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>. The latter's views on the Eucharist seemed to him an "impious <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>". Melancthon composed for the Reichstag of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> (1530) the Augsburg Confession (confessio Augustana) in which he aimed to prove that the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, in spite of the innovations, still belonged to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and had a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to remain in her fold. To this end he alleged in defence of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the Scriptures and statements of recognized <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authorities. The innovations in question were represented as merely a reformation of abuses which had crept into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The tenor of the Confession in general and its wording in particular, were the work of Melancthon. <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> saw its outline and gave it his approval. It received numerous additions and changes at <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and its final form was determined by common agreement of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> from all the evangelical bodies.</p>

<p>Melancthon's desire for peace appears even in this basic document of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and he has often been reproached with lack of vigour in his opposition to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> himself explained (only, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, after the hopes of obtaining for the Confession the ear of the emperor and of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> vain), that he had no intention of showing "servile submission", and that he regretted the omission of an attack on <a href="12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, the veneration of the Saints and the Papacy. The formal merits of the Confession, its simple, clear, calm, and terse statement of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> won the unanimous praise of the Evangelical party. His "masterful clearness and vigorous <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>" were also admired in the "Apology" for the Augsburg Confession, which is more decided in tone because written at a later date (when Melancthon himself had determined "to throw aside moderation") and directed against the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "Confutatio". On the other hand, Melancthon was sharply criticized for his personal conduct in the Reichstag, for his apprehension and concern, his failure to take a firm and dignified attitude against the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party. He himself once declared, in justification of his course: "I <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that the people decry our moderation; but it does not become us to heed the clamour of the multitude. We must labour for peace and for the future It will prove a great blessing for us all if unity be restored in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>." He feared the overthrow of all order. Hence he made decided concessions to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at the subsequent conferences and debates on religion. He seems to have been lured by some dream of an Evangelical-Catholic <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He thought it possible to remain within the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, even with the new <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. But he was never a Cryptocatholic, as has been laid to his charge, and while evincing in every other way a spirit of reconciliation, he held fast to the "purified doctrine", and repeatedly qualified as <a href="02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> the lending of a hand, even in the cause of peace, to any suppression of the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>The story that when his mother asked which was the better of the two <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a>, he replied that the modified one was the more plausible, while the old one was the surer, is nothing but a ridiculous invention. His attempt to bring about a reconciliation between the two brought him, instead of thanks, only <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> and abuse. From the age of 30 to that of 50, Melancthon was at the height of his career as spokesman and advocate of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, which, as had formerly been the case in <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a> and <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, was introduced under his guidance into Wurtemberg, <a href="02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a>, and Saxony. He never absented himself from a convention of <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> or statesmen, but found himself differing from <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> on many points, for as time went on Melancthon emancipated himself more and more from <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> teaching. More eventful still and more painful was the last portion of his life, following the death of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> (1546). He rejected the Augsburg Interim (1548) which was to regulate Church affairs until they should be definitively settled by the Council, on the ground that it did not harmonize with Evangelical principles. On the other hand he was prevailed upon to take part in a conference for a modified interim, the so-called Leipzig Interim, and he addressed on this occasion a letter (28 April, 1548) to Minister Carlowitz, of Saxony, which once more provoked bitter criticism. He lamented therein the thraldom in which he had been held by the <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, and again showed himself favourable to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system of church organization and was even ready to accept <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practices, though he desired to hold fast to the "evangelical" doctrines.</p>

<p>A result of this Adiaphora controversy, in which Melancthon declared <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> practices adiaphorous (indifferent things, neither good nor bad), hence permissible provided that the proper <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> were maintained and its import made clear to the people. Matthias Flacius Illyricus and other zealots objected that these practices had heretofore been the centres of impiety and <a href="14339a.htm">superstition</a>, and Melancthon was attacked and reviled by Flacius, Amsdorf, and the other "Gnesiolutherans", as a renegade and a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>. The <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> met at Weimar in 1556, and declared their adhesion to <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> teaching as to <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> and the Last Supper. Melancthon participated in the religious discussion which took place at Worms, in 1557, between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>. His <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> opponents' behaviour toward him here <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> grossly insulting. The last ten years of his life (1550-60) were almost completely taken up with <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> wrangles (adiaphoristic, osiandric, stankaristic, majoristic, <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a>, and cryptocalvinistic) and with attempts to compose these various differences. He continued in spite of all to labour for his Church and for her peace. But one readily understands why, a few days before he died, he gave as a reason for not fearing death: "thou shalt be freed from the <a href="14580a.htm">theologians'</a> fury (<em>a rabie theologorum</em>)." His last wish was that the Churches might become reunited in Christ. He died <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a>, quietly and peacefully, without apparent struggle.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Melancthon as a theologian</h2>

<p>Melancthon considered it his mission to bring together the religious thoughts of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, to coordinate them and give them a clear and intelligible form. He did not feel himself called upon to seek out their original premises or to speculate on their <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> results. His <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> bears the substantial impress of his <a href="07538b.htm">humanistic</a> thought, for he saw in ancient philosophy a precursor of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and sought to reconcile it with <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> Revelation. Even in <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> he took up whatever adapted itself most easily to the general trend of <a href="07538b.htm">humanistic</a> <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> thought, and his dogmatic departures from <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> were a softening of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. His <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> system is contained in the "Loci Communes", as revised by him; in substance it was brought to completion by the edition of 1535. As late as 1521 he had upheld the harsh tenets of fatalism with regard to all events and of determinism with regard to the human will. He subsequently gave "Synergism" his support, as against the deterministic tendency of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. That <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not the cause of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that man is responsible for his acts, must be firmly maintained. Man's <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> can only be wrought out with the cooperation of his own will, although there can be no question of merit on his part. Likewise he emphasized the necessity of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> from the practical, <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> standpoint. He went so far as to say, in the Loci of 1535, that <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> are <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for eternal life, inasmuch as they must necessarily follow reconciliation with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. This was again attenuated later on: what is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, he said, is a new spiritual life or sense of <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>. i.e., a righteous <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As years went by he even abandoned <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as to the Last Supper, and looked on <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> spiritual communication of Himself to the faithful and their internal union with Him as the essential feature of the Sacrament; i.e., he inclined towards <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> theory. In 1560 his teachings were introduced into all the churches of Saxony, through the "Corpus Philippicum" (a collection of Melancthonian <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> writings). But there came a change fourteen years after his death. The Philippists or Crypto-Calvinists were thrown into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> and sent into exile. They subsequently identified themselves more and more with <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, even on the question of <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a>. <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, narrow and harsh, won the day with its Formula of Concord (1580). So strong indeed was the opposition that the saying ran: better a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> than a <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>. From that time on until well into the eighteenth century, Melancthon's memory was assailed and reviled, even in <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. It is said that Leonard Hutter, the leading <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> there at the beginning of the seventeenth century, was so enraged by an appeal to Melancthon as an authority, made in the course of a public disputation, that he had the latter's portrait torn down from the wall and trampled underfoot before the eyes of all. It was not until the period of the Enlightenment that Melancthon was again appreciated and recognized as the real founder of a German-Evangelical <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. Indeed, he carried his labours into all the other <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> fields, in some of which he worked as a pioneer, while in all he toiled at least as a contributor. He promoted the study of the Scriptures not only by his own active work thereon from first to last, but also by his teachings and by his exhortations to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Like <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, he laid particular stress on the necessity of a thorough philological training, as well as of a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of history and archaeology, for the proper interpretation of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. He assisted <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> constantly in his <a href="06517a.htm">German</a> translation of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, and also, it is said, in the production of the Latin translation which appeared at <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, in 1529. In <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> he stood out vigorously for one sense, and that the literal, (<em>sensus literalis</em>), as against the "four senses" of the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. Beyond this, he held, there was nothing to be sought in the words of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> save the dogmatic and practical applications and development. His commentaries on the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are not as important as those which he wrote on the New. The most noteworthy are those on the Epistle to the Romans and the Colossians, which have been published repeatedly. These are largely given to the discussion of facts and of dogmatic and polemical matters, and they have considerable influence on the history of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> doctrines. The impulse also which he gave to the study of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> by historical methods, was felt for a long time. In his handling of the Chronicle of Cario he treated of the <a href="07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> jointly with that of the state, and thereby set an example which found many imitators. He was also the first to attempt a history of <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, and led the way in <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> biography. In homiletics he was early recognized as the originator of a more methodical form of <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> oratory, as contrasted with the "heroic" sermons of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>. He did not himself appear as a preacher, but was content with expounding selections from the Gospel on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Feast-days, in his house or in a lecture hall, using for this purpose the Latin tongue for the benefit of the Hungarian students who did not understand the German sermons preached in church. This was the origin of his "Postillen" (<a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a>). Finally he was the author of the first <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> treatise on the method of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> study.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Melancthon as professor and pedagogue</h2>

<p>Melancthon was the embodiment of the entire <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture of his time. His learning covered all the branches of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as it then existed, and what is more remarkable, he possessed the gift of imparting his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> always in the simplest, clearest and most practical form. On this account the numerous manuals and guides to the Latin and Greek grammars, to dialectics, rhetoric, ethics, physics, politics, and history, which he produced in addition to his many editions of, and commentaries on, classical authors, were quickly adopted, and were retained for more than a century. The exposition shows the utmost care; the style is natural and clear. In his academic training also, he disdained all rhetorical devices. His power lay not in brilliant oratory, but in clearness and in the choice of the most appropriate expression (proprietas sermonis). He did not look upon learning and literature as ends in themselves, but as means for inculcating morality and religion. The union of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with the spirit of religion, of <a href="07538b.htm">humanism</a> with the "Gospel", was ever the keynote of his public activity, and through him it became for centuries the <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> ideal of "Evangelical" <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, even, in a certain sense, of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> as a whole. It is not easy therefore to overrate Melancthon's importance in this field. By this many-sided practical activity and his work as an organizer he became the founder of higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in "Evangelical" <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; the elementary <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> lay outside his sphere. Numerous Latin <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> owed to him their establishment or reorganization; and in numberless cases he was written to for advice, or was called on to recommend competent instructors, to settle controversies, or to give his opinion on the advantage or necessity of courses of study. His <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> on teaching in the three-class Latin <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> are more fully set forth in the "Unterricht der Visitatoren" (1528) already referred to, and the "Wittenberger Kirchen-und Schulordnung" (1533). Their novelty lies partly in the selection of subjects, but chiefly in the method. Latin naturally holds the place of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<p>Melancthon put an end to grammatical torture and the "Doctrinale" of Alexander de Villa Dei; grammar exercises were appended to the texts. He himself had a Latin <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, the Schola Privata, in his own house for ten years, in which he prepared a few boys for the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1526, he founded a second grade of the more advanced <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, the Obere Schule, in Nuremburg near St. Aegidien. He looked on this as a connecting link between the Latin <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> and the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. It comprised dialectics and rhetoric, readings from the poets, mathematics, and Greek. This type of <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, however, did not meet with any great success. The reorganization of <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, as advocated by Melancthon, affected chiefly the arts and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> courses. The <a href="01757a.htm">faculty of Arts</a> became wholly <a href="07538b.htm">humanistic</a>. <a href="09324a.htm">Logic</a>, till then dominant in <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, gave way to the languages, and Greek and Hebrew assumed more prominence. As sources of philology the classic authors replaced the writers of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. For the scholastic study of the liberal arts a more simple and practical course in dialectics and rhetoric was substituted. Likewise in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Scriptural interpretation was brought to the fore. Dogmatic principles were developed by <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a>; to these were gradually added special lectures on <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>. The essential fact was a decided return to original sources. This transformation was wrought not only in the <a href="15678b.htm">University of Wittenberg</a>, but also in that of T&uuml;bingen, where Melancthon himself took part in the work of reform, in those of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, Leipzig, <a href="13205b.htm">Rostock</a>, and Heidelberg, where in 1557 he took part in the deliberations concerning the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>. Wherever he could not appear in person he sent his advice in writing, while his disciples, for whom he obtained professorships taught in accordance with his ideals and his method. The new <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> of Marburg (1527), Konigsberg (1544), and Jena (1548), which were founded under the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, also found in Melancthon a guide and a counsellor. Hence his title "Praeceptor Germaniae".</p>
