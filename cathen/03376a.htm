<p>(Also called <font size=-2>DE</font> M<font size=-2>IRANDA,</font> from his native town).</p>

<p><a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo; b. at Miranda de Arga, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1503; d. at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 2 May, 1576. Carranza belonged to a noble <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> which had its estates at Miranda de Arga in Spanish Navarre. He received his early <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> and in 1520 entered the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Benalaque near <a href="07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a>. He continued his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at Salamanca; in 1528 he was made master of the liberal arts, and in 1534 <a href="09111a.htm">lector</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, at the College of St. Gregory, Valladolid. On account of some <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> opinions he was said to hold, an accusation was about this time brought against him, but nothing further came of it. Carranza's reputation as a learned <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> increased rapidly, and he was appointed censor by the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> and was commissioned to prepare opinions and sermons. He was also sent by his order on various important missions. Thus in 1539 he represented his province at the general chapter of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After his return, in 1540, the <a href="03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> offered him the <a href="04580c.htm">See of Cuzco</a> in <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>, but Carranza declined the appointment and continued performing his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="09111a.htm">lector</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Valladolid. In 1545, when the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> was opened, <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a> sent Carranza and another <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Dominicus <a href="14152a.htm">de Soto</a>, as imperial <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, to the council, and by June, 1545, Carranza was in <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a>. During the first period of the council (1545-47) he took an active part in the discussions of the <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> in the congregations, expressed opinions concerning the various matters appointed for discussion, the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in general, Baptism, the Eucharist, and the <a href="10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, and preached at Divine service, 14 March, before the assembled council (Le Plat, "Monum. Trident.", I, 52-62, gives the text of the sermon). He also showed great <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the conferences concerning the reform of church discipline. In the warm discussions as to the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of episcopal residence, Carranza, like all the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, was strongly of the opinion that the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of residence was a <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a> (<em>juris divini</em>), and therefore could not be <a href="04696b.htm">delegated</a> to a vicar. On this question, Carranza wrote and issued a treatise, "Controversia de necessarii residentii personali episcoporum et aliorum inferiorum ecclesi&aelig; pastorum Tridenti explicata" (Venice, 1547), which may be found in Le Plat, "Monum. Trident.", III, 522-584. Carranza also had a share in drawing up the eleven articles proposed by the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, which treated the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of episcopal residence and other questions of discipline relating to the office of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. When the council was transferred to Bologna he did not go to that city, but remained in <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a>. In 1548 Charles asked him to accompany Prince Philip to <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a> as confessor, but Carranza declined the position; in 1549 he refused the appointment of <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="03243a.htm">Canary Islands</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>After his return to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1549, he was made <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, and in 1550 provincial. In 1551, when <a href="08564a.htm">Pope Julius III</a> reopened the <a href="15030c.htm">Council at Trent</a>, Carranza went once more to that city to take part in the deliberations. The council was again interrupted in 1552, and Carranza went back to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where, besides his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> in his order, he also took part in the labours of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. As almoner of Prince Philip, Carranza came in contact with the prince, and often preached before him and his court. When, in 1554, Philip was <a href="02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to <a href="09766a.htm">Queen Mary of England</a>, and was preparing to go to that country for the marriage, he sent Carranza and other members of Spanish orders ahead of him, in order to give support to the queen in her efforts to bring back the country to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Carranza remained until 1557 in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, where he was actively engaged, in connexion with <a href="12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, as visitator and preacher. He sought to prevent the sale of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> books, preached frequently against the <a href="07256b.htm">false doctrines</a>, and made an inspection of the <a href="11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a>, from which, by his efforts, a number of professors were expelled. After <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a> had abdicated the throne and was succeeded, in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, by Philip, Carranza returned, in 1557, to the Continent, and went to <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, where the new king had his principal residence at that time. In <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a> the <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> also busied himself with efforts to check the introduction and spread of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writings and to maintain the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>.</p>

<p>The See of Toledo falling vacant by the death of the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> Siliceo, 31 May, 1557, the king decided upon Carranza as successor to the position. In vain did Carranza exert himself to win the favour of the king for another candidate. Philip II persisted in his choice, so that at last Carranza yielded and was <a href="12376a.htm">preconized</a> by <a href="11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a>, 16 December, 1557, as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo and, therefore, <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Carranza received episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, in 1558, from <a href="06727a.htm">Cardinal Granvella</a>, then <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01752c.htm">Arras</a>. Equipped with important political instructions the new <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> left <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a> in June and reached the court at Valladolid in August. Soon after this he went to Yuste to visit <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, who was dying; he remained with the emperor until the latter's death. A report arose in time that Carranza had led Charles into <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> views, so that the emperor had not died in the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. This rumour was pure invention, but it gave a new ground for the process before the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> which had already begun against him. It was only for about a year that Carranza was able to devote himself to his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, where he bestowed especial attention upon the care of the poor. In 1558 his "Commentary on the Christian Catechism" (Commentarios del revmo. Se&ntilde;. Fray Bartolom&eacute; Carranza de Miranda sobre el catechismo cristiano) had appeared at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. A number of views suspected of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> were found in the book, and the Grand Inquisitor Vald&eacute;s brought an action against the author. Besides this work on the <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a>,Carranza's <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, expressions he had employed in sermons, and letters found in his possession, including one from Juan Vald&eacute;s, the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>, were taken as evidence against him. Melchior Cano, the famous <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and Dominicus <a href="14152a.htm">de Soto</a>, both members of the same order as the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, drew numerous propositions from the commentary which were open to <a href="03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censure</a>. A <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 January, 1559, had granted the Grand Inquisitor of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> the power, for the space of two years, to investigate the conduct of all <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; this measure was intended to counteract the threatening danger of the spread of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. With the permission, therefore, of King Philip II (26 June, 1558) the grand inquisitor had the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> arrested at Torrelaguna, 22 August, 1558, and brought a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to Valladolid. <a href="12129a.htm">Pope Pius IV</a> made repeated requests to Philip II in the matter, and the Holy Father was urged several times, in the years 1562 and 1563, by the members of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, to bring the case of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo before his court. The Congregation of the Index also gave at the council a favourable testimony for Carranza in regard to his commentary.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Nevertheless the Spanish process pursued its tedious course. In 1564, when the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> had closed its investigation, the king expressed the wish to <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> that the matter be decided in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> by judges appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed to this and named (13 July, 1565) four judges who were to pronounce judgment in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. These judges were: Cardinal Ugo Buoncompagni, Ippolito Aldobrandini, Fel. Peretti, O. S. F., and J. B. Castagna, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13203a.htm">Rossano</a>; all four became <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> later. However, after their arrival in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in November, 1565, they were not permitted to proceed independently of the officials of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and the process, therefore, reached no final settlement. At last, in 1567, owing to the peremptory order of <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, the suit was brought before the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>, the official documents were sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Carranza, who had been in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> eight years, was taken to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he arrived 28 May, 1567. The <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> chambers in the Castle of Sant' Angelo were appointed to be his residence during the trial. Once more the case lasted a long time, being nine years before the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a>. It was not until the reign of <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> that a final decision was reached, 14 April, 1576. Carranza was not found guilty of actual <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but he was condemned to <a href="01044d.htm">abjure</a> sixteen <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> propositions of which he had made himself suspected, was forbidden to enter on the government of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> for another five years, and was ordered during this period to live in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of his order near the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, and there to perform certain religious exercises as penance. Carranza died, however, in the same year, and was buried in the choir of the church just mentioned. Before this he had, on 23 April, visited the seven great churches and had celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> on the following day in the basilica of the Lateran. Previous to receiving the last <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> he touchingly declared that he had been all his life a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> adherent of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, that he had never <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> understood and held the condemned propositions in a <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> sense, and that he submitted entirely to the judgment pronounced upon him. He had borne the <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of nearly seventeen years with patience and resignation, and was universally <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> gave permission for the placing over his grave of a monument bearing an inscription in his <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<p>Carranza's sorrowful fate was brought about, largely, by the intense desire to keep all <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> influences out of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. At the same time it cannot be denied that expressions which he used and propositions which he occasionally set forth would of themselves give rise to the suggestion of <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions. At a later date the Congregation of the Index also condemned his commentary. This work, a stout folio, treated the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrines</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> under four heads: <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, commandments, <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>. Besides the commentary, Carranza published a "Summa Conciliorum et Pontificum a Petro usque Paulum III" (Venice, 1546), often republished and enlarged by later editors. The "Summa" was prefaced by four dissertations: "Controversi&aelig; quattuor, (1) Quanta sit auctoritas traditionum in ecclesi&#226;; (2) Quanta Sacr&aelig; Scriptur&aelig; (3) Quanta Romani Pontificis et Sedis apostolic&aelig; (4) Quanta Conciliorum"; further, by the controversial treatise concerning episcopal residence mentioned above, and by an "Introduction to the Hearing of the Mass" (Instruccion para oir messa). An edition was issued at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1555.</p>
