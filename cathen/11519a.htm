<p>(PASSAVIENSIS)</p>

<p>Located in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, suffragan of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich-Freising</a>, including within its boundaries one district and one <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> in Upper <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and the City of Passau and 10 districts in Lower <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (see <a href="06484b.htm">GERMANY</a>, <em>Map</em>).</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Passau may be considered the successor of the ancient Diocese of Lorch (<em>Laureacum</em>). At Lorch, a Roman station and an important stronghold at the junction of the Enns and the Danube, <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> found a foothold in the third century, during a period of Roman domination, and a <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lorch certainly existed in the fourth. During the great migrations, <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> on the Danube was completely rooted out, and the Celtic and Roman population was annihilated or enslaved. In the region between the Lech and the Enns, the wandering Bajuvari were <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the seventh century, while the Avari, to the east, remained <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was brought about by <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, who, with the support of Duke Odilo, erected the four sees of Freising, <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Passau, and <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. He confirmed as incumbent of Passau, Bishop Vivilo, or Vivolus, who had been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="06789a.htm">Pope Gregory III</a>, and who was for a long time the only <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Thenceforth, Vivilo resided permanently at Passau, on the site of the old Roman colony of Batavis. Here was a church, the founder of which is not known, dedicated to <a href="14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a>. To Bishop Vivilo's <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was annexed the ancient Lorch, which meanwhile had become a small and unimportant place. By the duke's generosity, a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was soon erected near the Church of St. Stephen, and here the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> lived in common with his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The boundaries of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> extended westwards to the Isar, and eastwards to the Enns. In <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs Passau was probably, from the beginning, suffragan to Salzburg. Through the favour of Dukes Odilo and Tassilo, the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> received many costly gifts, and several <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> arose &mdash; e.g. Niederalteich, Niebernburg, Mattsee, Kremsm&uuml;nster &mdash; which were richly endowed. Under Bishop Waltreich (774-804), after the conquest of the Avari, who had assisted the rebellious Duke Tassilo, the district between the Enns and the Raab was added to the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which thus included the whole eastern part (Ostmark) of Southern <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and part of what is now <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The first missionaries to the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> Hungarians went out from Passau, and in 866 the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> sent missionaries to <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Passau, the outermost eastern bulwark of the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>, suffered most from the incursions of the Hungarians. At that time many <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were destroyed. When, after the victory of Lech, the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> pressed forward and regained the old Ostmark, Bishop Adalbert (946-971) hoped to extend his <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> over <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. His successor <a href="12099a.htm">Piligrim</a> (971-91), who worked <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> and successfully for the <a href="03712a.htm">Christianization</a> of Pannonia, aspired to free Passau from the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> authority of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, but was completely frustrated in this, as well as in his attempt to assert the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> claims which Passau was supposed to have inherited from Lorch, and to include all <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. By founding many <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> he prepared the way for the princely power of later <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It is undoubtedly to his credit that he built many new churches and restored others from ruins. His successor, Christian (991-1002) received in 999 from <a href="11356a.htm">Otto III</a> the market privilege and the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="11152a.htm">coinage</a>, taxation, and higher and lower <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Henry II granted him a large part of the North Forest. Henceforward, indeed, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> ruled as princes of the empire, although the title was used for the first time only in a document in 1193. Under Berengar (1013-45) the whole district east of the <a href="15417a.htm">Viennese</a> forest as far as Letha and March was placed under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Passau. During his time the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter made its appearance, but there is little information concerning its beginning as a distinct corporation with the right of electing a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This right was much hampered by the exercise of imperial influence.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Conflict of Investures, St. Altmann (q.v.) occupied the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> (1065-91) and was one of the few German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who adhered to <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>. Ulrich I, Count of H&ouml;fft (1092-1121), who was for a time driven from his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> by <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>, furthered the monastic reforms and the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. Reginmar (1121-38), Reginbert, Count of Hegenau (1136-47) who took part in the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> of Conrad III, and Conrad of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1149-64), a brother of Bishop <a href="11358b.htm">Otto of Freising</a>, were all much interested in the foundation of new <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and the reform for those already existing. Ulrich, Count of Andechs (1215-21), was formally recognized as a prince of the empire at the Reichstag of <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> in 1217. The reforms which were begun by Gebhard von Plaien (1221-32) and R&uuml;diger von Rodeck (1233-1250) found a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoter in Otto von Lonsdorf (1254-65), one of the greatest <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Passau. He took stringent measures against the relaxed <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, introduced the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> into his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, promoted the arts and <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and collected the old documents which had survived the storms of the preceding period, so that to him we owe almost all our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the early history of Passau. (See Schmidt, "Otto von Lonsdorf, Bischof zu Passau", <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 1903.) Bishop Peter, formerly Canon of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, contributed much to the greatness of the House of Habsburg by bestowing episcopal fiefs on the sons of King Rudolph. Under Bernhard of Brambach (1285-1313) began the struggles of Passau to become a free imperial city. After an uprising in May, 1298, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> granted the burghers, in the municipal ordinance of 1299, privileges in conformity with what was called the Bernhardine Charter. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> having been burned down in 1281, he built a new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which lasted until 1662. Albert III von Winkel (1363-80) was particularly active in the struggle with the burghers and in resisting the robber-knights. The Black Death visited the <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> under Gottfried II von Weitzenbeck (1342-62). George I von Hohenlohe (1388-1421), who, after 1418, was imperial chancellor, energetically opposed the <a href="07585a.htm">Hussites</a>. During the time of Ulrich III von Nussdorf (1451-79) the diocese suffered its first great curtailment by the formation of the new Diocese of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1468). This <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was afterwards further enlarged at the expense of Passau by <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>. Towards the close of the fifteenth century the conflict between an Austrian candidate for the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> and a <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> brought about a state of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> in the diocese.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was kept out of all the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> part of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, except the Countship of Ortenburg, by the efforts of Ernest of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> who, though never <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, ruled the diocese from 1517 to 1541. The new <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> found many adherents, however, in the Austrian portion. Wolfgang I Count of Salm (1540-55) and Urban von Trennbach (1561-98) led the counter-Reformation. Under Wolfgang the Peace of Passau was concluded, in the summer of 1552 (see <a href="03625a.htm">CHARLES V</a>). The last <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> prince-bishop was Urban, who in his struggles during the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> received substantial aid for the Austrian part of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> from Albert V, Duke of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and, after 1576, from Emperor Rudolph II. All the successors of Urban were Austrians. Bishop Leopold I (1598-1625) (also <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> after 1607) was one of the first to enter the Catholic League of 1609. In the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> he was loyal to his brother, Emperor Ferdinand II. Leopold II Wilhelm (1625-62), son of Ferdinand II, a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> prince and a great benefactor of the City of Passau, especially after the great conflagration of 1662, finally united five <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. Count Wenzelaus von Thun (1664-73) began the new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which was completed thirty years later by Paul Philip of Lamberg. He and his nephew Joseph Dominicus, his mediate successor (1723-62), became <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. When <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> was raised to an archdiocese in 1722, he relinquished the <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> beyond the <a href="15417a.htm">Viennese</a> Forest, hence was exempted from the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> authority of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, and obtained the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> for himself and his successors. Leopold Ernst, Count of Firmian (1763-83), created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1772, established an institute of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Passau and, after the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a>, founded a lyceum. Under Joseph, Count of Auersperg (1783-95), <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> took away two-thirds of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> to form the two <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="09273a.htm">Linz</a> and St. P&ouml;lten (see <a href="09273a.htm">LINZ</a>). The last prince-bishop, Leopold von Thun (1796-1826), saw the secularization of the old <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1803; the City of Passau and the temporalities on the left bank of the Inn and the right bank of the Ilz went to <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, while the territory on the left banks of the Danube and of the Ilz went to the Grand Duchy of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and afterwards to <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. On 22 February, 1803, when the Bavarians marched into Passau, the prince-bishop withdrew to his estates in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and never revisited his former residence.</p>

<p>By the Concordat of 1818, the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was given the boundaries which it still has. After the death of the last prince-bishop, Passau's exemption from <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> power ceased, and the diocese became suffragan of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich-Freising</a>. Bishop Charles Joseph von Riccabona (1826-38) turned his attention to the care of the rising generation of <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. With the support of King Louis I, he founded a preparatory course and then reopened the lyceum with a faculty of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Henry von Hofst&auml;tter (1839-75) established a complete <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for boys. The former of these found a great benefactor in Bishop Franz von Weckert (1875-79); the latter, in Michael von Rampf (1889-1901), who for sixteen years had been <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the Archdiocese of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich-Freising</a>. He was followed by Antonius von Thoma (March-October, 1889), who was promoted to the archiepiscopal See of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and succeeded by Antonius von Henle (1901-06), who was transferred to <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. The present <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, Sigismund Felix von Ow-Felldorf, was appointed 11 January, 1906, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 24 February, 1906.</p>
