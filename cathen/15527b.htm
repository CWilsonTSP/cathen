<p>An <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> which appeared in the second half of the twelfth century and, in a considerably modified form, has survived to the present day.</p>

<h2>Name and origin</h2>

<p>The name was derived from Waldes their founder and occurs also in the variations of <em>Valdesii, Vallenses</em>. Numerous other designations were applied to them; to their profession of extreme poverty they owed the named of "the Poor"; from their place of origin, <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, they were called "Leonistae"; and frequently the two <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> were combined in the title "Poor Men of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>". Their practice of wearing sandals or wooden shoes (sabots) caused them to be named "Sandaliati", "Insabbatati", "Sabbatati", Sabotiers". Anxious to surround their own history and <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> with the halo of antiquity, some Waldenses claimed for their churches an Apostolic origin. The first Waldensian congregations, it was maintained, were established by <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> who, on his journey to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, visited the valleys of <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>. The history of these foundations was identified with that of primitive <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> as long as the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> remained lowly and poor. But in the beginning of the fourth century Pope Sylvester was raised by Constantine, whom he had cured of <a href="09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, to a position of power and wealth, and the Papacy became unfaithful to its mission. Some <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, however, remained true to the Faith and practice of the early days, and in the twelfth century a certain Peter appeared who, from the valleys of the Alps, was called "Waldes". He was not the founder of a new <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, but a missionary among these faithful observers of the genuine <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> law, and he gained numerous adherents. This account was, indeed, far from being universally accredited among the Waldenses; many of them, however, for a considerable period accepted as founded on fact the assertion that they originated in the time of Constantine. Others among them considered Claudius of <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> (died 840), <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius of Tours</a> (died 1088), or other such men who had preceded Waldes, the first representatives of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. The claim of its Constantinian origin was for a long time credulously accepted as valid by <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians. In the nineteenth century, however, it became evident to critics that the Waldensian documents had been tampered with. As a result the pretentious claims of the Waldenses to high antiquity were relegated to the realm of fable.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The real founder of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> was a wealthy merchant of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> who in the early documents is called Waldes (Waldo). To this name is added from 1368 the designation of Peter, assumed by him at his "conversion", or more likely, attributed to him by his followers. Few details concerning his personal history are known; there are extant, however, two important accounts of the complete change in his <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>; one written about 1220 by a <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, usually designated as the "anonymous chronicler of Laon"; the other by a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Friar and Inquisitor <a href="14291a.htm">Stephen of Bourbon</a> (died about 1262), and dates back to about the middle of the thirteenth century. The former writer assigns a prominent place to the influence exercised on Waldes by the history of <a href="01307b.htm">St. Alexius</a>, while the latter makes no mention of it but speaks of his acquaintance with the contents of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> through translations. The history of Waldes's conversion may perhaps be reconstructed in the following manner. Desirous of acquiring a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of biblical teaching, Waldes requested two <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to translate for him the four Gospels. In a similar manner he subsequently obtained translations of other Biblical books and of some writings of the Fathers. Through the reading of these works he was attracted to the practice of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>; his fervour increased when one day he heard from an itinerant singer (<em>ioculator</em>) the history of <a href="01307b.htm">St. Alexius</a>. He now consulted a master of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> on the best and surest way to <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In answer the words of Christ to the rich young man were cited to him: "If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor." (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs21">Matthew 19:21</a>). Waldes immediately put into effect the counsel of the Divine Master. He made over part of his wealth to his wife, part to those from whom he had acquired it, left some to the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Fontevrault in whose <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> he placed his two little daughters, and distributed the greatest part to the poor. On the feast of the Assumption, 1176, he disposed of the last of his earthly possessions and shortly after took the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty. His example created a great stir in <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and soon found imitators, particularly among the lower and uneducated classes. A special confraternity was established for the practice of apostolic poverty. Its members almost immediately began to preach in the streets and public places and gained more adherents. Their preaching, however, was not unmixed with <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> and was consequently prohibited, according to <a href="14291a.htm">Stephen of Bourbon</a>, by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, according to <a href="09635a.htm">Walter Map</a>, present at the assembly, by the Third General Lateran Council (1179). The Waldenses, instead of heeding the prohibition, continued to preach on the plea that obedience is due rather to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> than to man. Pope Lucius III consequently included them among the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> against whom he issued a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> at <a href="15360a.htm">Verona</a> in 1184.</p>

<h2>Doctrine</h2>

<p>The organization of the Waldenses was a reaction against the great splendour and outward display existing in the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church; it was a practical protest against the worldly lives of some contemporary <a href="04049b.htm">churchmen</a>. Amid such <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions the Waldenses made the profession of extreme poverty a prominent feature in their own lives, and emphasized by their practice the need for the much neglected task of preaching. As they were mainly recruited among circles not only devoid of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training, but also lacking generally in <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, it was inevitable that <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> should mar their teaching, and just as inevitable that, in consequence, <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> should put a stop to their evangelistic work. Among the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> which they propagated was the denial of <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, and of <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and <a href="04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>. They denounced all lying as a grievous <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, refused to take <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a> and considered the shedding of human blood unlawful. They consequently condemned <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and the infliction of the <a href="12565a.htm">death penalty</a>. Some points in this teaching so strikingly resemble the <a href="03435a.htm">Cathari</a> that the borrowing of the Waldenses from them may be looked upon as a <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Both <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> also had a similar organization, being divided into two classes, the Perfect (<em>perfecti</em>) and the Friends or Believers (<em>amici</em> or <em>credentes</em>). (See <a href="03435a.htm">CATHARI</a> and <a href="01267e.htm">ALBIGENSES</a>.)</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Among the Waldenses the perfect, bound by the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty, wandered about from place to place preaching. Such an itinerant life was ill-suited for the married state, and to the profession of poverty they added the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity. Married <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who desired to join them were permitted to dissolve their union without the consent of their consort. Orderly government was secured by the additional <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience to superiors. The perfect were not allowed to perform manual labour, but were to depend for their subsistence on the members of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> known as the friends. These continued to live in the world, married, owned <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, and engaged in secular pursuits. Their generosity and <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> were to provide for the material needs of the perfect. The friends remained in union with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and continued to receive its <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> with the exception of penance, for which they sought out, whenever possible, one of their own <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>. The name Waldenses was at first exclusively reserved to the perfect; but in the course of the thirteenth century the friends were also included in the designation. The perfect were divided into the three classes of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, called "major" or "majoralis", preached and administered the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of penance, Eucharist, and order. The celebration of the Eucharist, frequent perhaps in the early period, soon took place only on <a href="10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>. The <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> preached and enjoyed limited faculties for the hearing of confessions. The <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, named "junior" or "minor", acted as assistant to the higher orders and by the collection of <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> relieved them of all material care. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was elected by a joint meeting of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>. In his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, as well as in the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> of the other members of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the laying-on of hands was the principal element; but the recitation of the <a href="09356a.htm">Our Father</a>, so important in the Waldensian liturgy, was also a prominent feature. The <a href="08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a> seems to have been exercised exclusively by one <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, known as the "rector", who was the highest executive officer. Supreme legislative power was vested in the general convention or general chapter, which met once or twice a year, and was originally composed of the perfect but at a later date only of the senior members among them. It considered the general situation of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, examined the religious condition of the individual districts, admitted to the episcopate, <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, or <a href="04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, and pronounced upon the admission of new members and the expulsion of unworthy ones.</p>

<p>The Lombard communities were in several respects more radical than the French. Holding that the validity of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> depends on the worthiness of the minister and viewing the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as the community of <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a>, they rejected its entire organization in so far as it was not based on the Scriptures. In regard to the reception of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, their practice was less radical than their theory. Although they looked upon the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> as unworthy <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>, they not infrequently received communion at their hands and justified this course on the grounds that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> nullifies the defect of the minister and directly grants his grace to the worthy recipient. The present Waldensian Church may be regarded as a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> type. It recognizes as its <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> standard the confession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> published in 1655 and based on the Reformed confession of 1559. It admits only two <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the Lord's Supper. Supreme authority in the body is exercised by an annual synod, and the affairs of the individual congregations are administered by a consistory under the presidency of the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>The Waldenses in France and Spain</h3>

<p>The preaching of Waldes and his disciples obtained immediate success not only in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, but also in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The Italian adherents at a very early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> constituted themselves independently. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the movement gained ground particularly in the South, whence it spread to Northern <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> sought to avert by persuasion the danger of numerous defections. As early as 1191 a religious conference was held between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and Waldenses at a place which has not been recorded; it was followed by a second held at <a href="11435b.htm">Pamiers</a> in 1207. The latter meeting brought about a return to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Duran of <a href="07513a.htm">Huesca</a> and several other Waldenses. With the authorization of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> they organized themselves into the special <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order of the <a href="12249a.htm">Poor Catholics</a> for the conversion of Waldenses. This purpose was attained only in a very small degree; but force soon checked the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> movement. In 1192 Bishop Otto of Toul ordered all Waldenses to be put in chains and delivered up to the episcopal tribunal. Two years later King Alphonso II of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> banished them from his dominions and forbade anyone to furnish them with shelter or food. These provisions were renewed by Pedro II at the Council of <a href="06530a.htm">Gerona</a> (1197), and death by burning was decreed against the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>The French authorities seem to have proceeded with less severity for a time. The <a href="01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, however, also reacted on the policy towards the Waldenses, and in 1214 seven of these suffered the <a href="12565a.htm">death penalty</a> at Maurillac. But it was only toward the middle of the thirteenth century that the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> lost ground in Provence and Languedoc. It did not disappear in these provinces until it was merged in the <a href="12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> movement, while <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Lorraine were freed from it in the course of the thirteenth century. The most conspicuous centre of Waldensian activity in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> during the later <a href="10285c.htm">middle ages</a> was Dauphin&eacute; and the western slope of the Cottian Alps. The <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> seems to have been introduced in to this territory from <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. From Dauphin&eacute; and the valleys of the Alps it carried on missionary work in all Southern <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to the Atlantic seaboard. In 1403 a determined effort was made to win back the Waldenses of the valleys of Louise, Argenti&egrave;re, and Freissini&egrave;eres; but the apostolic labours of even a St. Vincent Ferrer were powerless. The <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was equally unsuccessful, as were also the stern measures of the local <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. The policy of repression was temporarily abandoned under King Louis XI, who, <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> them to be <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, extended to the Waldenses of the above-mentioned valleys his royal protection in an ordinance of 1478.</p>

<p>This period of peace was followed in 1488 by a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> summoned by <a href="08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> against the Waldenses. The <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> did not succeed in stamping them out. But, soon after, the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> profoundly modified the <a href="13674a.htm">sect's</a> history and <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> development. A deputation composed of G. Morel and P. Masson was sent in 1530 to <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> for information concerning the new religious <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. On their return journey Masson was arrested at <a href="04794b.htm">Dijon</a> and executed; Morel alone safely accomplished his mission. The report of this journey led to the assembling of a general convention to which Farel and other <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> were invited. The meeting was held at Chanforans in the valley of Angrogne and the Reformed teaching substantially adopted (1532). A minority opposed this course and vainly sought to stem the tide of radicalism by an appeal for assistance to the <a href="02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a>. A new convention held in the valley of St. Martin in 1533 confirmed the decisions of Chanforans. The open adoption of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> soon led to the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> in which Waldensianism disappeared from Provence (1545). The history of the communities in other districts became henceforth identified with that of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<h3>The Waldenses in Italy and other countries</h3>

<p>Italy became a more permanent home of Waldensianism and more active in missionary work than <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. During the very first years of Waldes's preaching, converts to his views are mentioned in <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. They increased rapidly in number and were joined by some members of the Order of <a href="07543a.htm">Humiliati</a>. But dissensions soon arose between the Waldensians in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and in <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. The latter organized guilds of craftsmen, desired leaders of their own, and refused admission among the perfect to married <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> without the consent of their consort. On Waldes's refusal to sanction these points, his followers in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> seceded during the first decade of the thirteenth century. After his death a vain attempt at reunion was made at <a href="02489c.htm">Bergamo</a> in 1218. The Italian branch after some time not only prospered in the valleys of western <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, but also established important colonies in Calabria and Apulia. In the fifteenth century communities hardly less important are mentioned in the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> and other parts of Central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Waldenses in the <a href="14313c.htm">Diocese of Strasburg</a> is recorded in 1211 and the years 1231-1233 were marked in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by resolute efforts to stamp out their <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>. But soon, adherents of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> were found in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and other sections. They spread in the north to the shores of the Baltic Sea, and in the east to <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. With the appearance of new <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> they at times partly lost their distinctive character. In <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> they amalgamated with the <a href="07585a.htm">Hussites</a> and the <a href="02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a> without losing all their peculiarities.</p>

<p><a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was still more readily accepted. Not only were its teachings universally adopted, but numerous Waldensian communities were merged in the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches, the Italian congregations alone retaining an independent existence and the original name. Those in the <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> valleys enjoyed religious peace from 1536-1559, owing to the political dependence of the districts upon <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. A contrary policy was pursued by the Dukes of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>; but the Waldenses at the very outset successfully resisted, and in 1561 were granted in certain districts the free exercise of their religion. In 1655 <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> was again fruitlessly resorted to. Later in the same century (1686, 1699) some of them, under stress of renewed <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, civil equality was granted them in 1799 when the French occupied the country. They enjoyed this peace until the downfall of <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, but again lost it at the return of the house of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. From 1816 onward, however, gradual concessions were made to the Waldenses, and in 1848 Charles Albert granted them complete and permanent liberty. Renewed activity has since marked their history. They founded in 1855 a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Torre Pellice and transferred it to Florence in 1860. Through emigration they have spread to several cities of Southern <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and also to North and South America. There are five congregations in <a href="15230c.htm">Uruguay</a> and two in <a href="01702d.htm">Argentina</a>. Three colonies have settled in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>: at Wolfe Ridge, <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>; Valdese, North Carolina; and Monett, Missouri. The communities which in the seventeenth century settled in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> have since severed their connection with the church and abandoned their original language. In Hesse-Darmstadt they were prohibited the use of French in 1820-21; in W&uuml;rtemberg they joined the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> State Church in 1823. Later on, they began receiving financial support from the "American Waldensian Aid Society" founded in 1906, and from a similar organization in Great Britain.</p>
