<p>(Ossoriensis.)</p>

<p>In the Province of Leinster, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, is bounded on the south by the Suir, on the east by the Barrow, on the west by Tipperary and King's County, and on the north by Queen's County. It has an area of 600,000 acres, and corresponds geographically with the ancient Kingdom of Ossory, whose first king, Aengus Osrithe, flourished in the second century of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> era. His successors extended their boundaries to include part of Tipperary. In the fifth century the neighbouring tribe of the Deisi, aided by the Corca- Laighde, conquered South Ossory, and for over a century, the Corca- Laighde chiefs ruled in place of the dispossessed Ossory chiefs. Early in the seventh century the ancient chiefs recovered much of their lost possessions, the foreigners were overcome, and the descendants of Aengus ruled once more. One of the greatest was Carroll, prominent in the ninth century and distinguished in the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>.</p>

<p>Ossory had been <a href="04347a.htm">Christianized</a> long before this. St. Kieran, its apostle, now the patron of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was born about the fourth century at a place now known as St. Kieran's Strand, near Cape Clear, and was probably converted to the Faith by foreign traders. According to the tradition, he went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was there <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Having met <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, St. Kieran received from him a bell with the charge to return to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and found a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the spot where the bell should first sound. When the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> had passed beyond Ossory, and was descending the western slopes of Slieve Bloom, the bell at length sounded; and here St. Kieran established the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Seir-Kieran, the centre from which Ossory was evangelized. <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> also visited Ossory and preached and founded churches there. There is some difficulty in accepting the story of St. Kieran having preached before <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, since the former is said to have flourished in the sixth century. It is, however, certain that St. Kieran laboured in Ossory. In the centuries following the newly-converted kingdom was ruled from Seir-Kieran by the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>. They had other <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> subject to them, and probably other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and perhaps were not always <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves, though at Seir-Kieran, as at <a href="08090a.htm">Iona</a>, there was always a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Their <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was tribal rather than territorial, and hence the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was enlarged or contracted as the fortunes of the Ossory chiefs rose or fell. At the synod of Rathbreasail (1118) the limits of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> were permanently fixed substantially as they have since remained. At the same time the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred from Seir-Kieran to Aghaboe (see <a href="03250a.htm">SAINT CANICE</a>), but at the end of the twelfth century it was transferred to Kilkenny, where it has since remained. It is probable that <a href="03250a.htm">St. Canice</a> founded a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Kilkenny, and not unlikely that the beginnings of a town soon appeared there, to become more important when the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> changed from Aghaboe. Kilkenny also became the residence of Marshall, Earl of <a href="11611a.htm">Pembroke</a>, Strongbow's heir and descendent, by whom Kilkenny Castle was built. Before the fourteenth century Marshall's inheritance passed to the Butlers, and under them Kilkenny became great. It was made up of an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> and an English town, each with a charter, and each, until 1800, returning two members to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament. The united towns were incorporated by a charter from Elizabeth, and by a further charter from James I, as a free city, with a mayor. The city still returns a member to the Imperial Parliament. The Butlers, ennobled as Earls and Dukes of Ormonde, have always interested themselves in its welfare. These powerful nobles were sometimes charged with the government of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; not infrequently Kilkenny was the residence of the viceroy and saw a Parliament sitting within its walls, and there the Statute of Kilkenny was passed (1367). The Ormondes were always favourable to Anglo-Norman development at Kilkenny, and after the beginning of the thirteenth century no Irishman was appointed to the See of Ossory. In the reign of Bishop Hugh De Rous (1202-15) the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="03250a.htm">St. Canice</a> was built. Two subsequent <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, De Mapilton (1251-60) and Thomas Barry (1427- 60), filled the office of treasurer of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, while another, Richard De Northalis (1387-95), acted as the King's ambassador abroad. At the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, though the Earls of Ormonde were among the first to conform, Ossory clung to the Faith; and when John Bale was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Edward VI, and endeavoured to <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantize</a> the people, he was roughly handled and driven from Kilkenny, leaving Ossory in peace. The peace ended with the death of Mary, and in Elizabeth's reign the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was vacant for seventeen years. From 1602 to 1618 Ossory was again without a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and when <a href="13207a.htm">Dr. Rothe</a> was appointed (1620) there was not a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In the rebellion of 1641 Kilkenny was the centre of national resistance and the headquarters of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Confederation. The part played by <a href="13207a.htm">Dr. Rothe</a> was prominent and patriotic; but his best efforts were unavailing, for Ormonde was able to foment divisions, the Anglo-Irish and the old <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> would not blend for the common good, and the want of vigour in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> counsels prepared the way for Ormonde's treachery and Cromwell's victories. While the Cromwellians held Kilkenny, <a href="13207a.htm">Rothe</a> died there (1650), and for twenty years following Ossory was governed by vicars. During the few periods of toleration in the reign of Charles II a feeble revival of religion took place. In 1678 the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> reported to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that in many cases one <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> was in charge of five or six <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; that the few remaining <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> ministered by stealth and in ruined churches; and that the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, and <a href="03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> had completely disappeared.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the penal times Ossory suffered much, but its <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> survived, and when toleration came it was ruled by an exceptional man, De Burgo (1759-86). Equally capable was his successor, Troy (1777-86), subsequently <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. To understand his praise of George III, his friendship with the viceroy and with Luttrell, son of the <a href="08001a.htm">infamous</a> Lord Carhampton, we must make allowance for the times in which he lived. He acted from no personal motive, but for the good of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, for he was <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> in propagating the Faith and enforcing discipline. He was among the first of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to take advantage of the relaxation of the <a href="11611c.htm">penal laws</a> and set up a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> for his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the purchase of Burrell's Hall, Kilkenny. Two of its first staff became his successors, Dr. Dunne (1787-89) and Dr. Lanigan (1789-1812). Under the latter the college at Burrell's Hall was transferred to more suitable premises and its curriculum extended. It was not until the episcopate of Dr. Kinsella that a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college worthy of Ossory was founded. In 1836 the foundation stone of St. Kieran's College, Kilkenny, was laid and two years later the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was opened for students. Dr. Kinsella also aided his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to build several <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> churches. He laid the foundation stone of the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Mary in 1843, though the exterior was not finished until 1857, nor solemnly <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> until 1899. Dr. Walsh (1846-72) succeeded Dr. Kinsella, and was succeeded by Dr. Moran, now (1911) <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="14365a.htm">Sydney</a>. Dr. Moran was succeeded, in 1884, by Dr. Brownrigg, a native of Carlow. <a href="05295b.htm">Educated</a> at <a href="10087b.htm">Maynooth</a>, Dr. Brownrigg displayed unusual ability, was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1861, and was subsequently professor at St. Peter's College, Wexford, and superior of the House of Missions at Enniscorthy.</p>

<p>No diocese in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> is more interesting than Ossory for historical and antiquarian remains. There are the relics of old churches associated with the lives and acts of the early <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, such as those of Seir-Kieran and Aghaboe. There are round towers, Norman castles, and holy wells, raths and mounds, ancient forts, cromlechs, and pillar stones. In the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Danesfort is Burnchurch castle, in Durrow the castle of Cullahill. There are the ruins of Kells Priory and of Inistioge, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of Rosebercon, and the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> abbey of Jerpoint. Kilkenny Castle is an interesting relic of history, and near by are the remains of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, the Black Abbey, and St. John's <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a>. The number of distinguished men connected with the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is large. <a href="04074a.htm">Clyn</a> and Grace, the <a href="01531b.htm">annalists</a>, were both of Kilkenny. <a href="13207a.htm">Rothe</a> was not only a public man, but an author of eminence. De Burgo's work on the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> is still an essential book for <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> historians. Other famous men are: James Butler, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, author of "Butler's Catechism"; Dr. Minogue, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sacramento; Dr. Ireland, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>; Dr. O'Reilly, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="01140a.htm">Adelaide</a>; Dr. John O'Donovan; Dr. Kelly, for many years professor of <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> at <a href="10087b.htm">Maynooth</a>; Dr. O'Hanlon, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> professor in the same college; Dr. MacDonald, his successor; and Dr. Carrigan, whose "History of Ossory" is the most complete history of any <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> diocese. In 1910 the diocese contained: 41 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 36 <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>; 5 administrators; 58 <a href="04570a.htm">curates</a>; 11 regulars (a total of 119 priests); 96 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>; 1 college; 4 houses of regulars; 15 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>; 4 houses of <a href="08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>. In 1901 the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population was 83,519; the non- <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, 6029.</p>
