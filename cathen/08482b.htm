<p>Called in his day, JEHAN PETIT or LE PETIT.</p>

<p>A French <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> and professor in the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>; b. most likely at Brachy, Caux, in <a href="11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, and certainly in the <a href="13208b.htm">Diocese of Rouen</a>, about 1360; d. 15 July, 1411. Some historians (Duboulay, <a href="15521d.htm">Wadding</a>) say he was a <a href="06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a>, others that he was a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>: as a matter of fact, he never was a member of any <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order. He owed his <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> to the generosity of the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, who granted him a pension. In the first extant document that records his name, he is called <a href="01759a.htm">master of arts</a> (16 August, 1385). Two years later his name occurs in the list sent by the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> (31 July, 1387) to <a href="13096c.htm">Pope Clement VII</a>, recommending its masters for vacant <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at that time was torn by the <a href="13539a.htm">great Western Schism</a>. <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> sided with <a href="13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>, but every one was anxious for reunion. John Parvus gave expression to this desire in his "Complainte de l'&Eacute;glise," a poem, which has been recently discovered in the National Library at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. This poem of 322 verses was composed in 1394. He had already written four others, the "Disputation des pastourelles" (1388), wherein he defends the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin; the "Livre du champ d'or"; the "Livre du miracle de Basqueville" (1389); and the "Vie de Monsieur saint L&eacute;onard," about the same time. The last three works have recently been published. They do not display much literary talent, but their sentiment is dignified and delicate; they offer an unflattering picture of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of the day, and they form a useful contribution to the study of contemporary manners. He became a licentiate in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> in May, 1400, and received the degree of Doctor before 1403, since he is mentioned in that year on the roll of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> as an active member of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In April, 1407, he formed part of the imposing embassy sent by Charles VI to urge <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> and <a href="07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> to abdicate and thus <a href="15132a.htm">reunite Christendom</a>. This embassy had just returned to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, after a fruitless journey, when an event took place that gave John Parvus a great <a href="11126b.htm">notoriety</a> in history.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On 23 November, 1407, the Duke of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, brother of King Charles VI, was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> by assassins in the pay of John the Fearless, Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. The Duke of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> was unpopular with the people and was held responsible for the disorders and the taxations under which the kingdom groaned, during the madness of the king, his brother. The <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> was bitterly opposed to him for having renewed obedience to <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. The Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, on the contrary, was very popular; he was regarded as a friend of the commoners and an opponent of taxation and abuses, while the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was grateful to him for his lack of sympathy with the <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Being excluded from the royal council after the assassination, he withdrew to his estates in <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, raised an army, and called around him several of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> professors, including John Parvus, who for three years had been attached to his suite and was receiving a pension from him. Reassured, doubtless, by the talents of his defender, he declared that he would go to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and justify himself. In vain the royal council forbade him to enter the capital; he came, and was received with acclamations by the populace. He demanded an audience with the king. It was granted him on 8 March, 1408, in the H&ocirc;tel de St-Paul, where the court habitually resided.</p>

<p>There, in presence of the Dauphin, of the Duke of Anjou, King of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, of Cardinal de Bar, of the Dukes of Berry, Brittany, Bar, and Lorraine, of the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and of many counts, barons, <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>, and citizens, John Parvus delivered on behalf of his client a pedantic address, bristling with propositions, syllogisms, Scriptural texts, and examples from <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a>. His argument may be expressed in the following syllogism: Whosoever is guilty of high treason and becomes a tyrant, deserves to be <a href="12565a.htm">punished with death</a>, all the more so when he is a near relative of the king; and in that case the natural, moral, and Divine <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> allow any subject whatever, without any command or public authorization, to kill him or to have him killed openly, or by stealth; and the more closely the author of the slaying is related to the king the more meritorious the act. Now, the Duke of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> &mdash; so ran the minor proposition &mdash; a slave to the passion of <a href="02148b.htm">greed</a>, the source of all <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, was guilty of high treason, and was a tyrant; which was <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by holding him guilty of all the pretended crimes which popular <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the partisans of the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> laid to his charge. The conclusion was therefore that the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> not only should not be punished or blamed for what had been done to the Duke of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, but rather should be rewarded. This thesis seemed preposterous to the more rational members of the assembly; but the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> was present with his troops, ready to suppress any attempt at reply, and further he was in the good <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>; so he had no difficulty in obtaining letters of pardon from the king. As for John Parvus, who in his address was not ashamed to admit that he was receiving, and expected still to receive, a pension from the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, he found it more prudent to withdraw from <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and retire to the estate of the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> at Hesdin, Artois, where he died in a house of his protector, regretting, it is said, that he had ever allowed himself to defend such a proposition.</p>

<p>The interest it excited was not to die with him. As long as the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> was all-powerful in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the argument could not be attacked publicly, but when he was expelled, <a href="06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, in a sermon delivered before the king, strongly denounced seven propositions of John Parvus as <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> and <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> (1413). Shortly afterwards the king asked the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Gerard de Montaigu, and the inquisitor of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to examine them and to take whatever action they judged proper &mdash; without however mentioning the name of John Parvus. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the inquisitor with sixty <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> went into what was called a "Council of the Faith." After several sittings the speech of John Parvus and nine propositions, said to have been extracted from it, were condemned (23 February, 1414) by <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and of the inquisitor, and the book containing them was publicly burnt three days later. In the month of March following, the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> appealed from the decision of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> to <a href="08434a.htm">Pope John XXIII</a>. The pontiff entrusted the investigation to three <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. On the other hand, <a href="06530c.htm">Gerson</a> and the ambassadors of the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> brought the affair before the council. At this juncture, <a href="08434a.htm">Pope John XXIII</a> left <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> (20 March, 1415) and withdrew from the <a href="04288a.htm">council</a>, while the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> made peace by the Treaty of Arras (22 February, 1415). Thereupon Charles VI ordered his representatives to take no action at the council against John Parvus, provided the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> would also let the matter rest. <a href="06530c.htm">Gerson</a> broke the agreement by trying to obtain from the council a declaration that the writings of John Parvus contained numerous <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> in matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. The Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> replied by a letter in which, while disavowing the general principles that formed the major proposition of the argument of John Parvus, he maintained that the propositions condemned by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> were not contained in the discourse. Thereupon the three <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, entrusted with the duke's appeal, cited the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> to appear before them, and as he failed to do so, they reversed his decision, declaring at the same time that they did not intend thereby to approve of the propositions condemned by him, but only wished to do <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> to the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, who had not been heard at the trial. From that moment the trial of John Parvus became the battleground of the ambassadors of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and of the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and even of the Emperor Sigismund. The council had no intention of lending its authority to any political party, and in its fifteenth session, 6 July, 1415, contented itself with a general condemnation of <a href="15108a.htm">tyrannicide</a> as upheld in the following proposition: "A tyrant may be licitly and meritoriously, and rightly <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> by any vassal or subject, even by resorting to secret plots, adulation, and feigned friendship, notwithstanding any <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty to him or treaty concluded with him, without any judicial <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> or order." But John Parvus was not mentioned and the council avoided saying that any such proposition was contained in his address, and no further decision was pronounced by the council on the particular case of John Parvus. After securing the condemnation of John Parvus in August, 1416, King Charles VI two years later disavowed <a href="06530c.htm">Gerson</a> and his supporters (6 October, 1418), and on 3 November, 1418, he rehabilitated John Parvus and annulled the sentences pronounced against him. This perhaps was the fairest settlement of the case against him. His venal and odious defence of the assassination is worthy of all censure, but in <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> it must be admitted that the propositions attributed to him by his adversaries are not contained in his discourse, at least in the form in which it has reached us.</p>
