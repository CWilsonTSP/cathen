<h2 id="section1">Terminology</h2>

<p>The word <em>seminary</em> (Fr. <em>s&eacute;minaire,</em> Ger. <em>Seminar</em>) is sometimes used, especially in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, to designate a group of <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> students devoted to a special line of work. The same word is often applied in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> to young ladies' academies, <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> or <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. When qualified by the word <em>ecclesiastical</em>, it is reserved to <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> instituted, in accordance with a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, for the training of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It differs therefore from the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and the scholasticate where members of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders receive their spiritual and <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> formation. In the ecclesiastical seminary both go together. Hence, a faculty of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> is not a seminary; neither is the word to be applied to the German <em>Konvictus,</em> where <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students live together while attending lectures of the faculty of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the State <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>An ecclesiastical seminary is <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, interdiocesan, provincial, or pontifical, according as it is under the control of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, of several <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who send there their students, of all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of an <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, or of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. A seminary which receives students from several provinces or from <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in various parts of the country is called a central, or a national, seminary.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary (<em>grand s&eacute;minaire</em>) provides courses in <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> etc., and gives young men immediate preparation for <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>. A preparatory seminary (<em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em>) gives only a collegiate course as a preparation for entrance into the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary. The word seminary when used alone designates either a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary or a seminary including both the collegiate and the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> courses.</p>

<p>In this connexion it should be noted that the name "college" is sometimes given to institutions which offer no collegiate courses in the usual sense of the term, but receive only <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who intend to study <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Such are All Hallows College, Drumcondra, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges on the Continent, and the various national colleges in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (see respective articles). These are in reality seminaries as regards both instruction and discipline. On the other hand there are seminaries which provide undergraduate courses as preparatory to philosophy and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, thus combining in one institution the work of the <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em> and that of the <em>grand s&eacute;minaire.</em></p>

<h2 id="section2">Purpose of seminary education</h2>

<p>A seminary is a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in which <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are trained. A <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is the representative of Christ among men: his mission is to carry on <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> work for the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name and by His power, he teaches men what they ought to believe and what they ought to do: he forgives <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, and offers in sacrifice the Body and Blood of Christ. He is another Christ (<em>sacerdos alter Christus</em>). His training, therefore, must be in harmony with this high office and consequently different in many ways from the preparation for secular professions. He must possess not only a liberal <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, but also professional <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and moreover, like an army or navy officer, he needs to acquire the manners and personal habits becoming his calling. To teach candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> what a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> and to make them what a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to be is the purpose of seminary <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>; to this twofold end everything in the form of studies and discipline must be directed.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Life in the seminary</h2>

<p>When a boy of intelligence and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> shows an inclination to become a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, he is sent after graduation from the grammar or high school to pursue a classical course, either in a preparatory seminary or in a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mixed college where lay as well as <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students receive a classical <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. This course, successfully completed, prepares him for admission into the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary. The year opens with a retreat of eight or ten days, during which by meditations, conferences, visits to the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, recitation of the office, consultations with his <a href="05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, his mind and heart are brought under the influence of the great <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> of religion, so as to make him realize and feel the importance of his seminary training. Then begins the ordinary routine of the seminary, interrupted only by a short recess, usually at the end of the first term, and by the retreats which precede the <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and Trinity ordinations. The receptions of <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> are the greatest and the most joyful events of the year, for they keep before the mind of the student the goal of all his efforts, the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. During the scholastic year, a day of each week is set apart for a holiday: the morning is devoted to recreation, or to some favourite study; in the afternoon there is usually a walk, and at times the students visit <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or other institutions, where they acquire a foretaste and gain some experience of their future work among the sick and the poor. On Sunday they all assist at a solemn High Mass and at <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, and in some places they also attend a conference on <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The summer vacation, lasting about three months, is spent either at the seminary villa, as is the general practice in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, or at home, as is commonly done in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and other countries.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The ordinary working day is divided between <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, study, and recreation. Summer and winter, the student rises at 5 or 5.30 a. m., makes his meditation for a half-hour, hears Mass, and usually receives Communion. Breakfast is about two hours after rising. In the forenoon there are two classes of one hour each, while two hours also are devoted to private study. After dinner there is about an hour of recreation. In the afternoon four hours are divided between class and study, and as a rule another hour of study follows supper. A visit to the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, the recitation of the <a href="13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, and spiritual reading take place in the afternoon or evening; and the day closes with night <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Thus the student has devoted about three hours to exercises of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and nine hours to work. After six years of this <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> and moral training in retirement from the world, and in the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of fellow students animated by the same purpose and striving after the same ideals, he is deemed worthy of receiving the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> and capable of bearing the burden of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>: he is an <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> gentleman, he possesses professional <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he is ready to live and to work among men as the ambassador of Christ.</p>

<h2 id="section4">History</h2>

<h3 id="A">Late origin</h3>

<p>This system of seminary <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, which has now become an essential feature of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> life, had its origin only in the sixteenth century in a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Since <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> work on earth is to be continued chiefly through <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Apostles and the early <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> always gave special care to the selection and training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> warns Timothy not to impose hands lightly on any man (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs22">1 Timothy 5:22</a>). In the scanty records of the early <a href="12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> we invariably read the number of <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom they <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a>. But although the training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was ever held to be a matter of vital importance, we should look in vain during the first centuries for an organized system of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, just as we should look in vain for the fully-developed <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>.</p>

<h3 id="B">Individual training in early times</h3>

<p>Before <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> no trace can be found of any special institutions for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Professors and students in the famous <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of Alexandria and <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> supplied <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; but these <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were intended for the teaching of <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, and for general instruction; they cannot, therefore, be considered as seminaries. The training of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> was personal and practical; boys and young men attached to the service of a church assisted the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the discharge of their functions, and thus, by the exercise of the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, they gradually learned to look after the church, to read and explain <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, to prepare <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and to administer the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Some of the greatest <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the period had moreover received a liberal <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and before <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> spent some time in retirement, penitential exercises, and meditation on <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>.</p>

<h3 id="C">From St. Augustine to the foundation of the universities</h3>

<p><a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> established near the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, in his own house (<em>in domo ecclesi&oelig;</em>), a <em>monasterium clericorum</em> in which his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> lived together. He would raise to <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> only such as were willing to unite the community life with the exercise of the ministry. In a few years this institution gave ten <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to various sees in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>. It was, however, rather a <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> house than a seminary.</p>

<p>The example of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was soon followed at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="11089b.htm">Nola</a>, and elsewhere. A council held in 529 at <a href="16078b.htm">Vaison</a>, in Southern Gaul, exhorted <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to adopt a custom already obtaining in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, to have, young <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> in their house, and to instruct them with fatherly <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> so as to prepare for themselves worthy successors. Two years later the second Council of Toledo decreed that <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> should be trained by a superior in the house of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (<em>in domo Ecclesi&oelig;</em>), under the eye of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Another Council of Toledo, held in 633, urges that this training be begun early, so that future <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> may spend their youth not in unlawful pleasures but under <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. Among those <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, the best known is that established near the <a href="09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>, where many <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> <em>ab infantia.</em> Besides, not a few <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, such as St. Victor in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Le Bec in <a href="11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, and <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> not only their own subjects, but also aspirants to the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>.</p>

<h3 id="D">From the thirteenth century to the Council of Trent</h3>

<p>Out of the local episcopal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> grew the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, when illustrious teachers attracted to a few cities, e.g. <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Bologna, Oxford etc., students from various provinces and even from all parts of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. As in these <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and canon law held the first rank, a large proportion of the students were <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> or members of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; deprived of their ablest teachers and most gifted students, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> gradually declined. Still, only about one per cent of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were able to attend <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> courses. The <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the vast majority, therefore, was more and more neglected, while the privileged few enjoyed indeed the highest <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> advantages, but received little or no spiritual training. The colleges in which they lived maintained for a while good discipline; but in less than a century the life of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students at the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> was no better than that of the lay students. What was lacking was character-formation and the practical preparation for the ministry.</p>

<h3 id="E">The decree of the Council of Trent</h3>

<p>After the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the need of a well-trained <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was more keenly felt. In the work of the commission appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to prepare questions to be discussed in the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> occupies an important place. When the council convened "to extirpate heresy and reform morals", it decreed in its Fifth Session (June, 1546) that provision should be made in every <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for the teaching of grammar and <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> to <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> and poor scholars. The council was interrupted before the question of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> training could be formally taken up. Meanwhile, St. Ignatius established at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1553) the Collegium Germanicum for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of German <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students. <a href="12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, who had witnessed the foundation of the German College and had been a member of the commission to prepare for the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, went to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> after the death of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> to re-establish the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. In the regulations which he issued in 1556, the word <em>seminary</em> seems to have been used for the first time in its modern sense, to designate a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> exclusively devoted to the training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. After the council reopened, the Fathers resumed the question of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> training; and after discussing it for about a month, they adopted the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> on the foundation of ecclesiastical seminaries.</p>

<p>On 15 July, in the Twenty-third Session, it was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> proclaimed in its present form, and has ever since remained the fundamental law of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. In substance it is as follows:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>(1) Every <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is bound to support, to rear in <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, and to train in <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> a certain number of youths, in a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> to be chosen by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for that purpose; poor <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> may combine, large <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> may have more than one seminary.</li><li>(2) In these institutions are to be received boys who are at least twelve years of age, can read and write passably, and by their good disposition give hope that they will persevere in the service of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; children of the poor are to be preferred.</li><li>(3) Besides the elements of a liberal <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> [as then understood], the students are to be given professional <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to enable them to preach, to conduct Divine worship, and to administer the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.</li><li>(4) Seminaries are to be supported by a tax on the income of <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, chapters, <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and other <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>.</li><li>(5) In the government of the seminary, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to be assisted by two commissions of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, one for spiritual, the other for temporal matters.</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>So well did the Fathers of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> understand the importance of the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, so much did they expect from it, that they congratulated one another, and several declared that, had the council done nothing else, this would be more than sufficient reward of all their labours. An historian of the council, <a href="11426a.htm">Cardinal Pallavicini</a>, does not hesitate to call the institution of seminaries the most important reform enacted by the council.</p>

<h3 id="F">Execution of the Decree of Trent in various countries</h3>

<p>To provide for the carrying out of this important <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> forthwith instituted a commission of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The following year (April, 1564), he decreed the foundation of the Roman Seminary, which was opened in Feb., 1565, and which for more than three centuries has been a nursery of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who had taken a leading part in the work of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, was also most <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> and successful in enforcing its decisions. For his large diocese he established three seminaries: one of them furnished a complete course of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies; in another, a shorter course was provided, especially for those destined to country <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; the third was for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who needed to make up the deficiencies of previous training. For these institutions <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles</a> drew up a set of regulations, which have been ever since an inspiration and a model for all founders of seminaries. In other parts of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> was gradually put into effect, so that the smallest of the three hundred <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> had its own complete seminary, including both collegiate and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> departments.</p>

<p>In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and the progress of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> were serious obstacles to the carrying out of the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a>; still seminaries were founded at Eichstadt (1564), M&uuml;nster (1610), and Prague (1631).</p>

<p>In <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the <a href="02314b.htm">Venerable Bartholomew of the Martyrs</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02728a.htm">Braga</a>, established a seminary a few months after the close of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.</p>

<p>Various attempts by <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> ended in failure, until <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> and Father <a href="11240d.htm">Olier</a> opened seminaries in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1642), and helped to establish them elsewhere in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. A feature of these seminaries and, it is claimed, one of the causes of their success was the separation of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students from those who were studying the classics, of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> from the preparatory seminary. In <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> the students of St-Sulpice usually followed lectures at the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>; some courses given at the seminary completed their <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> training, while meditation, spiritual conferences, etc. provided for their moral and religious formation. In other places, especially when there was no <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, a complete course of instruction was organized in the seminary itself. As there was no Church law requiring students to spend a fixed time in the seminary before <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and as the powers of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were hampered by existing customs, some of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, previous to the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, were not trained in these institutions.</p>

<p>In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> prevented the foundation of seminaries; before the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for the English mission were trained at the English College of <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a>. <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> aspirants to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, leaving <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at the peril of their lives, went to the colleges founded for them in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and Salamanca by <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> exiles and other generous benefactors, to prepare for a life of self-sacrifice often ending in <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<h3 id="G">Attempts at secularization</h3>

<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century, the <a href="08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> attempted to bring the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> under the control of the State. Students were forbidden by law to frequent the German College in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; episcopal seminaries were suppressed, and in their place central seminaries were founded at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Budapest, <a href="11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, and <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, in which all <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> students were forced to receive their <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> under the control not of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> but of the state. Professors and text books were chosen by state officials, who also regulated the discipline. Against this usurpation, protests came not only from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but also from the people; at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> the central seminary was burned to the ground. The scheme had to be abandoned, and the successor of <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> allowed the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to possess and rule their own seminaries.</p>

<p>The tendency to interference, however, remained, and has since shown itself in various German states. In the early years of the nineteenth century the policy of secularization was adopted by the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Government. <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> or <a href="06258b.htm">Free-thinkers</a> were appointed teachers in the faculty of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and the seminaries; regulations were drawn up for the choice of superiors, discipline, plan of studies, examinations, admission, and dismissal of students. After a long conflict a concordat was signed in 1817, by which the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to erect and control seminaries were recognized. The same struggle occurred in other German states. The conflict became specially acute in 1873, when the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government in the famous May Laws issued a scheme which prescribed a regular course in a gymnasium, three years <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> at a state <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, and then examination before state inspectors, as essential conditions of appointment to any <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> position. Education in seminaries might be accepted as equivalent if the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> submitted the rules to the State for approval. As they refused to comply, the seminaries of Treves, <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen-Posen</a>, <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and others were closed. Negotiations between the Government and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were opened after the election of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. Among the points on which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> could never yield, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> laid stress upon the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to have seminaries and to control the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The more vexatious measures were abolished, and harmony was restored between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>.</p>

<h3 id="H">Present conditions in Germany</h3>

<p>At present nearly all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students make their college course in a public gymnasium, together with lay students. For the teaching of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and spiritual formation there are two systems. The first consists of a course of three years in one of the faculties of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, in the State <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> of Bonn, <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, T&uuml;bingen, or <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. The appointment of professors in these faculties is made by the Government but with the approval of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who can moreover forbid their students to attend the lectures of objectionable teachers. While at the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> the students usually live together in a <em>Konvictus</em> under one or two <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, but they enjoy about as much liberty as lay students. After completing their course they spend a year or eighteen months in a practical seminary (<em>priesterseminar</em>), to learn ceremonies, ascetic and pastoral theology, and thus prepare immediately for <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>. For this system, which has many strong advocates, the following advantages are pointed out: it develops <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral initiative, accustoms the students to live in the world, and gives them the prestige of a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. Its opponents insist: That it is not in harmony with the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of Trent and the subsequent instructions of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, urging <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to establish seminaries <em>ad mentem concilii Tridentini,</em> where candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> may receive the special <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> proper to their calling; that, the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> professors being irremovable, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> have not sufficient control over the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of their teaching; that instruction obtained in those faculties lacks unity and co-ordination, some essential points being overlooked, while undue importance is at times attached to matters of little practical utility for the majority of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>; that the spiritual training, neglected in the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, cannot be obtained in the few months spent at the practical seminary.</p>

<p>There are regular <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> seminaries at <a href="05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;dt</a>, <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, and <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, in which professional instruction and spiritual formation go together. Recently a compromise between the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> and the seminary systems of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> training has been effected in Strasburg.</p>

<h3 id="J">Recent developments and present conditions in other countries</h3>

<h3 id="A">France</h3>

<p>The <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> swept away the seminaries and the faculty of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of the Sorbonne where the leaders of the French <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> had been trained. As soon as liberty was restored, one of the first cares of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> was to re-establish their seminaries. On account of the lack of thoroughly competent teachers in many places and the urgent need of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> everywhere, only a minimum of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> could be exacted. Nor had the short-lived faculty of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> established by the State at the <a href="14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> much influence in raising the general standard of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> studies. During the last thirty years, however, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutes of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a>, and Angers have done much to train teachers for <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminaries, as well as for the <em>petits s&eacute;minaires.</em> The latter are usually open to all who seek a liberal <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, whether they intend to become <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> or not; hence, they do not realize the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> ideal. As a result of the Separation Law, the seminaries, even those built by private contributions of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, have been confiscated by the State. In spite of financial difficulties and the falling-off in the number of students, <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> seminaries are maintained, some with less than a score of students. As to preparatory seminaries, whereas formerly there were several in most <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, their number is considerably reduced.</p>

<h3 id="B">England</h3>

<p>The English College at <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a>, suppressed by the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, was replaced in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="15233b.htm">St. Edmund's, Ushaw</a>, and Oscott. These provided a complete course of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, including collegiate and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies; none, however, was a seminary in the strict sense of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, for they received lay as well as <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students. In the provincial councils of Westminster, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> advocated the separation of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> from lay students as the only remedy against worldliness; they decreed that the foundation of seminaries for the exclusive <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> would contribute powerfully to the increase of religion, and finally they pledged themselves to establish such seminaries. <a href="09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> founded a separate seminary for the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students of the <a href="15592c.htm">Archdiocese of Westminster</a>, and regarded this as the great work of his life. Other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> followed this example. A seminary in full harmony with the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, i.e. exclusively for <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students, and destined to provide a complete course of preparation for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was opened for the <a href="14162b.htm">Diocese of Southwark</a>.</p>

<p><a href="15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a>, who succeeded <a href="09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> in 1893, had long been of opinion that separate <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> seminaries were not opportune in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. He advocated a central seminary for the southern <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, in which by combining their resources in men and money the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> could provide excellent teachers, a good <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>, the emulation which comes with increased number of students, and the stability which would be secured, if the control of one <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> were replaced by that of a board of all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> interested. These views being freely expressed in "The Tablet" (London), Dr. Bourne, the future successor of <a href="15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> at <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, then <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Southwark Seminary, set forth in the same periodical the reasons for separate <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> seminaries, i.e. the authority of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and of the provincial councils of Westminster, the possibility of giving in most <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the elementary yet solid instruction needed for the ministry, and of sending some of the most gifted students to some foreign <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> where they would receive higher instruction than could be provided in a central seminary in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. <a href="15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> having secured the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> and encouragement of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> for his project determined, together with four other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to send his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students to Oscott, which thus, from being the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> seminary of <a href="02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, became in 1897 a central seminary for six <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. No change, however, was made in the faculty, and the administration continued in the main to be <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. Shortly after the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> death, a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary for the <a href="15592c.htm">Archdiocese of Westminster</a> was opened in connexion with St. Edmund's College.</p>

<h3 id="C">Ireland</h3>

<p><a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> colleges on the Continent, which harboured about five hundred students, having been closed by the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, it became <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to provide in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> for the training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. A college opened at Carlow in 1793 was soon closed through fear of Government prosecution. Re-established later, it now gives a complete course of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> training. The foundation of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college being made legal by an Act of Parliament, Maynooth was opened in 1795 with forty students. It has rapidly developed, especially during the last years of the nineteenth century. The missionary college of All Hallows was founded in 1842, and placed in 1892 under the direction of the <a href="10357a.htm">Vincentians</a>; it has sent hundreds of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a>, <a href="11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, South Africa, and the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. Besides these and other institutions, most of the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> have their preparatory seminaries. There are also some <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students at Salamanca and at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="08158a.htm">Irish College</a> in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> has been closed in consequence of the Separation Laws in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<h3 id="D">Canada</h3>

<p>The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at Quebec in 1637. Bishop Laval founded a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary in 1663 and in 1668 a preparatory seminary, the students of which followed the classes of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">College</a>. When the latter was suppressed after the English conquest, the preparatory seminary became a mixed college. In 1852 the seminary and college of Quebec were raised to the rank of a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, with the title of Laval in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the founder. At <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was founded by the <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> in 1767, a separate <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> department was established in 1840, and the seminary of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in 1847. More recently <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminaries have been opened at Ottawa by the Oblates and at <a href="07117b.htm">Halifax</a> by the <a href="05596b.htm">Eudists</a>, and one is being erected at <a href="14781d.htm">Toronto</a>. Until recently, in several <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> received their training not in seminaries, but in mixed colleges where, after finishing their classical course, they read <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, whilst discharging the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of prefect or teacher. Upon the advice of the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, the <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1895) decreed that <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> studying for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in colleges can only be prefects and not teachers; it also decreed that before <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> they must spend three years in a regular seminary.</p>

<h3 id="E">United States</h3>

<p>In colonial days, <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> laboured in <a href="06115b.htm">Florida</a>, <a href="09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, <a href="11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, and <a href="03170a.htm">California</a>; missionaries from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> were the pioneers in <a href="09541b.htm">Maine</a>, New York, and the Mississippi Valley; the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> missions, under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, were in charge of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. When John Carroll was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, one of his first cares was to provide the means for the training of a native <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, where he went to receive episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, he obtained from a friend a generous gift for his future seminary, and he accepted an offer made to him in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, in the name of Father Emery, superior of St-Sulpice, to send some members of his <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> to establish a seminary at <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. In his first address to his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people on his return to America, Bishop Carroll mentioned among the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of his pastoral office the institution of a seminary "for training up <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> for the sanctuary and the services of religion that we may no longer depend on foreign and uncertain coadjutors".</p>

<p>The following year (1791) Father Nagot, with three other <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> and four students, reached Baltimore and opened St. Mary's Seminary in the place where it stands today. In this first American seminary Bishop Carroll <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 25 May, 1793, his first <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="02200b.htm">Rev. S. Badin</a>, who for over half a century laboured on the missions of <a href="08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>. The lack of a sufficient number of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students forced the <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> to receive lay students also, even <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, so that St. Mary's became a mixed college and, until the classical department was closed in 1852, had but few seminarians. In order to foster and preserve <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vocations, Father Nagot opened (1807) at Pigeon Hill, <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, a preparatory seminary which was the following year transferred to Mount St. Mary's, but this institution soon became (like St. Mary's at <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>), and has remained to this day (1911), a mixed college with a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary, the students of which help in carrying on the work of the collegiate department. A more successful attempt to have a purely preparatory seminary was made by the <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> in the foundation of St. Charles's College; opened in 1848, it has always been destined exclusively for aspirants to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</p>

<p>As new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were created, the first care of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> was to provide a <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Shortly after their <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> usually went to <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> to recruit <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, while at home they spared no pains to train a native <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Bishop Flaget went to Bardstown in 1811 with three students, the nucleus of St. Thomas's Seminary which for half a century was the nursery of many pioneer <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the West. It was closed in 1869. Seminaries were likewise established by: <a href="05470a.htm">Bishop England</a> at <a href="03630a.htm">Charleston</a> (1822); Bishop Dubourg at St. Louis (1818); Bishop Fenwick at <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> (1829); Bishop Fenwick at <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a> (1829); <a href="08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> at Philadelphia (1832); Bishop Dubois at New York (1832); Bishop Blanc at <a href="11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> (1838); Bishop O'Connor at <a href="12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a> (1844); Bishop Whelan at <a href="13050a.htm">Richmond</a> (1842) and Wheeling (1850); Bishop Henni at <a href="10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a> (1846); Bishop Lefebre at <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a> (1846); Bishop Timon at <a href="03037a.htm">Buffalo</a> (1847); Bishop Rappe at <a href="04055a.htm">Cleveland</a> (1849); Bishop Loras at <a href="05179b.htm">Dubuque</a> (1849). As a rule these seminaries were begun in or near the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house, and often with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> as the chief instructor. The more advanced students helped to instruct the others, and all took part in the services of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Their <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, like that given to <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in the Early Church, was individual and practical; their <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> training may have been somewhat deficient, but their <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> character was moulded by daily intercourse with the self-sacrificing pioneer <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>

<p>Most of those imperfectly organized seminaries, after doing good service in their day, have long ceased to exist, while a few have been transformed into modern institutions. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> seminary of New York was transferred (1836) from Nyack to Lafargeville, in the Thousand Islands, and later on to <a href="15203b.htm">Fordham</a> (1840). In 1864 a seminary was opened at Troy for the provinces of New York and <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>; the latter established its own seminary in 1884, and in 1897 the New York seminary was transferred to its present location at Dunwoodie. The <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary at Philadelphia, which commenced with five students in the upper rooms of <a href="08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick's</a> residence, was after various vicissitudes transferred in 1865 to its actual site at Overbrook, where the preparatory seminary opened at Glen Riddle in 1859 was also located in 1871. The Seminary of St. Francis, <a href="10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, started in 1846 with seven students in a wooden building attached to Bishop Henni's house, was through the efforts of <a href="13415a.htm">Dr. Salzmann</a> removed to the present building, which was dedicated in 1856. In San Francisco, after several unsuccessful attempts under <a href="01380e.htm">Bishop Amat</a> and <a href="01282a.htm">Archbishop Alemany</a>, a preparatory seminary was opened by Archbishop Riordan in 1896; to this was soon added a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> department. The St. Paul Seminary, opened by Archbishop Ireland in 1894-95, has done excellent service in <a href="05295b.htm">educating</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for many of the western <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.</p>

<p>Among the leaders in the development of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in America the late Bishop MacQuaid deserves a prominent place. He was the first president of Seton Hall College (1856), and later on as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester he established the preparatory Seminary of St. Andrew, 1871, and the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> Seminary of St. Bernard. The latter, which opened in 1893 with thirty-nine students, numbers now over two hundred from various <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The Josephinum, founded at <a href="04149a.htm">Columbus</a> (1875) and placed under the immediate direction of <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (1892), provides a free and complete course for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> destined for the American missions, especially in German-speaking congregations. The Polish college and seminary at <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a> has been established to meet the special needs of Polish <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>.</p>

<p>Religious orders had their full share in this growth of seminaries. The <a href="10357a.htm">Vincentians</a>, who have always considered the training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> as an essential part of their work, opened the seminary at St. Louis (1816) which has been under their care ever since. They also conducted the seminary of <a href="11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> from 1838 until its suppression. They founded Niagara (1867), which has been raised to the rank of a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> and maintains an important <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> department. For ten years they were in charge of the seminary at Philadelphia. They have directed the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> seminary at <a href="02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a> from the beginning, and they have recently opened a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary at <a href="04733c.htm">Denver</a>. The <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> founded especially for training the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, besides their own <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and preparatory seminary in the <a href="02228a.htm">Archdiocese of Baltimore</a>, also opened and directed for some years the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> seminaries of <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a> and New York (Dunwoodie). They have also been in charge of the seminary of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> since its inception. The <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, in keeping with the tradition of their early <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, have trained students for the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> along with the members of their order at St. Vincent's, <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> (1846), St. Meinrad's, <a href="07738a.htm">Indiana</a> (1857), and Belmont, North Carolina (1878). The <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> have a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary connected with their college at Allegany, New York (1859). The Oblates have recently (1903) opened a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary at <a href="13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="14543a.htm">Texas</a>. In their colleges all over the country the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> have given to a large proportion of the American <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> their classical training; their Holy Cross College at <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a> has been since 1835 a nursery of the New England <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Moreover, not a few American <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> have received their <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training from the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of Innsbruck.</p>

<p>The growth of seminaries in America did not until recently keep pace with the need of priests; many have come from <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and other countries of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, while American students have sought their <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in the American colleges founded at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1857 and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1859, or in other institutions on the Continent. About two thousand American <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, moreover, have been <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in the Sulpician Seminary at <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. Of late years the need of preparatory seminaries has been more keenly felt, and we find them established in Rochester, <a href="07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, New York, and other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Some of these are merely day <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and, whilst having certain advantages, fail to effect the separation of aspirants to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from the world, as contemplated by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Since 1904 the annual meetings of the seminary department of the <a href="05305a.htm">Catholic Educational Association</a> have been found to be of great value in raising the standard of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. Carefully prepared papers have been read and discussed on the various topics of seminary training, such as entrance requirements, discipline, spiritual formation, and the method of teaching the various branches of the seminary curriculum: <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, dogmatic and <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and social problems.</p>

<h2 id="section5">Ecclesiastical legislation on seminaries</h2>

<h3 id="A">Sources</h3>

<p>The general <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on the subject of seminaries are found in the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and in various documents issued by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. At no time has the question of <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> training been the object of so much attention or brought forth so many decrees as under <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>. Some of their acts refer only to <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> seminaries, others to the whole Church. They will, doubtless, be embodied in the Code of Canon Law now in preparation. Meanwhile, the most important issued before 1908 may be found arranged in <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> order in M. Bargilliat's handy little volume "De Institutione Clericorum". In <a href="01640a.htm">Apostolic letters</a> to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (6 Jan., 1886), of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (22 Aug., 1886), of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (22 Dec., 1887), of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> (19 March, 1894) of <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a> (18 Sept., 1899), <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> insists on the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to establish seminaries where future <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> may be trained in <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>. The Various branches of study in the seminary were the object of special instructions. Thus he prescribed the study of St. Thomas's philosophy ("&AElig;terni Patris", 4 Aug., 1879), encouraged historical research (18 Aug., 1883), gave directions for Biblical studies ("Providentissimus Deus", 18 Nov., 1893), and instituted a special commission to foster them (30 Oct., 1902). Towards the end of his long pontificate he wrote two letters: one to the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the other to the <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (8 Sept., 1899 and 8 Dec., 1902), in which the training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> is treated at length.</p>

<p><a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> even more than his predecessor has taken a lively interest in the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. Convinced that the restoration of all things in Christ requires first of all the good training of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, he urged the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in his first <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> (4 Oct., 1903) to consider the care of their seminary as their first <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>. He himself has brought about various reforms in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Ecclesiastical students in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> must live in a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> and before <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> undergo an examination. As many <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> cannot support well-equipped seminaries, the Holy Father has suppressed some and united others. A central seminary has been opened at <a href="03319a.htm">Capua</a> and placed under the direction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; others have been entrusted to the <a href="10357a.htm">Vincentians</a>. In order to raise the standard of studies a detailed programme has been issued for all <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> seminaries: it prescribes a course of five years in the gymnasium, three years in the lyceum (philosophy), a year of preparation, and four years of study of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. To this has been added a set of regulations for the discipline and moral training of the students, in which no detail is omitted (10 May, 1907; 18 Jan., 1908). Other acts of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> extend not only to Italian but to all seminaries: they relate to the admission of students, to various branches of studies, etc.; they all tend to protect the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the students against <a href="10415a.htm">Modernistic</a> tendencies and to train a more learned and more <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. On the occasion of the golden jubilee of his <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> the Holy Father addressed to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the world (4 Aug., 1908) an exhortation which will remain the vade-mecum of seminarians and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, for it sets forth the ideal <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> life with the means by which it can be attained and preserved.</p>

<p>Special regulations for the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> were enacted in the second and third <a href="02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> in 1866 and 1884. These <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> leave undetermined many details of seminary discipline, which are left to the discretion of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Several methods, all based on the famous "Institutiones" of <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles</a> and varying only in non-essential points, have been and are still in force. Among them are those framed by <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, Blessed John Eudes, Father <a href="11240d.htm">Olier</a>, and <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>. None of these is imposed by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or generally adopted in all its details.</p>

<h3 id="B">Foundation of seminaries</h3>

<p>The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> imposes on every <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of having a seminary, that is, a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> exclusively destined to prepare candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. It should provide a thorough course of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> training, and therefore, according to present discipline, include academic, collegiate, and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> courses. The ideal <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> seminary is an institution like Overbrook (Philadelphia) or Menlo Park (San Francisco), where the future <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> are received from the grammar <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> and kept until <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, does not condemn, and <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> has expressly approved the separation of the preparatory from the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary; even in this case they are considered by law as forming but one <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institution, under the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> with the same advisory board. For the foundation and support of the seminary the tax on <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, authorized by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, is not practicable in America; the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has to depend on the generosity of the faithful; he may prescribe an annual collection or fix the amount to be contributed by each <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>. Poor <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> may combine their resources to found an interdiocesan seminary, to be controlled by the several <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> interested.</p>

<p>The controversy on the question of central versus <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> seminaries has never been raised in this country. It belongs only to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to decide whether it is practicable for a given diocese to have its separate seminary. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the majority of <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are now, and many will long remain, incapable of supporting a seminary. Interdiocesan seminaries, such as the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> recognizes and such as are now being established in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, are practically unknown. In their place there are seminaries such as St. Paul, Rochester, New York, founded and controlled by one <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but receiving students from other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; and likewise seminaries in charge of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders or <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> of <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, the students of which belong to various <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: such are St. Mary's and Mount St. Mary's (Baltimore), St. Vincent's (Pittsburg), Our Lady of Angels (Buffalo), etc. Though such institutions were not contemplated by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, they have the earnest approval of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.</p>

<h3 id="C">Obligation of seminary training</h3>

<p>A student could obtain all the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> by following classes in a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> and lectures in a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, without living in the seminary; but since the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a> and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> have constantly endeavoured to have candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> spend some time in a seminary so as to acquire, along with <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, habits of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and self-discipline. They have felt that the purpose of the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> would be defeated if residence in the seminary were left to the option of the students. It is the desire of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, based on the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and repeatedly expressed, especially by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, that future <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> be trained from early years apart from lay students. The same <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is enforced by the third <a href="02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, when it declares that the custom which obtains in some parts of the country of having aspirants to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> take their classical course in a mixed college is not in perfect harmony with the mind of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and when it urges the foundation of a preparatory seminary in every <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> or at least in every province (nos. 139, 153). Where this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> cannot be carried out, colleges receiving young men who study for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> must strictly observe the regulations prescribed for preparatory seminaries, relating to discipline, religious instruction, and the programme of studies (ibid., no. 153). With still greater insistence does the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> demand residence in a seminary from the students of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, even if they follow the lectures of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. Thus <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> has ordered all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to live in one of the colleges established for them; a similar instruction has been issued for the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students at <a href="06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>. The Council of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> required all aspirants to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to go through the six years of training prescribed for all American seminaries (no. 155). The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> can dispense in rare cases, and for grave reasons.</p>

<h3 id="D">External government of seminaries</h3>

<p>All matters referring to seminaries are under the supreme direction of the Consistorial Congregation in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Diocesan seminaries are controlled by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who appoints and removes professors, determines in detail the regulations to be followed, and watches over the temporal administration, studies, discipline, and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. Nothing of importance can be done without his advice and consent; to him belongs the final decision on the admission and dismissal of students, as well as on their call to orders. In provincial or interdiocesan seminaries this power is vested in the board of interested <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> seminaries, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is bound by the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to seek, though not bound to follow, in matters of temporal administration the advice of a commission composed of two canons of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (one chosen by himself, the other by the chapter) and of two other <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of the episcopal city, one chosen also by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the other by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. For spiritual matters the advice of two canons chosen by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is likewise <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> must have in the management of his seminary at least one adviser for spiritual matters, and another for temporal matters; both are chosen by himself with the advice of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors (Council of Baltimore, no. 180).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Although no text of ecclesiastical law forbids the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to entrust the direction of his seminary to a <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> order or congregation, this cannot be done without the approval of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> has no power to give up for himself and his successors the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> and teachers; neither can he set aside the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, requiring the advice of consultors in the management of the seminaries, while religious congregations in taking charge of a seminary assume the appointment of the faculty, and in governing it do not admit the interference of a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> commission. Several <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders or <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, however (Eudists, <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="09750b.htm">Marists</a>, <a href="11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>, <a href="13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>), have a general permission from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to accept the seminaries entrusted to them. A contract between the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> determines the conditions under which the seminary is accepted and must be governed (Council of Baltimore, no. 180).</p>

<h3 id="E">Internal administration of seminaries</h3>

<p>Two systems prevail. In one the management of the seminary is in the hands of the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, who alone under the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> governs the seminary, calls to orders, admits and dismisses the students; a treasurer has full charge of temporal matters, while to a <a href="05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> is entrusted the formation of the students in <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. The professors are merely teachers.</p>

<p>In the other system, all the professors have a share in the administration of the seminary; and all important matters are decided by a vote of the faculty. The professors are spiritual directors and confessors of the students. Of course, they have no voice in the faculty meetings when one of their penitents is concerned. A <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Holy Office (5 July, 1899) forbids superiors of seminaries and colleges in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to hear the confessions of their students. With the special organization of those colleges, such a practice could easily interfere with the liberty which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> assures to all in the sacred tribunal. Although this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> has not been officially extended beyond those colleges, its spirit should be observed in others similarly organized.</p>

<h3 id="F">Admission and dismissal of students</h3>

<p>"Let those be received", says the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, "who having been born in lawful wedlock, have at least attained their twelfth year, are able to read and write passably, and whose naturally good disposition gives token that they will always continue in the service of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>." It is the wish of the council that the children of the poor should be preferred. Today an ordinary grammar <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> instruction is required for admission into the preparatory seminaries. As regards vocation, all that can be expected is not indeed <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>, but probability. Still, preparatory seminaries must be maintained in their proper spirit, and receive only candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Parents and <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are urged to encourage and to help boys who by their intelligence and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> give hope that they are called to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (Council of Baltimore, no. 136). No one should be admitted to a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary unless he has completed a six-year collegiate course, and passed a successful examination (ibid., nos. 145, 152). A student from another diocese cannot be received without first obtaining information from his <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If it appears that he was dismissed from the seminary (as unfit for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>) he should not be admitted at all (Congregation of the Council, 22 Dec., 1905). Dismissal from the seminary means no more than that the student is not considered fit for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; it does not necessarily reflect on his character as a <a href="08748a.htm">Christian layman</a>.</p>

<h3 id="G">Intellectual training</h3>

<p>In the preparatory seminary the aspirant to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> follows the ordinary academic and collegiate course for six years; he studies <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, Latin and Greek, English and at least one other modern language, rhetoric and elocution, history and geography, mathematics and natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, <a href="06779a.htm">Gregorian Chant</a> and bookkeeping (Council of Baltimore, nos. 145, 151). <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges with a course of eight years, four years academic and four years collegiate, teach <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> in the junior and senior years; but as a rule this is not accepted by seminaries as the equivalent of two years of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The Council of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> requires <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students to spend six years in the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary. There they receive a special moral training which cannot be given in a mixed college, and they are taught <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> with a view to the study of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> seminary two years are devoted to the study of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Scripture, <a href="07365a.htm">Church history</a>, and natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> in their relation to religion. During the last four years the course of study includes <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, with Greek and Hebrew, <a href="01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, dogmatic, moral, and pastoral theology, <a href="07365a.htm">Church history</a>, and, in some institutions, liturgy and canon law. The courses given in these various branches have a twofold purpose: to equip every student with the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the discharge of the ordinary functions of the ministry; and to give brighter students the foundation of more scientific work, to be pursued in a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. The seminary trains general practitioners, the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> forms specialists; the seminary gives the elements of all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> provides a thorough treatment of some special questions. In <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students from various colleges follow a course of lectures at the Gregorian University, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> College, the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, or the Roman Seminary; these are supplemented by repetitions in the colleges (see <a href="13131a.htm">ROMAN COLLEGES</a>). There are likewise <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students preparing for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> who follow the courses of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the Universities of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and Fribourg, and in the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties of the German <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>. In the Catholic University at Washington there is only a post-graduate course of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in nearly all countries receive their <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in seminaries, and only at the end of the regular course are some of the best gifted sent to a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> to pursue higher studies, which lead to the degrees of licentiate and doctor. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, in their letters to <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in various parts of the world and in their Decrees regarding seminaries, insist that <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies be in harmony with the needs of our times, but free from all dangerous novelties, especially from the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> condemned under the name of <a href="10415a.htm">Modernism</a>. Various means have been taken to secure the perfect <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of both the professors and the students.</p>

<h3 id="H">Moral and spiritual training</h3>

<p>Unlike most of the professional <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> (law, medicine etc.) which give only <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the seminary aims at training the will. Like West Point and the Naval Academy it subjects the student to a system of discipline by which he may gradually acquire habits becoming his profession. In a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life is not less essential than professional <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. In order to discharge with success the functions of his ministry, he must be a gentleman, a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and moreover capable of bearing the special <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. "In order to restore in the world the reign of Jesus Christ", writes <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (5 May, 1904), "nothing is as <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> as the <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>." Hence, in his first <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> he warns the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> that their first care, to which every other must yield, ought to be "to form Christ in those who are to form Christ in others" (3 Oct., 1903).</p>

<p>Seminarians are to learn the <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> virtues first of all by the example of their teachers. Hence the <a href="12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a> and various councils frequently insist on the qualifications of those who are chosen to train <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. They should be "conspicuous for ability, learning, <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, seriousness of life. They should devote their life to study, bear cheerfully the burden of seminary rule and of a busy life; by word and example teach the students the observance of seminary discipline, <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>, unworldliness, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of work and retirement, and fidelity to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>" (Council of Baltimore, no. 159). Another powerful means of training seminarians in <a href="15472a.htm">Christian virtue</a> is the seminary discipline. The student is separated from the world and subjected to a rule of life which, leaving nothing to caprice, determines what he has to do at every moment of the day. Classes, studies, exercises of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> follow one another at regular intervals, and punctual attendance is expected of all. Fidelity to seminary rules, extending over several years, prompted by a sense of <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, and inspired by the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot fail to produce habits of regularity, self-control, and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>Instructions on <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>, on the dignity and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> are daily given in spiritual conferences and readings. These are supplemented by retreats, which take place in the beginning of the year and before ordinations, and by private consultations of each student with his <a href="05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>. Even more efficacious than instruction and discipline is the direct intercourse of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, meditation, and the reception of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Nowhere, perhaps, has the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on <a href="06278a.htm">frequent communion</a> produced more abundant fruit than in seminaries. The students gladly avail themselves of the special encouragement given to them to receive <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> daily. By this close communion with our great <a href="08374c.htm">High Priest</a>, even more than by their willing acceptance of all the restraints of seminary life, they gradually become worthy of the mission conferred upon them by <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Thus the seminary becomes a nursery of faithful representatives of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> for the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men; they go forth, the light of the world and the salt of the earth.</p>

<p>History fully bears out the words of the learned historian and great <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Hefele: "If the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world has had for the last three hundred years a more learned, a more moral, a more <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> than that which existed in almost every country at the time of the so-called <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and whose tepidity and faithlessness contributed largely to the growth of the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, it is wholly due to this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and to it we in this age owe our thanks" ("T&uuml;binger Quartalschrift", no. 1, p. 24).</p>
