<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The German <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> Rationalism formed a part of the more general movement of the eighteenth-century "Enlightenment". It may be said to owe its immediate origin to the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system of Christian Wolff (1679-1754), which was a modification, with <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> features, of that of Leibniz, especially characterized by its spiritualism, determinism, and dogmatism. This philosophy and its method exerted a profound influence upon contemporaneous German <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> thought, providing it with a rationalistic point of view in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. German philosophy in the eighteenth century was, as a whole, tributary to Leibniz, whose "Th&eacute;odic&eacute;e" was written principally against the Rationalism of Bayle: it was marked by an infiltration of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="04679b.htm">Deism</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, to which the Rationalism at present considered had great affinity, and towards which it progressively developed: and it was vulgarized by its union with popular literature. Wolff himself was expelled from his chair at the University of Halle on account of the Rationalistic nature of his teaching, principally owing to the action of Lange (1670-1774; cf. "Causa Dei et religionis naturalis adversus atheismum", and "Modesta Disputatio", Halle, 1723). Retiring to Marburg, he taught there until 1740, when he was recalled to Halle by <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. Wolff's attempt to demonstrate natural religion rationally was in no sense an attack upon revelation. As a "supranaturalist" he admitted <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> above reason, and he attempted to support by reason the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> contained in <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. But his attempt, while it incensed the pietistic <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> and was readily welcomed by the more liberal and moderate among the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, in reality turned out to be strongly in favour of the <a href="10713a.htm">Naturalism</a> that he wished to condemn. Natural religion, he asserted, is demonstrable; <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="12738a.htm">religion</a> is to be found in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> alone. But in his method of <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the authority of Scripture recourse was had to reason, and thus the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> became, <a href="09324a.htm">logically</a>, the ultimate arbiter in the case of both. Supranaturalism in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, which it was Wolff's intention to uphold, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> incompatible with such a <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> position, and Rationalism took its place. This, however, is to be distinguished from pure <a href="10713a.htm">Naturalism</a>, to which it led, but with which it never became theoretically identified. Revelation was not denied by the Rationalists; though, as a matter of fact, if not of theory, it was quietly suppressed by the claim, with its ever-increasing application, that reason is the competent judge of all <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. Naturalists, on the other hand, denied the fact of revelation. As with <a href="04679b.htm">Deism</a> and <a href="10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, the German Rationalism invaded the department of <a href="05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a>. Here a destructive criticism, very similar to that of the <a href="04679b.htm">Deists</a>, was levelled against the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> recorded in, and the authenticity of the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Nevertheless, the distinction between Rationalism and <a href="10713a.htm">Naturalism</a> still obtained. The great Biblical critic Semler (1725-91), who is one of the principal representatives of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, was a strong opponent of the latter; in company with Teller (1734-1804) and others he endeavoured to show that the records of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> have no more than a local and temporary character, thus attempting to safeguard the deeper revelation, while sacrificing to the critics its superficial vehicle. He makes the distinction between <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and religion (by which he signifies ethics).</p>

<p>The distinction made between natural and <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="12738a.htm">religion</a> necessitated a closer definition of the latter. For Supernaturalists and Rationalists alike religion was held to be "a way of knowing and worshipping the Deity", but consisting chiefly, for the Rationalists, in the observance of <a href="09071a.htm">God's law</a>. This identification of religion with <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, which at the time was <a href="15241c.htm">utilitarian</a> in character (<em>see</em> <a href="15241c.htm">UTILITARIANISM</a>), led to further developments in the conceptions of the nature of religion, the meaning of revelation, and the value of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> as a collection of inspired writings. The earlier <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> view of religion as a body of <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> published and taught by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to man in revelation was in process of disintegration. In Semler's distinction between religion (ethics) on the one hand and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> on the other, with <a href="07251c.htm">Herder's</a> similar separation of religion from <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions and religious usages, the cause of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, as they conceived it, seemed to be put beyond the reach of the shock of criticism, which, by destroying the foundations upon which it claimed to rest, had gone so far to discredit the older form of <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. <a href="08603a.htm">Kant's</a> (1724-1804) criticism of the reason, however, formed a turning-point in the development of Rationalism. For a full understanding of his attitude, the reader must be acquainted with the nature of his pietistic upbringing and later scientific and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> formation in the Leibniz-Wolff school of thought (see <a href="08603a.htm">PHILOSOPHY OF KANT</a>). As far as concerns the point that occupies us at present, <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> was a Rationalist. For him religion was coextensive, with natural, though not <a href="15241c.htm">utilitarian</a>, <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>. When he met with the criticisms of Hume and undertook his famous "Kritik", his preoccupation was to safeguard his religious opinions, his rigorous morality, from the danger of criticism. This he did, not by means of the old Rationalism, but by throwing discredit upon <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>. The accepted <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and liberty were thus, in his opinion, overthrown, and the well-known set of postulates of the "categoric imperative" put forward in their place. This, obviously, was the end of Rationalism in its earlier form, in which the fundamental <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> of religion were set out as demonstrable by reason. But, despite the shifting of the burden of religion from the pure to the practical reason, <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> himself never seems to have reached the view --; to which all his work pointed --; that religion is not mere ethics, "conceiving moral laws as divine commands", no matter how far removed from <a href="15241c.htm">Utilitarianism</a> --; not an affair of the mind, but of the heart and will; and that revelation does not reach man by way of an exterior <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, but consists in a personal adaptation towards <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. This conception was reached gradually with the advance of the theory that man possesses a religious sense, or faculty, distinct from the rational (Fries, 1773-1843; Jacobi, 1743-1819; Herder, 1744-1803; &#151; all opposed to the Intellectualism of <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a>), and ultimately found expression with Schleiermacher (1768-1834), for whom religion is to be found neither in <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> nor in action, but in a peculiar attitude of mind which consists in the consciousness of absolute dependence upon <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Here the older distinction between natural and <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="12738a.htm">religion</a> disappears. All that can be called religion &#151; the consciousness of dependence &#151; is at the same time revelational, and all religion is of the same character. There is no special revelation in the older <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> (the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>) sense, but merely this attitude of dependence brought into being in the individual by the teaching of various great personalities who, from time to time, have manifested an extraordinary sense of the religious. Schleiermacher was a contemporary of Fichte, Schelling, and <a href="07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, whose philosophical speculations had influence, with his own, in ultimately subverting Rationalism as here dealt with. The movement may be said to have ended with him &#151; in the opinion of Teller "the greatest <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> that the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a> has had since the period of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>". The majority of modern <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> accept his views, not, however, to the exclusion of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as a basis of religion.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Parallel with the development of the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> views as to the nature of religion and the worth of revelation, which provided it with its critical principles, took place an <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> evolution. The first phase consisted in replacing the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (i.e. that the <a href="../bible.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> are the Word of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>) by a distinction between the Word of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> contained in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> and the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> itself (T&ouml;llner, <a href="07251c.htm">Herder</a>), though the Rationalists still held that the purer source of revelation lies rather in the written than in the traditional word. This distinction led inevitably to the destruction, of the rigid view of inspiration, and prepared the ground for the second phase. The principle of accommodation was now employed to explain the difficulties raised by the Scripture records of <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> events and <a href="04710a.htm">demoniacal</a> manifestations (Senf, Vogel), and arbitrary methods of <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> were also used to the same end (Paulus, Eichhorn). In the third phase Rationalists had reached the point of allowing the possibility of mistakes having been made by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles, at any rate with regard to non-essential parts of religion. All the devices of <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> were employed vainly; and, in the end, Rationalists found themselves forced to admit that the authors of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> must have written from a point of view different from that which a modern <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> would adopt (Henke, Wegseheider). This principle, which is sufficiently elastic to admit of usage by nearly every variety of opinion, was admitted by several of the Supernaturalists (Reinhard, Storr), and is very generally accepted by modern <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> divines, in the rejection of verbal inspiration. <a href="07251c.htm">Herder</a> is very clear on the distinction &#151; the truly inspired must be discerned from that which is not; and de Wette lays down as the canon of interpretation "the religious perception of the divine operation, or of the Holy Spirit, in the sacred writers as regards their <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> and inspiration, but not respecting their faculty of forming <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. . ." In an extreme form it may be seen employed in such works as Strauss's "Leben Jesu", where the hypothesis of the mythical nature of <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> is developed to a greater extent than by Schleiermacher or de Wette.</p>

<p>Rationalism, in the broader, popular meaning of the term, is used to designate any mode of thought in which <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="12673b.htm">reason</a> holds the place of supreme criterion of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>; in this sense, it is especially applied to such modes of thought as contrasted with <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. Thus <a href="02040a.htm">Atheism</a>, <a href="10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, <a href="10713a.htm">Naturalism</a>, <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, Scepticism, etc., fall under the head of rationalistic systems. As such, the rationalistic tendency has always existed in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and has generally shown itself powerful in all the critical <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. As has been noted in the preceding paragraph, German Rationalism had strong affinities with <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="04679b.htm">Deism</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, two historic forms in which the tendency has manifested itself. But with the vulgarization of the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> contained in the various systems that composed these movements, Rationalism has degenerated. It has become connected in the popular mind with the shallow and misleading philosophy frequently put forward in the name of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, so that a double confusion has arisen, in which;</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li> questionable <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> speculations are taken for scientific facts, and</li><li> <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> is falsely supposed to be in opposition to religion.</li></ul></div>

<p>This Rationalism is now rather a spirit, or attitude, ready to seize upon any arguments, from any source and of any or no value, to urge against the doctrines and practices of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. Beside this crude and popular form it has taken, for which the publication of cheap reprints and a vigorous propaganda are mainly responsible, there runs the deeper and more thoughtful current of critical-philosophical Rationalism, which either rejects religion and revelation altogether or treats them in much the same manner as did the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a>. Its various manifestations have little in common in method or content, save the general appeal to reason as supreme. No better description of the position can be given than the statements of the objects of the Rationalist Press Association. Among these are: "To stimulate the habits of reflection and inquiry and the free exercise of individual <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> . . . and generally to assert the supremacy of reason as the natural and <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> means to all such <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and wisdom as man can achieve". A perusal of the publications of the same will show in what sense this representative body interprets the above statement. It may be said finally, that Rationalism is the direct and <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> outcome of the principles of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>; and that the intermediary form, in which assent is given to <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> as possessing the <em>imprimatur</em> of reason, is only a phase in the evolution of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> towards general disbelief. Official condemnations of the various forms of Rationalism, absolute and mitigated, are to be found in the Syllabus of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section3">III</h2>

<p>The term <em>Rationalism</em> is perhaps not usually applied to the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> method of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. All forms of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> statement, however, and pre-eminently the <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> form of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, are rationalistic in the truest sense. Indeed, the claim of such Rationalism as is dealt with above is directly met by the counter claim of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>: that it is at best but a mutilated and unreasonable Rationalism, not worthy of the name, while that of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is rationally complete, and integrated, moreover, with super-rational <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. In this sense <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> presupposes the certain <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> of natural reason as the <em>preambula fidei</em>, philosophy (the <em>ancilla theologi&aelig;</em>) is employed in the defence of <a href="13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> (see <a href="01618a.htm">APOLOGETICS</a>), and the content of <a href="13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> is treated and systematized in the categories of natural thought. This systematization is carried out both in dogmatic and <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. It is a process contemporaneous with the first attempt at a scientific statement of religious <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, comes to perfection of method in the works of such writers as <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> and <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>, and is consistently employed and developed in the Schools.</p>
