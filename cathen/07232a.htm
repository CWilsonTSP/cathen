<p>German King and Roman Emperor, son of <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a>; b. in 1081; d. at <a href="15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, 23 May, 1125.</p>

<p>He was a crafty, sullen man, of far from blameless <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>; but he defended tenaciously the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Crown and, by his qualities as a ruler, the most conspicuous of which were <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and energy, he achieved important results. His harshness and want of consideration for others made him numerous enemies.</p>

<p>Henry V ascended the throne under a compact with the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the territorial princes, that is, with his <a href="07230a.htm">father's</a> bitterest opponents. Yet he had scarcely taken up the reins of government when he forthwith adopted the very policy which his <a href="07230a.htm">father</a> had pursued. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that he saw fit to preserve toward <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> a semblance of ready submission, but he was by no means disposed to give up the royal prerogatives over the German <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, least of all the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="08084b.htm">investiture</a>. All negotiations opened to this end by <a href="11514b.htm">Paschal II</a>, who was too sanguine of results, remained barren failures.</p>

<p>In 1110, Henry, accompanied by a numerous army, set out for the imperial <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, though rather aggressive in temperament, was quick to lose heart, and deemed that a new conflict with this German king, who now appeared with such imposing array, would be fraught with the most serious danger. Disregarding totally the lessons of history, he suggested a radical measure, the aim of which was to end once for all the <a href="08084c.htm">great strife</a> between <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor. He determined to realize the <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> ideal of a <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> free from all worldly entanglements. Therefore <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, the entire German <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, were to surrender to the king all their worldly possessions and <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. The king was to abandon in return the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="08084b.htm">investiture</a>, henceforth worthless. The latter, who saw nothing but gain in this proposal, accepted the offer. He was too shrewd not to realize that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> plan was impossible of execution. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that he had no serious <a href="08069b.htm">intention</a> of depriving of their possessions the ecclesiastical lords and their vassals, while he attached much importance to the unequivocal way in which the king's <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> to the <a href="12462a.htm">temporal possessions</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> were to be recognized. However, no actual agreement was ever reached.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The German princes in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on reading the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> proposition, openly proclaimed their disapproval. Henry, after this vehement protest, demanded of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="08084b.htm">investiture</a> and the imperial crown. As the latter refused both, he carried him off a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Yielding to force, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed to Henry's demands, and at the same time <a href="11176a.htm">swore</a> that he would never <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> him. Henry, after this success, returned to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He stopped on the way back, to visit Countess Matilda of Tuscany, who made him the heir of all her estates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the followers of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> resumed their activity. The weakness of <a href="11514b.htm">Paschal</a> was loudly denounced. The <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="03185a.htm">Guido of Vienne</a>, declared <a href="08084b.htm">investiture</a> a <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the king. And as had happened in the days of the latter's father, this attack of the reform party on Henry found support in the opposition of the German princes. As so often in the past, <a href="13497b.htm">Saxon</a> particularism again manifested itself. In <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, the last male heir of the House of Billung had died. The new duke, Lothair of Supplinberg, placed himself at the head of a strong movement against the king, who did not meet this attack with equal vigour.</p>

<p>The years 1114 and 1115 brought the uprising to a critical phase for Henry, who was defeated at Welfesholze, near Mansfeld, whereupon the traditional thirst for independence reasserted itself on many sides. First one and then another of the German ecclesiastical princes <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the king. A <a href="09118a.htm">papal envoy</a> made his appearance in <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. Henry, despite the seriousness of this situation, hastened to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> on learning the death of Countess Matilda in 1116, and led his army towards <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> fled and sought refuge among his friends, the Normans. The German ruler was favourably received by the Romans, had himself <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor at St. Peter's (1117), and at once set out to restore order in Upper <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="05421b.htm">endowment</a> of cities with <a href="12436b.htm">privileges</a>, coupled with his gifts to the Italian nobles, enabled him to carry out his plans. He took possession of the hereditary lands of Countess Matilda, and thus strengthened his power in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>

<p>In 1119, Henry's most outspoken adversary, Guido of Vienne, ascended the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>. The emperor perceived that the conflict was to begin anew with fresh <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a>, and in order the better to protect himself, determined to put an end to internal dissensions in his empire by a treaty of peace. But he failed to achieve this until the Diet of W&uuml;rzburg, in 1121. Preliminary negotiations here resulted in an agreement that final peace should depend on a treaty between <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor. Thus was the way prepared for the important Diet of Worms, which assembled in September, 1122. The distinction between the conferring of an ecclesiastical office and the conferring of temporal possessions was relied on at Worms to bring about peace.</p>

<p>Henry's skill as a diplomat proved particularly notable at this juncture, and was not the least influential factor in bringing about the <a href="04196a.htm">concordat</a> of 23 September, 1122 (see <a href="03185a.htm">CALLISTUS II</a>). This famous agreement provided that the emperor should surrender his <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to the selection of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> in the empire, but that he should be authorized to send a representative to the ecclesiastical <a href="11456a.htm">elections</a>. Accordingly, the German sovereign was furthermore to abandon the symbolical <a href="13059a.htm">ring</a> and <a href="04515c.htm">crosier</a> at an <a href="08084b.htm">investiture</a>; but he retained the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to confer their temporal possessions on the ecclesiastical princes by investing them with a sceptre, and this was to be done before the bishop-elect received the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. In <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> alone was this <a href="08084b.htm">investiture</a> to follow within six weeks of the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. This just and natural solution of the great controversy could, with the proper good will, have been brought about at a much earlier <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>.</p>

<p>Like all compromises it had its defects, and was obscure in certain respects. To this day, the learned do not agree as to the important question whether or not the <a href="04196a.htm">concordat</a> was a personal agreement with Henry or with the empire as such. It is assumed, however, that the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> which it created were to be permanent. Was it a victory for the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> or for the empire? To answer this question one must bear in mind, so far as the empire is concerned, that the <a href="11354a.htm">Ottonic</a> system of government, a principle of which was the dependency of the German <a href="02581b.htm">episcopate</a> on the Crown, and which made use of the German <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in striving to keep down the particularistic elements, was now seriously undermined. The subordination of the princes was already virtually done away with, and could only be enforced with difficulty.</p>

<p>It is well to consider that in these protracted struggles between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, in which rebellion often assumed the garb of religion, the power of the German princes was vitally strengthened. It was also significant that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were henceforth no longer to be named by the king, whose relations with the episcopate had hitherto been almost those of lord and vassals. A new community of interests bound together for the future the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and temporal princes. The crown found itself face to face with a closed phalanx of territorial magnates, so that the termination of the controversy brought no advantage to the German imperial power. Henry, nevertheless, secured all that was possible under the circumstances, and he saved for the royal power the possibility of future recovery.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="04196a.htm">Concordat</a> of Worms did not eliminate altogether the differences existing between the empire and the territorial princes. King Henry's marriage had brought him no issue, and the German princes now claimed their <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to elect his successor. How they would use this <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> could not be foretold. In 1123, Henry was compelled once more to enter the lists against Lothair and the Saxons. The emperor's capacity as a ruler again appeared when, towards the close of his reign, he laid bare the weakest point in the constitution of the Empire, and earnestly tried to heal it by perfecting a plan for levying <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> taxes. But any effort to improve the finances of the central royal authority was opposed by the territorial princes. Henry was the last of the Salic kings.</p>
