<p>(Russian <em>raskolnik</em>, a <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, a dissenter; from <em>raskol</em>, <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, splitting; that in turn from <em>raz</em>, apart, and <em>kolot'</em>, to split; plural, <em>raskolniki</em>).</p>

<p>A generic term for dissidents from the Established Church in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Under the name <em>Raskolniki</em>, the various offshoots and <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> bodies originating from the <a href="11329a.htm">Greek Orthodox Church</a> of the <a href="13231c.htm">Russian Empire</a> have been grouped by Russian historians and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers. Strictly speaking, the name <em>Raskolniki</em> refers merely to those who have kept the outward forms of the <a href="04312d.htm">Byzantine Rite</a>; the others who have deserted its ritual as well as its teaching are grouped under the name <em>Sekstanstvo</em> (sectarianism). In the present article they are both treated together, since either form of dissent is but slightly known outside of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Raskolniks</em> represent in the Russian Church somewhat the antithesis of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> toward the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> left the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> because they claimed a desire to reform it by dropping <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, and rites; the Raskolniks left the Russian church because they desired to keep alive the minutest rites and practices to which they were accustomed, and objected to the Russian Church reforming them in any respect. In doing so they fell into the greatest of inconsistencies, and a section of them, while keeping up the minuti&aelig; of ritual, rejected nearly every <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> taught throughout the world.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section1">True Raskolniks</h2>

<p>Even from the time that the Russians were <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there were various dissident <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> among them, reproducing in some respect the almost forgotten <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the early ages of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. These are mere names today, but the main separation from the Russian Established church came in 1654 when <a href="11077b.htm">Nikon</a>, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, convened a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> at <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a> for the reform of rituals and the correction of the church books. At the time the air in Southern <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> was filled with the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in Central and Northern Russian there was the fear of the Polish invasion and the turning to Latin customs. When <a href="11077b.htm">Nikon</a> corrected the church service books, into which many <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> had crept through careless copying, and conformed them with the original Greek text, great complaint was expressed that he was departing from old Slavonic hallowed words, and was making cause with the stranger outside of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. When he undertook to change the style of popular forms and ceremonies, such as the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, the spelling and pronunciation of <a href="07421a.htm">"Jesus"</a>, shaving the <a href="02362a.htm">beard</a>, or to differ in the number of <a href="01319b.htm">Alleluias</a> before the <a href="06659a.htm">Gospel</a>, he aroused popular resentment, which rose until there came an open break in which every point he proposed was rejected. Afterwards when Peter the Great came to the throne (1689-1725) and introduced western customs, abolished the Patriarchate of <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, substituted the Holy Synod and made himself the head of Church authority, changed the form of the ancient Russo-Slavonic letters, and set on foot a host of new things in <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, the followers of the old order of things publicly condemned him as the <a href="01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> and renounced the State Church forever, while clinging to the older forms of their fathers. But both <a href="11077b.htm">Nikon</a> and Peter had the whole Russian episcopate with them, as well as the great majority of the Russian <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. The dissenters who thus separated from the established Greco-Russian Orthodox church became also known as <em>Stariobriodtsi</em> (old Ritualists) and <em>Staroviertsi</em> (old Believers), in allusion to their adherence to the forms and teaching prevailing before <a href="11077b.htm">Nikon's</a> reforms.</p>

<p>As none of the Russian <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> seceded from the Established Church the Raskolniks therefore had but an incomplete form of Church. Of course a number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> adhered to them, but as they had no <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> they could not provide new members of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Soon death began to thin the ranks of their <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and it became apparent that within a brief period they would be left without any <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> whatever. Then some of their leaders began to deny that a <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> at all. This lead to the splitting of the Raskolniks into two distinct branches: the <em>Popovsti</em> (priestly, i.e., "Pope"-ly), who insisted on the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and the <em>Bezpopovsti</em> (Priestless, i.e., without "Popes") who denied the necessity of any <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> whatever. The latter, however, accepted their ministrations. The fortunes of these two <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> or <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> were quite different. The former grew to great importance in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and are now said to have between thirteen and fifteen millions of adherents. The latter subdivided again and again into smaller <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>, and are said to number between three and four million, all included. They will be taken up separately.</p>

<h3>Popovtsi or Hierarchical Raskolniks</h3>

<p>At first these renewed their <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> by taking over dissatisfied or dismissed <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from the established <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, after having them take an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> against all the reforms instituted by <a href="11077b.htm">Nikon</a> and Peter; but this method was hardly satisfactory, for in most cases the material thus obtained was of low moral grade. They believed that the whole Russian episcopate had gone over to <a href="01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, but were still valid <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and hence endeavoured to have <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by them, but in vain. They searched the Eastern world for a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> who held their particular <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and it seemed almost they must eventual change for lack of <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, when chance aided them. A community of <em>Popovtsi</em> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> had settles at Bielo-krinitsa (White fountain) in Bukowina. Ambrose (1791-1863), a Greek <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13725a.htm">Sarajevo</a> in Bosnia, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. Subsequently a later patriarch deposed him, and when his resentful feelings against the a Constantinople authorities were at their height, the Raskolniks approached him with the request to become their <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. On 16 April, 1846, Ambrose agreed to go over to their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and adopt all the ancient practices, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for them, and become their <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> or <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. On 27 October, 1846, he was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> received in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bielo-krinitsa, took the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a>, celebrated <a href="12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a> and assumed episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Bielo-krinitsa is only a few miles from the Russian border, and a <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was soon brought into being for <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. After <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and Turkey, <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and installed in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The Russian government could not crush the head of the Raskol Church, for it was in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The <em>Popovsti</em> grew by leaps and bounds, commenced to provide for a regular <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and vied with the established church. At present they have, since the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of toleration in 1905, a well-established <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> with a Metropolitan in <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Saratoff, Perm, Kazan, Caucasus, Samara, Kolomea, Nijni-Novgorod, Smolensk, Vyatka, and Kaluga.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Their chief stronghold is the Rogozhsky quarter in <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, where they have their great cemetery, <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, church, and <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>. In 1863, at the time of the Polish insurrection, the Raskolnik <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and his lay advisors sent out an <a href="05413a.htm">encyclical</a> letter to the "Holy Catholic Apostolic Church of the Old Believers", supporting the tsar and declaring that on all main points they were in agreement with the Established Church. This again split their church into two factions which last to this day: the <em>Okruzhniki</em> or Encyclicalists, and the <em>Raznordiki</em> or Controversialists, who denied the points of agreement with the national Church. In addition to this the Established Church has set up a section of these Raskolniks in union with it, but has permitted them to keep all their peculiar practices, and these are called the <em>Yedinovertsi</em> or "Uniates". A great many of the Controversial section of the Raskolniks are coming into the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and already some eight or ten <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> have been received.</p>

<p><em>Bezpopovtsi</em>, or the <em>Priestless</em>, seemed to represent the despairing side of the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. They have their greatest stronghold in the Preobrazhenky quarter in <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and are strong also in the Government of Archangel. They took the view that <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a> had so far conquered and throttled the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> that the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> had gone wrong and had become his servants, that the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, except <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, were withdrawn from the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, and that they were left leaderless. They claimed the right of free interpretation of the Scriptures, and modelling their lives accordingly. They recognize no <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> save their "readers" who are elected. Lest this be said to duplicate <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> it must be said that they have kept up all the Orthodox forms of service as far as possible, crossings, bowings, icons, candles, fastings, and the like, and have regularly maintained <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with their <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. But they have no element of stability; and their <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> have become innumerable, ever shifting and varying, with incessant divisions and subdivisions. The chief of these subdivisions are: (1) <em>Pomortsi</em>; or dwellers near the sea, a rural division which is very devout; (2) <em>Feodocci</em> (Theodosians) who founded <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and laid emphasis on <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>; (3) <em>Bezbrachniki</em> (free lovers) who repudiated marriage, somewhat like the Oneida community in New York; (4) <em>Stranniki</em> (wanderers) a peripatetic <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, who went over the country, declaring their doctrines; (5) <em>Molchalniki</em> (mutes), who seldom spoke, <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> came through the tongue and idle conversation; and (6) <em>Niemoliaki</em> (non-praying) who taught that, as <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> knows all things it is useless to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> to him, as He knows what one needs. These various divisions of the priestless are again divided into smaller ones, like many of the strange <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and America, so that it is almost impossible to follow them. Often they indulge in the wildest immorality, justifying it under the cover of some distorted text of Scripture or some phrase of the ancient Church service.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Sectarians</h2>

<p>The various bodies which make up the <em>Sektanstvo</em> have seceded from the national Russian Church quite independently of the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> at the time of <a href="11077b.htm">Nikon</a> and the reform in the church books. They correspond more closely with the various <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> arising from <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and are founded upon some distorted <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, or a rule of life of doctrines of the Faith. Some of them are older than the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, but most of them are later in point of time. The principal ones comprise between one and two millions and may be subdivided, or classified as follows: (1) <em>Khylsti</em> (<a href="06089c.htm">Flagellants</a>), who <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in severe penances, reject the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, its <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and usages. They also are called the <em>Ludi Bozhi</em>, or "God's People", and also the "Farmazoni" (<a href="09771a.htm">Freemasons</a>) on account of the secret initiations they have. They hold secret meetings in which they sing wild, stirring <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, dress in white, and jump, dance, or whirl, much like the <a href="12627a.htm">negro</a> revivals in the Southern States.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Skoptsi</em> (Eunuchs), who not only teach absolute <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, but mutilate themselves so as to be sexless. They boast that they are pure like the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and walk untainted through this world of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and take the literal view of <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs12">Matthew 19:12</a>. <a href="15687b.htm">Women</a> are also mutilated, particularly after they have borne children to recruit the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, but these children are not born in wedlock. The <em>Skoptsi</em> are said to be <a href="15235c.htm">usurers</a> and money changers.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Molokani</em> (Milk-drinkers) said to be so named because they make it a point to drink milk and use other prohibited foods during <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> and fast days, to show their objection to the Orthodox church. They abhor all external ceremonies of religion, but lay stress upon the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>. They say there is no teacher of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> but Christ himself, and that we are all priests; and they carry their <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a> so far as to have neither church nor <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, simply meeting in one anothers' houses.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Dukhobors</em> (Spirit wrestlers) are those who deny the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and place but a minor importance on the Scriptures. They are better known to America, for some thousands of them <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, where they are now good colonists. They give a wide place to tradition, and designate a man as "the living book", in opposition to dead books of paper and ink. In some respects they are pantheists, saying that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> lies within us, that we must struggle with the <a href="07409a.htm">spirit of God</a> to attain the fullness of life. They do not give an historical reality to the gospel narratives, but take them figuratively. Their <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is in conformity with their <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>; they consider it an assembly of the righteous on earth, whether <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or <a href="10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. Yet they have all the peculiarities and fanaticism of the <a href="14042a.htm">Slav</a>.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Stundists</em>, or a kind of Russian <a href="02278a.htm">Baptist</a>. These seem to be an offshoot of the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> or <a href="10190b.htm">Mennonites</a> who settled in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Their name is derived from the German <em>Stunde</em>, or hour, because they assembled at stated hours to read the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> or worship. They rejected the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, even <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> at first, yet retain it. They gave up all <a href="06021b.htm">Christian holidays</a>, and agreed with the <em>Melokani</em> in repudiating the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. They are nearly all Little Russians, in the South of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>.</p>

<p>(6) <em>Subbotniki</em> (<a href="13287a.htm">Sabbatarians</a>), who have substituted Saturday, the Jewish <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, for Sunday. They have also taken up a great many practices from the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> along with such elemental forms which they retain. They are practically <a href="15154b.htm">Unitarians</a>, and expect the <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a>; and they are also said to be like the <a href="10570c.htm">Mormons</a>, living in <a href="02564a.htm">polygamy</a> in many instances, although most of them are content with one wife.</p>

<p>Besides these principal <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> there are numerous smaller ones. One can almost run the same round of strange and erratic religious <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a> in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> as in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. There are the <em>Pliassuny</em> (Dancers), <em>Samobogi</em> (Self-gods), <em>Chisleniki</em> (Computers), who have changed Sunday so as to fall on Wednesday, and <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> to the middle of the week, <em>Pashkovites, Radstockites</em> (so named after their founders), and numerous others, which exploit some peculiar tenant of their various founders and believers. In addition to those are the various missionary enterprises and local churches of <a href="12495a.htm">Western Protestantism</a>, of which the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and <a href="02278a.htm">Baptists</a> are the leading ones.</p>
