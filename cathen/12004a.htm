<p>Surnamed Le Bel (the Fair)</p>

<p>King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, b. at Fontainebleau, 1268; d. there, 29 Nov., 1314; son of Philip III and Isabel of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>; became king, 5 Oct. 1285, on the death of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, 6 Jan., 1286, with his wife Jeanne, daughter of Henry I, King of Navarre, Count of Champagne and Brie; this marriage united these territories to the royal domain. Having taken Viviers and Lyons from the empire, Valenciennes, the inhabitants of which united themselves <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, La Marche and Angoumois, which he seized from the lawful heirs of Hugues de Lusigan, Philip whished to expel Edward I of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> from Guienne, all of which province, with the exception of <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> and <a href="02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>, was occupied in 1294 and 1295. By the Treaty of Montreuil, negotiated by <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, he gave Guienne as a gift to his daughter Isabel, who married the son of Edward I, on condition that this young prince should hold the province as Philip's vassal. Philip wished to punish Count Guy of <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, an ally of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and caused Charles of Valois to invade his territory, but he was defeated at Coutrai by the Flemings, who were roused by the heavy taxes imposed on them by Philip; he took his revenge on the Flemings at the naval victory of Zierichzee and the land victory of Mons en Puelle; then in 1305 he recognized Robert, Guy's son, as his vassal and retained possession of <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a>, <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a>, Orchies and Valenciennes. Having thus extended his kingdom, Philip endeavored energetically to centralize the government and impose a very rigorous fiscal system. Legists like Enguerrand, Philippe de Marigny, Pierre de Latilly, Pierre Flotte, Raoul de Presle, and Guillaume de Plassan, helped him to establish firmly this royal absolutism and set up a tyrannical power.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>These legists were called the <em>chevaliers de l'h&ocirc;tel,</em> the <em>chevaliers &egrave;s lois,</em> the <em>milites regis;</em> they were not nobles, neither did they bear arms, but they ranked as <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a>. The appearance of these legists in the Government of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> is one of the leading events of the reign of Philip IV. Renan explains its significance in these words: "An entirely new class of politicians, owing their fortune entirely to their own merit and personal efforts, unreservedly devoted to the king who had made them, and rivals of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose place they hoped to fill in many matters, thus appeared in the history of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and were destined to work a profound change in the conduct of public affairs."</p>

<p>It was these legists who incited and supported Philip IV in his conflict with the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the trial of the <a href="14493a.htm">Templars</a>. In the articles <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>; <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a>; Molai; <a href="14493a.htm">Templars</a>, will be found an account of the relations of Philip IV with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; M. Lizerand, in 1910, has given us a study on Philip IV and <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, containing thirty-seven unpublished letters written by the two sovereigns. The principal adviser of Philip in his hostile relations with the <a href="13147a.htm">Curia</a> was the legist <a href="11089a.htm">Guillaume de Nogaret</a>. Renan, who made a close study of <a href="11089a.htm">Nogaret's</a> dealings with <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, and the <a href="14493a.htm">Templars</a>, thinks that despite his ardent profession of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> fidelity he was somewhat <a href="07610a.htm">hypocritical</a>, at all events "he was not an honest man," and that "he could not have been deceived by the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> testimony which he stirred up and the sophisms he provoked." <a href="11089a.htm">Nogaret's</a> methods of combating <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> and the <a href="14493a.htm">Templars</a> are better understood when we examine, in Gaston Paris's work, the curious trial of Guichard, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, for <a href="15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>.</p>

<p>Another important personage whose curious writings must be read to understand the policy of Philip correctly is Pierre Dubois. He had been a pupil of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> at the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and was a lawyer at <a href="04455b.htm">Coutances</a>. In 1300 Dubois wrote a work on the means of shortening the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> and conflicts of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; in 1302 he published several virulent pamphlets against <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>; between 1304 and 1308, he wrote a very important work "De recuperatione Terrae Sanctae"; in 1309 alone, he wrote on the question of the Holy Roman Empire, on the Eastern question, and against the <a href="14493a.htm">Templars</a>. Dubois started from the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> ought to subdue the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, after which ti would be easy for the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to use the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> influence for his own advantage. He whished his king to become master of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, to administer them, to reduce the castles and cities of this state to his obedience, and to force <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, vassal countries of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, to do homage to the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; in return the king was to grant the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the revenues of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. "It depends on the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>," wrote he in his work of 1302, "to rid himself of his worldly occupations and to preserve his revenues without having any trouble about them; if he does not wish to accept such an advantageous offer, he will incur universal reproach for his cupidity, <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a>, and rash presumption." "Clement V," continued Dubois in his treatise "De recuperation Terrae Sanctae," "after having given up his temporal possessions to the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, would be protected against the miasma of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and would live long in good health, in his native land of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, where he would create a sufficient number of <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to preserve the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> from the rapacious hands of the Romans." Dubois desired not only that the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> should subjugate the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, but that the empire should be forced to cede to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the left bank of the Rhine, Provence, <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and all its <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> in Liguria, <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1308, after the death of the Emperor Albert I, he even thought of having the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> confer the imperial crown on the French Capets. He also devised plans for subjugating <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Thus reorganized by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> was (in the mind of Pierre Dubois) to undertake the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusade</a>; the Holy Land would be reconquered, and on the return, the Palaeologi, who reigned at Constantinople, would be replaced by the Capetian, Charles of Valois, representing the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of Catherine de Courtenay to the Latin Empire of Constantinople. The personal influence of Pierre Dubois on Philip IV must not be exaggerated. Although all his writings were presented to the king, Dubois never had an official place in Philips's council. However, there is an indisputable parallelism between his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> and certain political maneuvers of Philip IV. For instance on 9 June, 1308, Philip wrote to Henry of Carinthia, King of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, to propose Charles of Valois as a candidate for the crown of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; and on 11 June he sent three <a href="03691a.htm">knights</a> into <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> to offer money to the electors. This was fruitless labour, however, for Henry of Luxemburg was elected and <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, less subservient to the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> than certain enemies of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> have said, hastened to confirm the election.</p>

<p>Philip IV was not really a <a href="06258b.htm">free-thinker</a>; he was religious, and even made <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>: his attitude toward the inquisition is not that of a <a href="06258b.htm">free-thinker</a>, as is especially apparent in the trial of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Bernard D&eacute;licieux. The latter brought the deputies of <a href="03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a> and Albi to Philip IV at Senlis, to complain of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> inquisitors of Languedoc; the result of his action was an ordinance of Philip putting the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> inquisitors under the control of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. On the receipt of this news Languedoc became inflamed against the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>; Bernard D&eacute;licieux in 1303 headed the movement in <a href="03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a>, and when in 1304 Philip and the queen visited <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and Carcassonne, he organized tumultuous manifestations. The king was displeased, and discontinued his proceedings against the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. Then Bernard D&eacute;licieux and some of the people of <a href="03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a> conspired to deliver the town into the hands of Prince Fernand, Infant of Majorca; Philip caused sixteen of the inhabitants to be hanged, and imposed a heavy fine on the town; and this conspiracy of Bernard D&eacute;licieux against the king and the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was one of the reasons of his condemnation later in 1318 to perpetual <em>In Pace,</em> or monastic <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>.</p>

<p>Philip IV was not therefore in any way a systematic adversary of the inquisition. On the other hand, recently published documents show that he was sincerely attached to the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. From the memoirs of Rabban Cauma, ambassador of Argoun, King of the Tatars, translated from the Syriac by Abb&eacute; Chabot, we learn that Philip said to Rabban in Sept., 1287: "If the Mongolians, who are not <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, fight to capture <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, we have much more reason  to fight; if it be <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> will, we will go with an army." And the news of the fall of <a href="01110b.htm">Saint-Jean d'Acre</a> (1291), which induced so many provincial councils to express a desire for a new <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> was certainly calculated to strengthen this resolution of the king. We have referred to Dubois's <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conquest of the Holy Land; <a href="11089a.htm">Nogaret</a> was perhaps a still stronger advocate of the project; but in the plan which he outlined about 1310, the first step, according to him, was to place all the money of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in the king's hands.</p>

<p>The French Church under Philip IV displayed very little independence; it was in reality enslaved to the royal will. Almost every year it contributed to the treasury with or without the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> approval, a tenth and sometimes a fifth of its revenues; these pecuniary <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were consented to by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the provincial councils, which in return asked certain concessions or favors of the king; but Philip's fiscal agents, if they met with resistance, laid down the principle that the king could by his own authority collect from all his subjects, especially in case of necessity, whatever taxes he wished. His officers frequently harassed the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in a monstrous manner; and the documents by which Philip confirmed the <a href="07690a.htm">immunities</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> always contained subtle restrictions which enabled the king's agents to violate them.</p>

<p>A list of the <em>gravamina</em> of the Churches and the <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, discussed at the Council of Vienne (1311), contains ample <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the abuse of authority to which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was subjected, and the writer of the poem "Avisemens pour le roy Loys," composed in 1315 for Louis X, exhorted this new king to live in peace with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, which Philip IV had not done. To concentrate in his hands all the wealth of the French Church for the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, and then to endeavor to make an agreement with the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> for the control and disposition of the income of the Universal Church, was the peculiar policy of Philip IV. Recently some verses have been discovered, written by a contemporary on a leaf of register of the deliberations of Notre-Dame de Chartres, which reveal the impression produced by this policy on the minds of certain contemporaries:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jam Petri navais titubat, racio quia clavis.<br> Errat; rex, papa, facti sunt unica capa,<br> Declarant, do des Pilatus et alter Herodes.<br></p></blockquote>

<p>Philip IV, by his formal condemnation of the memory of <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, appointed himself judge of the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. It was laid down as a principle, says Geoffrey of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, that "the king is to submit to the spiritual power only if the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> is in the right <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>." The adversaries of the "theocracy" of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> hail Philip IV as its destroyer; and in their enthusiasm for him, by an extraordinary <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, they proclaim him a precursor of modern liberty. On the contrary he was an absolutist in the fullest sense of the term. The <em>Etats g&eacute;n&eacute;raux</em> of 1302, in which the Third Estate declared that the king had no superior on earth, were the precursors of the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> Gallican theories of Divine right, so favorable to the absolutism of sovereigns.</p>

<p>The civilization of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was based on a great principle, an essentially liberal principle, from which arose the political liberty of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; according to that principle, taxes before being raised by royal authority, ought to be approved by the tax-payers. <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> in the conflict of 1302 was only maintaining this principle, when he insisted on the consent of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to the collection of the <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>. In the struggle between Philip and <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a>, Philip represents absolutism, <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a> the old <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of autonomy. "The reign of Philip IV," writes Renan, "is the reign which contributed most to form the <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> of the five succeeding centuries, with its good and bad qualities. The <em>milites regis,</em> those ennobled plebeians, became the agents of all important political business; the princes of the royal blood alone remained superior to or on an equality with them; the real nobility, which elsewhere established the parliamentary governments, was excluded from participating in the public policy." Renan is right in declaring that the first act of the French magistracy was "to diminish the power of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> <em>per fas et nefas</em>" to establish the absolutism of the king; and that such conduct was for this magistracy "an <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>."</p>
