<p>(First or second century), author of the book called "The Shepherd" (<em>Poimen</em>, Pastor), a work which had great authority in ancient times and was ranked with <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> tells us that it was publicly read in the churches, and that while some denied it to be canonical, others "considered it most <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>". <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> speaks of it, together with the <a href="04779a.htm">Didache</a>, in connection with the deuterocanonical books of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, as uncanonical yet recommended by the ancients for the reading of <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. Elsewhere he calls it a most profitable book. Rufinus similarly says that the ancients wished it to be read, but not to be used as an authority as to the Faith. It is found with the Epistle of Barnabas at the end of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in the great Siniatic Bible <em>Aleph</em> (fourth century), and between the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> and the Acts of Paul in the stichometrical list of the Codex Claromontanus. In accordance with this conflicting evidence, we find two lines of opinion among the earlier Fathers. <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> and <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (in his <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> days) cite the "Shepherd" as Scripture. <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> constantly quotes it with reverence, and so does <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who held that the author was the Hermas mentioned by <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs14">Romans 16:14</a>. He says the work seems to him to be very useful, and Divinely inspired; yet he repeatedly apologizes, when he has occasion to quote it, on the ground that "many people despise it". <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, when a <a href="10521a.htm">Montanist</a>, implies that Pope St. Callistus had quoted it as an authority (though evidently not as Scripture), for he replies: "I would admit your argument, if the writing of the Shepherd had deserved to be included in the Divine Instrument, and if it were not judged by every council of the Churches, even of your own Churches, among the <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> and <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>." And again, he says that the Epistle of Barnabas is "more received among the Churches than that <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Shepherd" (<a href="../fathers/0407.htm"><em>On Pudicity</em> 10 and 20</a>). <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> was no doubt right, that the book had been excluded at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> <em>Instrumentum</em>, but he is exaggerating in referring to "every council" and to a total rejection, for the teaching of the "Pastor" was in direct contradiction with his own rigid views as to penance. His earlier use of it is paralleled by the Acts of Sts. Perpetua and Felicitas, before the end of the second century, but there is no trace of it in <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, so that it would seem to have gone out of use in Africa during the early decades of the third century. Somewhat later it is quoted by the author of the pseudo-Cyprianic tract "Adv. aleatores" as "Scriptura divina", but in <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> day it was "almost unknown to the Latins". Curiously, it went out of fashion in the East, so that the Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of it are but two in number, whereas in the West it became better known and was frequently copied in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>The book consists of five visions, twelve mandates, or commandments, and ten similitudes, or parables. It commences abruptly in the first <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>: "He who brought me up sold me to a certain Rhoda, who was at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After many years I met her again, and began to <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> her as a sister." As Hermas was on the road to Cumae, he had a vision of Rhoda, who was presumably dead. She told him that she was his accuser in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, on account of an unchaste thought he had once had concerning her, though only in passing; he was to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> for forgiveness for himself and all his house. He is consoled by a vision of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the form of an aged <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>, weak and helpless from the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who tells him to do penance and to correct the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> of his children. Subsequently he sees her made younger through penance, yet wrinkled and with white hair; then again, as quite young but still with white hair &#151; this is the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the forgiven. Lastly, she shows herself all glorious as a Bride &#151; this is the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the end of the days. In the second vision she gives Hermas a book, which she afterwards takes back in order to add to it. He is to give this writing to the <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, who will read it to the people; another copy is for "Grapte", who will communicate it to the <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a>; and a third is to be sent by Clement to the foreign Churches, "for this is his office". We see here the constitution of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>: the <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a> set over different <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>; Grapte (no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> a <a href="04651a.htm">deaconess</a>) who is connected with the <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a>; Clement, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who is the organ of communication between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the rest of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the second century is well known to us from other sources. The fifth vision, which is represented as taking place twenty days after the fourth, introduces "the Angel of repentance" in the guise of a shepherd, from whom the whole work takes its name. He delivers to Hermas a series of <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> (<em>mandata</em>, <em>entolai</em>) as to the <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in one <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, simplicity, truthfulness, chastity, long-suffering, <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, fear, continence, confidence, <a href="07131b.htm">cheerfulness</a>, <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>, good desires. These form an interesting development of early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> ethics. The only point which needs special mention is the assertion of a husband's <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to take back an adulterous wife on her repentance. The eleventh mandate, on <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>, is concerned with <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a> who desire to occupy the first seats (that is to say, among the <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a>). It is possible that we have here a reference to <a href="09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, who came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> about 142-4 and desired to be admitted among the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> (or possibly even to become <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>). After the mandata come ten similitudes (<em>parabolai</em>) in the form of visions, which are explained by the <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a>. The longest of these (ix) is an elaboration of the <a href="11460a.htm">parable</a> of the building of a tower, which had formed the matter of the third vision. The tower is the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the stones of which it is built are the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. But in Vis. iii it looked as though only the holy are a part of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; in Sim. ix it is clearly pointed out that all the <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> are included, though they may be cast out for grave <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, and can be readmitted only after penance.</p>

<p>The whole book is thus concerned with the <a href="15472a.htm">Christian virtues</a> and their exercise. It is an <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a>, not a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, work. The intention is above all to preach repentance. A single chance of restoration after fall is given to <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and this opportunity is spoken of as something new, which had never been clearly published before. The writer is pained by the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> of the faithful and is sincerely anxious for their conversion and return to <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>. As a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>, Hermas avoids <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, and, when incidentally it comes in, it is vague or incorrect. It has been thought with some reason that he did not distinguish the Son from the Holy Ghost, or that he held that the Holy Ghost became the Son by His Incarnation. But his words are not clear, and his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> on the subject may have been rather misty and confused than definitely <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Authorship and date</h2>

<p>It is not easy to decide whether the writer has given us a genuine fragment of autobiography and a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> account of visions which he saw or imagined that he saw, or whether the entire work is fictitious both in form and in setting. Three dates are suggested by the variety of evidence available. The reference to St. Clement as <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> would give the date 89-99 for at least the first two visions. On the other hand, if the writer is identified with the Hermas mentioned by <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, an earlier date becomes probable, unless he wrote as a very old man. But three ancient witnesses, one of whom claims to be contemporary, declare that he was the brother of <a href="12126b.htm">Pope St. Pius I</a>, who was not earlier than 140-55. These three are (a) the <a href="10642a.htm">Muratorian fragment</a>; (b) the Liberian catalogue of <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, in a portion which dates from 235 (<a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>?); (c) the poem of Pseudo-Tertullian against <a href="09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, of the third or fourth century. (a) "Pastorem uero nuperrime temporibus nostris in urbe Roma Herma conscripsit, sedente cathedra urbis Romae ecclesiae Pio episcopo fratre ejus. Et ideo legi eum quidem oportet, se publicare uero in ecclesia populo neque inter prophetas completos numero, neque inter apostolos in fine temporum, potest" &#151; "And very recently, in our own times, in the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Herma wrote the Pastor, when his brother <a href="12126b.htm">Pius</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, sat upon the chair of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. And therefore that [book] ought to be perused, but it cannot be publicly read to the people assembled in church, neither among the Prophets, whose number is complete, nor among the Apostles [who came] in the end of times." (b) "Sub hujus [Pii] episcopatu frater ejus Ermes librum scripsit, in quo mandatum continetur quae [quod] praecepit ei angelus, cum venit ad illum in habitu Pastoris" &#151; "Under his [<a href="12126b.htm">Pius's</a>] episcopate, his brother Ermes wrote a book in which are contained the <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> which the <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> delivered to him, coming to him in the guise of a Shepherd." (c) "Post hunc deinde Pius, Hermas cui germine frater angelicus Pastor, quia tradita verba locutus." &#151; "Then, after him, <a href="12126b.htm">Pius</a>, whose brother according to the flesh was Hermas, the angelic shepherd, because he spoke the words given to him." The three authorities are probably citing the same <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> catalogue (of Hegesippus?). As (c) quotes some details from this list which are absent from (b), it would seem that he is independent of (b). (a) has added the inference that the "Pastor" may be read publicly, provided it be not numbered among the fourteen <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a>, nor among the Apostolic writings. The statement that Hermas wrote during his brother's pontificate may similarly be an inference from the fact that it was in a list of <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, against the name of <a href="12126b.htm">Pius</a>, that the writer found the information that Hermas was that <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> brother. He may have been an elder brother of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who was probably an old man in 140. Hence it is quite possible that Hermas might have been past thirty when Clement died, at the time of his first and second visions. But because this is possible, it does not follow that it is very probable.</p>

<p>Older critics unanimously attributed the authorship to the Hermas of Rom., xvi, 14 &#151; <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, Cave, <a href="09151b.htm">Le Nourry</a>, <a href="03476b.htm">R&eacute;mi Ceillier</a>, Lardner, etc., with <a href="02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, who strangely thought the same Hermas might have been brother to <a href="12126b.htm">Pius I</a>. In the middle of the eighteenth century Mosheim and Schroeck preferred the testimony of the Muratorian Canon, which was published in 1740; but <a href="06349c.htm">Gallandi</a> and <a href="09431b.htm">Lumper</a> adhered to the earlier view. Zahn, in an early work (1868), stood by the references to St. Clement and imagined a Hermas, neither known to <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> nor brother to <a href="12126b.htm">St. Pius</a>, but writing in the last decade of the first century. He was followed by Peters and Caspari. But Hefele had been teaching that we cannot refuse the contemporary witness of the <a href="10642a.htm">Muratorian Fragment</a>, and this view has in the end prevailed amongst scholars, being now almost universally received. The question remains how we are to explain the mention of St. Clement. It was suggested above that Hermas may have been older than his brother <a href="12126b.htm">Pius</a>. But Harnack, holding that monepiscopacy was unknown in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> until Anicetus, the successor of <a href="12126b.htm">Pius</a>, has no difficulty in holding that Clement really lived into the beginning of the second century, and that <a href="12126b.htm">Pius</a> was the most prominent among the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> even before 140. He therefore dates part of Visio ii, the kernel of the whole, before 110, and the final redaction not earlier than 135, nor later than 145. It is indeed <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that the book itself describes the various parts as having been written down successively, and the process may well have taken three or four years, but hardly a decade or two. Perhaps the most probable view is that the historical data in the book are fictitious; the author was really the brother of <a href="12126b.htm">Pope Pius</a>, and wrote during his brother's pontificate. The evils of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in his day which he describes are not impossible in the first century, but they certainly suit the second better. There is a possible reference to <a href="09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> visit to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> about 142, and there is a probable reference to <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> theories in Simil. viii, ix. The writer wished to be thought to belong to the preceding generation &#151; hence the name of Clement, the most famous of earlier <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, instead of the name <a href="12126b.htm">Pius</a>. We cannot even be sure that the writer's name was really Hermas. It is a suitable name for a slave, being a shortened form of <em>Hermogenes, Hermodorous</em>, or some such word. Dr. Rendel Harris has urged in an interesting essay that where Hermas describes twelve mountains in Arcadia (Simil. ix, 1), the description of the locality is taken from Pausanias. Dr. Armitage Robinson thought that we must even suppose that Hermas <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> the place himself, and had been brought up in Arcadia. But all this is inconclusive, though plausible. The notion of De Champagny (who was followed by <a href="07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a>), that the "Shepherd" is made up of two works, the one (Vis. i-iv) by the disciple of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the remainder by the brother of <a href="12126b.htm">Pope Pius</a>, is sufficiently refuted by the unity of style and matter, as Baumgaertner has shown. The same is to be said of Hilgenfeld's opinion, that we have before us a fusion of works by three authors. Spitta has brought into patristic study the method he has applied to the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> and the Apocalypse, and he finds in Hermas traces of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> enlargement of a Jewish writing, as Voelter had said of the Apocalypse. It is natural that Voelter should have approved this theory, but Spitta has not been followed by patristic scholars. Haussleiter formerly attributed only Vis. v-Simil. x to the brother of <a href="12126b.htm">Pius</a>, regarding Vis. i-iv as an addition made at the end of the second century in order to recommend the book as the work of Hermas, disciple of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. But that personage is not even mentioned.</p>

<p>There is but one direct quotation in the "Shepherd", and that is from the <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> book of "Eldad and Modat, who prophesied to the people in the wilderness", and the reference is apparently ironical. But there are many indirect citations from the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. According to Swete, Hermas never cites the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, but he uses a version of Daniel akin to that of Theodotion. He shows acquaintance with one or other of the Synoptic Gospels, and, since he also uses that of St. John, he probably <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> all three. He appears to employ Ephesians and other Epistles, including perhaps I Peter and Hebrews. But the books he most certainly and most often uses are the Epistle of St. James and the Apocalypse. His matter is rather dull to us moderns, and the simplicity of his manner has been characterized as childish. But the admiration of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> was not given to a work without depth or value; and, even with regard to the style, Westcott has reason to say ("On the Canon", pt. I, ch. ii): "The beauty of the language and conception in many parts has never been sufficiently appreciated. Much of it may be compared with the 'Pilgrim's Progress' and higher praise than this cannot be given to a book of its kind." There is indeed some resemblance between the intensity and directness of the ancient <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> and that of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="12581a.htm">Puritan</a>, however antipodean the antithesis between the <a href="07761a.htm">individualism</a> of the one and the conception of a Universal Church which dominate the whole thought of the other.</p>

<p>The "Shepherd" was first printed in Latin by <a href="09114b.htm">Faber Stapulensis (Lef&egrave;vre d'Etaples)</a> in "Liber trium virorum et trium spiritualium virginum" (Paris, 1513); better edition by Fell (Oxford, 1685), and especially by Hilgenfeld (Leipzig, 1873), and von Gebhardt (Leipzig, 1877). This version, which is contained in many <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and has been frequently reprinted in the editions of the <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>, is known as the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. It was certainly known to the author of the "Adversus aleatores" (third or fourth cent.), and possibly to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, and the translation was probably made in the second century. Another version is contained in a single <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Vat. Palat. 150, saec. xiv), and has been printed by Dressel, "Patres Apost." (Leipzig, 1857 and 1863), and von Gebhardt and Harnack ("Patres Apost.", Leipzig, 1877). It is of the fifth century, according to Harnack, and the translator has used the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> version as an aid. Haussleiter's attempt to show that the Palatine is the older is rejected by Harnack and Funk. An <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> version was discovered in 1847 by <a href="01006e.htm">d'Abbadie</a>; it has unfortunately a few lacunae and accidental omissions. It seems to have been made in the year 543. The Greek original was first known from a fourteenth-century <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> on <a href="02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a>. The well-known <a href="06135b.htm">forger</a> Simonides stole four of the leaves and copied the rest. But he sold to the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="09140a.htm">University of Leipzig</a> a Greek version which he had composed himself. This was published in 1856 by Rudolf Anger, with preface and index by Dindorf. The <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a> was soon discovered. The four leaves and Simonides' copy were procured by the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>, and the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> readings were published by Anger in the "Leipziger Repertorium der deutschen und auslaendischen Literatur", III (1856), 138. Since then the six leaves which remain on <a href="02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> have been collated by J. Armitage Robinson. The <a href="04085a.htm">Codex Sinaiticus</a> discovered by Tischendorf and published by him in 1862, contains the "Pastor", but in both <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> the end is wanting. Two fragments of the book are found on a papyrus leaf from the Fayoum, now at <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>.</p>
