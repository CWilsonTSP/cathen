<p>American statesman, b. at Annapolis, <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 19 September 1737, d. at Doughoregan manor near <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 14 November, 1832.</p>

<p>His grandfather, Charles Carroll, <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> because of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 1 October 1688. He obtained considerable grants of land and was made attorney-general under the third Lord Baltimore. The year he arrived in America, Lord Baltimore was deprived of his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, and <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> was made a royal province. As Carroll was in favour with the Baltimores, he enjoyed important political positions in the colony before and after the restoration of their <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> in 1715. Charles Carroll of Annapolis, the father of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, was born in 1703, and died in 1783. He was a wealthy landowner and bitterly opposed the political disabilities under which the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> suffered. The mother of Charles Carroll of Carrollton was Elizabeth Brooke, the daughter of Clement Brooke and Jane Sewall, and was a near relation of her husband. Charles Carroll's biographer, Rowland, divides his life into three periods of about thirty years each; the first was a period of preparation, the second a period of public service, and the third a period of retirement, with scholarly observation of public events. At ten years of age Carles Carroll was sent to <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> on Harmon's Manor in <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, where one of his fellow students was his cousin, John Carroll, afterwards <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. The following year, 1748, they both crossed the ocean to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at St-Omer in French <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, where Charles remained six years. After a year at the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> he entered the College Louis le Grand at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1753 Carroll went to Bourges to study <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>. He remained there for a year and then returned to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> until 1757. In this year he took apartments in the Temple, London, where he studied <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> for several years. In later days he spoke in highest praise of the training he received at St-Omer and the College Louis le Grand. To the former he owed his deep conviction of religious <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to the latter his critical ability, his literary style, and the basis for the breadth of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which made him an invaluable citizen.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Upon his return to America, in 1765, the estate of Carrollton in Frederick County, <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, was given him and later he became known as Charles Carroll of Carrollton, to distinguish him from his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> Charles Carroll of Annapolis. In the difficulties with the mother country, Carroll aggressively defended the position taken by the colonies. In 1770, by a proclamation Governor Eden imposed certain fees upon the colonists. As fees were treated as taxes this was vigorously opposed as violating the right of the people to tax themselves. The jurist Daniel Dulaney defended the position of the Government in a series of articles in the "Maryland Gazette" under the signature Antillon. Carroll took up the debate as a champion of popular <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, maintaining the thesis that fees were taxes and that taxes should not be levied upon the people except by the consent of their representatives. He wrote four articles and the popular sentiment was decidedly with him. This controversy established Carroll's reputation as a debater and a scholar.</p>

<p>In 1774, Carroll was elected with six others by the citizens of Anne Arundel County and of Annapolis, with full power to represent them in the provincial convention. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had been disfranchised and declared ineligible to a seat in the Assembly, but by this act the prejudice against them was swept away. Carroll was from this time for a period of twenty-seven years called to important public service in behalf of the colony and for the general government. In December of this year he was appointed a member of a Provincial Committee of Correspondence. He was a member of the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Convention of 1775 which adopted the "Association of the Freemen of <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>" which became the charter of the colony until the adoption of the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> constitution in 1776. The Association was pledged to an armed resistance to Great Britain. He was appointed by the convention one of a committee of nine to "consider the ways and means to put this province in the best state of defense". On 12 September, 1775, the citizens of Anne Arundel County and the city of Annapolis appointed a Committee of Observation for the town and county of which Carroll was a member. At this meeting he was elected one of the deputies to represent the county in the State Convention for one year, and he was selected with six others to license suits in the county for the same period. The Colonial Convention on the 13th of October appointed Charles Carroll chairman of a committee of five "to devise ways and means to promote the manufacture of saltpetre". On the 11th of January 1776, he <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Convention instructed the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> delegates to the Continental Congress, "to disavow in the most solemn manner, all design in the colonies for independence". This position was strenuously opposed by Carroll, who at this time advocated independence. In February, 1776, the Continental congress appointed Carroll one of a committee of three to visit <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> to secure the alliance of the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadians</a> in the struggle for independence. Franklin and Samuel Chase were the other members of the committee, and Father John, afterwards <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, Carroll accompanied them. The committee was clothed with almost absolute power over military affairs in that country, and their failure to accomplish their object was not due either to their want of <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> or lack of ability. On the 28th of June, 1776, the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Convention withdrew the instructions given on previous occasions to its delegates to Congress, and authorized them "to vote in declaring the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> free and independent states". Principally responsible for this change of attitude by <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> was Charles Carroll, who was afterwards rewarded in being elected a delegate to the Continental Congress on the 4th of July. He took his seat on the 18th of July and signed the Declaration of Independence on the 2nd of August, when the copy engrossed on parchment was presented for signature. Of all the signers he risked the most. He was the wealthiest man in the colonies at the beginning of the Revolution, his wealth being estimated at $2,000,000. On the 19th of July Carroll was appointed on the Board of War, a very important appointment, as this board had charge of all the executive <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the military department, subject to the direction of Congress. In the fall of 1777 the Board of War was enlarged and some of Washington" enemies were made members. Out of this new membership the Conway Cabal developed, the objects of which were defeated by Carroll, Morris, and Duer.</p>

<p>Charles Carroll was appointed one of two delegates from Annapolis to the Colonial Convention which was to adopt a constitution for <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. It met 14 August. Carroll was selected as one of the seven to draw up a constitution. He was responsible for the distinctive part of the constitution, the method of choosing senators. The senate was to be composed of fifteen members, who were to be selected by a body of forty electors, two from each county, and one each from <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and Annapolis. In the fall of 1778, Carroll resigned his seat in Congress and returned to <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> to become a member of its senate. He was placed on all its important committees. He was re-elected to Congress in 1780, but promptly resigned from his seat. He was elected president of the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Senate, 23 May, 1783, and a second time on 23 December. Carroll was in the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Senate from 1787 to 1789, when the constitution was adopted, and became a leader of the Federalists. He was elected to the U. S. Senate from <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and took his seat in 1789. On the 19th of May, Carroll was appointed one of a committee of three to revise the journal of the Senate for publication. As a Federalist Carroll favoured the tariff, Hamilton's funding measures, and the strengthening of the national government. He and Lee of Virginia were the chief advocates of placing the capital at Philadelphia for ten years, thence to be removed to the Potomac. As a democrat he opposed all distinctions and titles. Although favouring a centralized government he preferred to serve his state, for when Congress at its session in 1792 passed a law making it ineligible for a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> to hold office in Congress and in a State legislature, Carroll resigned his seat in the U.S. Senate to retain his place in the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> Senate. In this capacity he served the <a href="09755b.htm">State of Maryland</a> till 1801. In 1799 he served on the committee to settle the boundary disputes between <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and Virginia.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>After the election of Jefferson to the presidency in 1800, Carroll viewed public events with anxiety and fear. He was out of sympathy with the prosecution of a second <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with Great Britain. In later years he became more hopeful of his nation's future. His last public act was the laying of the <a href="14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the Baltimore and <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a> railroad on the 4th of July, 1828. After the death of Adams and Jefferson on the 4th of July, 1826, he was the only surviving Signer of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June, 1768, Charles Carroll married his cousin Mary Darnall, who died in 1782. They had seven children, four of whom died in youth. One of his daughters married Richard Caton, an Englishman, and another married the distinguished statesman from <a href="14157a.htm">South Carolina</a>, Robert Goodloe Harper. He outlived by several years his only son, Charles Carroll, Jr.</p>
