<p>If we call a retreat a series of days passed in solitude and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to practices of asceticism, in particular to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance, it is as old as <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Without referring to the customs of the Prophets of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the forty days which <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> passed in the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> after His <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> is an example which has found many imitators in all ages of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. From this imitation sprang the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life and the institution of the cenobites. The religious who sought the solitude of the <a href="04749a.htm">deserts</a> or the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, or in general those wishing to lead a contemplative life withdrew from the world, in order the more readily to draw nearer to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and apply themselves to exercises of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>. The "Forma cleri" of Tronson, t. IV, gives numerous texts of the Fathers and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, recommending a retreat for at least a few days. According to <a href="06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> (Treatise on the Love of God, XII, chap. vii), the practice of the retreat was specially restored by <a href="07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>. We may say indeed that in his "Spiritual Exercises" St. Ignatius has combined the methods of reforming one's life and seeking the will of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in solitude. The <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was the first active <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order in which the practice of the retreat became <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by rule. <a href="06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> and his first companions occasionally retired to hermitages where they gave themselves up to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a>. St. Ignatius prescribed for his religious the exercises of thirty days as an indispensable experience before admission to the <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>. The custom was introduced later of repeating this thirty days' retreat during a month of the third probation, and the usage was established little by little of renewing it in an abridged form each year during eight days. This custom obtained the force of law by <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Sixth General Congregation, held in 1608, besides being imitated in other <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and encouraged by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>, 1606.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> did not reserve these exercises for its own exclusive use, but gave them to communities and <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>. Blessed Peter Faber in his "Memoriale" testifies to having given them to the grandees of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and used them in restoring hundreds of <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> to their first fervour. A letter of St. Ignatius (3 Feb., 1554) recommends giving the exercises publicly in the churches. In addition, the houses of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> often contained rooms for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> desirous of performing the exercises privately. Ignatius, having sanctioned this custom during his lifetime, one of his successors, Aquaviva, exhorted the <a href="12514b.htm">provincials</a> to its maintenance in 1599. In studying the spread of this practice we must not neglect the influence of <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> co-operated in order to promote this sort of apostolate. A fervent admirer and disciple of the "Spiritual Exercises", <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles</a> introduced them as a regular practice among the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> by retreats for seminarians and candidates for <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>. He built at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> an <em>asceterium,</em> or house solely destined to receive those making retreats, whose direction he confided to the Oblates. The <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles</a> was effectual in encouraging the sons of St. Ignatius to adopt definitively the annual retreat, and to organize outside collective retreats of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>.</p>

<p>Two other <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> furthered the practice. St. Francis de Sales, whose veneration for the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and his works is well known, made the retreat, praised it, and made it familiar to the Order of the Visitation, of which he was the founder (Const. XLVI). Then came <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, chosen by St. Francis de Sales to be the spiritual father of the Visitation in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was the organizer of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> retreats in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the plan of which had been already proposed in 1625, at the assembly of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, by a <em>cur&eacute;</em> of Normandy, Charles Dodefroy, in a small work, entitled "Le coll&egrave;ge des <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> exercises". <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> established retreats for candidates for <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> first at <a href="02377c.htm">Beauvais</a> (1628), afterwards at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1631). They took place six times a year under his direction at the Coll&egrave;ge des Bons-Enfants. Soon other <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> than those of the Diocese of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> were admitted; and when Saint-Lazare had been acquired (1634) this house was opened indiscriminately as a retreat for <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, nobility, and people. In St. Vincent's time about 20,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> made retreats there. M. de B&eacute;rulle founder of the Oratory, and <a href="11240d.htm">M. Olier</a>, founder of Saint-Sulpice, seconded this movement of reform and sanctification. From the middle of the seventeenth century, the synodal <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> prescribed that the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> should make a retreat from time to time. Sometimes it was made <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> for those who obtained <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> with the <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>. In a word, the retreat was thenceforth an established custom of <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. In 1663 M. de Kerlivio, who <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> the excellent results obtained at Saint-Lazare, founded a house of retreat for men at <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a> in Brittany, with the co-operation of P. Huby, S.J. This institution has a special importance in the history of retreats, because the regulations of <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a> generally guided the directors of other houses which the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established. These were at <a href="12611a.htm">Quimper</a>, <a href="12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, Paris, <a href="04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, <a href="10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, and soon in most of the large cities of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Often, besides the house of retreat for men, one would be erected for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>: as at <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, thanks to the Venerable Catherine de Francheville, at <a href="12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, at <a href="12611a.htm">Quimper</a>, at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, etc. With a view to organizing and facilitating retreats for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, there were formed, particularly in Brittany, congregations of Ladies of the Retreat which are still in existence.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>France was not alone in having houses of exercises, They were established in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> and Prague; in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, at Barcelona and Gerona; in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>; in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, at <a href="11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, Alcamo, Mazzara, Termini, <a href="10216a.htm">Messina</a>, etc.; in <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, at <a href="15432a.htm">Vilna</a>; in Mexico, at <a href="10269a.htm">Mexico City</a> and Pueblo. The enumeration is necessarily incomplete; it should include missionary countries, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="03660a.htm">Chile</a>, <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, etc. Nor were <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> the only ones to busy themselves with retreats: <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="05596b.htm">Eudists</a>, <a href="11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>, <a href="11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, and others vied with them in <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. But the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a> struck a fatal blow at the work in many a country. In Brittany, the classic land of retreats, various religious, and principally <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, continued this ministry of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In Franche-Comt&eacute; a saintly <em>cur&eacute;,</em> the Venerable Antoine* Receveur, organized the <a href="03721a.htm">Congregation of Christian Retreat</a> to secure for men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> the benefits of spiritual exercises. In <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the Venerable Bruno Lanteri instituted a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Oblates of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who were occupied only with retreats. <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>, who from his youth had followed the exercises among the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> or among the <a href="10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, could not neglect this means of apostleship. He adopted it as one of his own practices and prescribed it for the <a href="12683a.htm">Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer</a>. Thus the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> kept up the custom of retreats in the Kingdoms of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> during the second half of the eighteenth century. In <a href="01702d.htm">Argentina</a> and Paraguay the retreats continued, thanks to the extraordinary initiative given by Maria-Antonia de San Jos&eacute; de La Paz (1730-1799). Aided by several <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and various <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, she succeeded in having the exercises performed by nearly 100,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<p>Annual <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> retreats began as a general thing in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and other countries in 1815. Numerous promoters of these retreats came from the ranks of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> as well as from the regular orders. A large number of directors are annually engaged in giving retreats to the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. Several institutions perform the complete exercises of twenty to thirty days. But there were not only <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> or conventual retreats; they were made by the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, grouped in <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> or in congregations, brotherhoods, third orders, etc. Thus retreats are conducted for employees, working-men, teachers, conscripts, deaf-mutes, etc. We may also mention retreats at the close of a course of study, established in the College of St. Acheul at <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a> in 1825, and which, spreading by degrees, led to the organization of retreats among the <em>alumni,</em> a custom that has become quite general. There has been no lack of co-operation in this great work of regeneration: <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> threw open their <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> to the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> nobility lent their ch&acirc;teaux; the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders &mdash; <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="10357a.htm">Lazaristes</a>, <a href="05596b.htm">Eudists</a>, <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, the <a href="09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>, Brothers of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and <a href="08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, all encouraged the retreat, either by providing suitable places for the purpose, or by furnishing directors. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> alone possessed twelve houses of exercises on French territory before 1901; they now have seven in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and others in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="04121b.htm">Colombia</a>, <a href="03660a.htm">Chile</a>, and various other countries of America, North and South. They have established houses in <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a>, <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>, <a href="03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, and Madagascar. Besides the Breton congregations already spoken of, new <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> especially devoted to retreats for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> have been formed, such as Notre Dame du Cenacle, and Marie Reparatrice.</p>

<p>Retreats for <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> have spread greatly throughout the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world during the last twenty-five years. A <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, P&egrave;re Henry, was the pioneer in this great revival. In 1882 he gave himself to the task of instituting retreats for working-men, and it was not long before houses devoted to this purpose were founded all over <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. During 1908, in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> alone 243 retreats were given, attended by 10,253 exercitants, and since 1890 in that country at least 100,000 of the labouring classes and about 25,000 professional and business men have made retreats. <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> and other <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> States have also extended the work with gratifying results. In one house in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, Notre Dame du Haut-Mont, more than 30,500 men have made the retreat within the last twenty-five years. <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> have taken up the movement, and are at present engaged with retreat organizations, as also is <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> a generous response has been given to the movement, and a house of retreat has been founded (1911) on Staten Island, New York City.</p>

<p>The principal reason of the success of these retreats, called <a href="04060a.htm">cloistered</a> to distinguish them from the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> retreats open to all, is their very necessity. In the fever and agitation of modern life, the need of meditation and spiritual repose impresses itself on <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> who desire to reflect on their eternal destiny, and direct their life in this world towards <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
