<p>(Latin <em>Matrimonia mixta</em>).</p>

<p>Technically, mixed marriages are those between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics, when the latter have been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in some <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. The term is also frequently employed to designate unions between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and infidels. From the very beginning of its existence the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ has been opposed to such unions. As Christ raised wedlock to the dignity of a Sacrament, a marriage between a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a non-Catholic was rightly looked upon as degrading the holy character of matrimony, involving as it did a communion in sacred things with those outside the fold. The <a href="11567b.htm">Apostle St. Paul</a> insists strongly on <a href="09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a> being a symbol of the union between Christ and His <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and hence sacred. The very intimacy of the union necessarily established between those joined in wedlock requires a concordance above all in their religious sentiments. Holding this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, it was but natural and <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to do all in her power to hinder her children from contracting marriage with those outside her pale, who did not recognize the <a href="03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> of the union on which they were entering (see Marriage). Hence arose the impediments to a marriage with a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> (<em>mixta religio</em>) and with an infidel (<em>disparitas cultus</em>). As regards marriage with an infidel, the early Church did not consider such unions invalid, especially when a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> had been converted to the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> after such marriage. It was hoped that the converted wife or husband would be the means of bringing the other party to the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, or at least safeguarding the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> upbringing of the children of the union. This held even for <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, though the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was naturally more opposed to wedlock between them and <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, even than with <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>, owing to the intense Jewish <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the sacred name of Christ. By degrees, however, the objection to a marriage between a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and an infidel grew stronger as the necessity for such unions decreased, and so in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, more by custom than by positive enactment, the impediment of <em>disparitas cultus</em> making such marriages null and void began to have force. When the <em>Decretum</em> of Gratian was published in the twelfth century, this impediment was recognized as a diriment one and it became part of the canon law of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. (Decretum Grat., c. 28, q. 1.) From that time forward, all marriages contracted between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and infidels were held to be invalid unless a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> for such union had been obtained from the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. Marriages, however, between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> were not subject to the same impediment. They were held as valid, though illicit if a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> <em>mixt&aelig; religionis</em> had not been obtained. The opposition of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to such unions is, however very ancient, and early councils, legislated against marriages of this character. Such enactments are found in the fourth century Councils of Elvira (can. 16) and of <a href="08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (can. 10, 31.). The General <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (can. 14) prohibits such unions especially between members of the lower <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> grades and <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. While the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a> forbade these <a href="09707a.htm">marriages</a>, it did not declare them invalid. In the <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, however, the seventh century <a href="04311b.htm">Council in Trullo</a>, declared marriages between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> null and devoid (can. 72), and this discipline has since been maintained in the Greek Schismatical Church. The latter has also shown itself opposed to marriages between members of the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> various <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> were passed ordering that such marriages be not permitted unless the children of the union are to be brought up as schismatics.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The advent of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in the sixteenth century renewed the problem of mixed marriages in a heightened degree. The danger of perversion for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party or for the children, and the almost certain unhappiness awaiting the members of such unions caused more stringent legislation on the part of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This was emphasized by the impediment of <a href="04001a.htm">clandestinity</a> enacted by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. We say enacted by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, because from the twelfth century the validity of <a href="04001a.htm">clandestine marriages</a> had been recognized by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This was not, however, the original discipline, for it had anciently been looked on as proper for <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> to contract marriages only <em>in facie Ecclesiae</em> (<a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0407.htm"><em>On Pudicity</em> 4</a>). Marriages contracted otherwise were held as null and void by various decrees of the Roman Emperors of the East and capitularies of French Kings, and the same is evident from the <a href="05773a.htm">False Decretals</a>. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> therefore in declaring all matrimonial unions between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics null and void, unless entered into before the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, was rather inaugurating a return to the old discipline existent before the twelfth century than making an entirely new law. By its <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> the Council requires the contract to be entered into before the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or some other <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> delegated by him, and in the presence of two or three witnesses under penalty of invalidity. Marriages otherwise contracted are called <a href="04001a.htm">clandestine marriages</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> did not find it possible, however, to insist on the rigour of this <a href="09053a.htm">legislation</a> in all countries owing to strong <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> opposition. Indeed, in many countries, it was not found advisable to <a href="12454b.htm">promulgate</a> the decrees of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> at all, and in such countries the impediment of <a href="04001a.htm">clandestinity</a> did not obtain. Even in countries where the <em>Tametsi</em> (q.v.) <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> had been published, serious difficulties arose. As a consequence <a href="02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a>, choosing the lesser of two evils, issued a declaration concerning marriages in <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (Nov. 4, 1741), in which he declared mixed unions to be valid, provided they were according to the civil <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> even if the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> prescriptions had not been observed. A similar declaration was made concerning mixed marriages in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> by <a href="12131a.htm">Pope Pius</a>, in 1785, and gradually the "Benedictine <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>" was extended to various localities. The object of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in issuing its <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> had been partly to deter <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from such marriages altogether, and partly to hinder any communion in sacred things with <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. By degrees, however, the Popes felt constrained to make various concessions for mixed marriages, though they were always careful to guard the essential principles on which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> found her objections to such unions. Thus <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> allowed mixed marriages in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> to take place in the presence of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, provided no religious solemnity was employed, and with the omission of public <a href="02255a.htm">banns</a>, as evidence of the unwillingness of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to sanction such unions. Similar concessions were later made, first for various states of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and then for other countries.</p>

<p>Another serious difficulty arose for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> where the civil <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> prescribed that in mixed marriages the boys born of the union should follow the religion of the father and the girls that of the mother. Without betraying their sacred trust, the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> could never sanction such legislation, but in order to avoid greater evils they permitted in some states of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> a passive assistance on the part of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at marriages entered into under such conditions. As to a mixed marriage contracted before a non-Catholic minister, <a href="12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> issued an instruction, 17 Feb., 1864. He declared that in places where the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> preacher occupied the position of a civil magistrate and the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the country required marriages to be entered into before him in order that certain legal effects may follow, it is permitted to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party to appear before him either before or after the marriage has taken place in presence of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. If, however, the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> minister is held to be discharging a religious <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> in such witnessing of a marriage, then it is unlawful for a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to renew consent before him as this would be a communion in sacred things and an implicit yielding to <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Parish <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are also reminded that it is their strict <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to tell <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who ask for information that such going before a minister in a religious capacity is unlawful and that they thereby subject themselves to <a href="03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censure</a>. Where, however, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> is not asked, and he has reason to fear that his admonitions will prove unavailing, he may keep his peace provided there be no <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> and the other conditions required by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> be fulfilled. When a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party has gone before an <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> minister before coming to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, the latter cannot be present at the marriage until full reparation has been made. For the issuing of a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> for a mixed marriage, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> requires three conditions; that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party be allowed free exercise of religion, that all the offspring are to be brought up <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party promise to do all that is possible to convert the non-Catholic. It is not to be supposed, however, that even when these precautions have been taken, this is all the suffices for the issuance of a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. In an instruction to the Bishops of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, 25 March 1869, the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a> declared that the above conditions are exacted by the natural and <a href="09071a.htm">divine law</a> to remove the intrinsic dangers in mixed marriages, but that in addition there must be some grave necessity, which cannot otherwise be avoided, for allowing the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> to expose themselves to the grave dangers inherent in these unions, even when the prescribed conditions have been fulfilled. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are therefore to warn <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> against such marriages and not to grant <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> for them except for weighty reasons and not at the mere will of the petitioner. The latest legislation affecting mixed marriages is that of the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> Ne temere which went into effect 18 April, 1908. By this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> all marriages everywhere in the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics are invalid unless they take place in the presence of an accredited <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and two witnesses, and this even in countries where the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> law was not binding. By a later <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, Provida, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> exempted <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> from the new legislation. (See <a href="04001a.htm">CLANDESTINITY</a>; <a href="05037b.htm">DISPARITY OF WORSHIP</a>; <a href="05041a.htm">DISPENSATION</a>; <a href="09707a.htm">SACRAMENT OF MARRIAGE</a>).</p>

<h2>Appendix: later decisions of the Holy Office</h2>

<p>Since the article on this subject was written, the following decisions have been issued by the Congregation of the Holy Office, 21 June, 1913. The <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the impediment of disparity is never to be granted except with all the explicit guarantees or safeguards.

The prescription of the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Ne Temere" on the asking and receiving by the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest, for the validity of marriage, of the consent of the parties, in mixed marriages in which due guarantees are obstinately refused by them, henceforth does not apply, but strict observance is to be paid to preceding concessions and instructions of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> on the subject, especially of <a href="07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>, Apostolical Letter, 30 April, 1841, to the Bishops of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>.</p>
