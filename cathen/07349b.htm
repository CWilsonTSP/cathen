<p>Bishop, born in that city at the beginning of the fourth century; died there 1 November, according to the most accredited opinion, or according to the <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, on 13 January, 368. Belonging to a noble and very probably <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, he was instructed in all the branches of profane learning, but, having also taken up the study of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> and finding there the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> which he sought so ardently, he renounced <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Thenceforth his wide learning and his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the Faith attracted such attention that he was chosen about 350 to govern the body of the faithful which the city had possessed since the third century. We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who governed this <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> in the beginning. Hilary is the first concerning whom we have authentic information, and this is due to the important part he played in opposing <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was then greatly disturbed by internal discords, the authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> not being so powerful in practice as either to prevent or to stop them. <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a> had made frightful ravages in various regions and threatened to invade Gaul, where it already had numerous partisans more or less secretly affiliated with it. Saturninus, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles, the most active of the latter, being exposed by Hilary, convened and presided over a council at B&eacute;ziers in 356 with the intention of justifying himself, or rather of establishing his <a href="07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>. Here the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> <a href="06147a.htm">courageously</a> presented himself to defend <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, but the council, composed for the most part of <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>, refused to hear him, and being shortly afterwards denounced to the Emperor Constantius, the protector of <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, he was at his command transported to the distant coasts of Phrygia.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> could not subdue the valiant champion. Instead of remaining inactive during his exile he gave himself up to study, completed certain of his works which he had begun, and wrote his treatise on the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>. In this work he analysed the professions of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> uttered by the Oriental <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the Councils of <a href="01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, and while condemning them, since they were in substance <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a>, he sought to show that sometimes the difference between the doctrines of certain <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a> was rather in the words than in the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, which led to his counselling the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the West to be reserved in their condemnation. He was sharply reproached for his indulgence by certain ardent <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the leader of whom was Lucifer, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03139c.htm">Cagliari</a>. However, in 359, the city of <a href="13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> witnessed the assembly in synod of a large number of Oriental <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, nearly all of whom were either <a href="05605a.htm">Anomoeans</a> or <a href="13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>. Hilary, whom everyone wished to see and hear, so great was his <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a> for learning and virtue, was invited to be present at this assembly. The governor of the province even furnished him with post horses for the journey. In presence of the Greek fathers he set forth the doctrines of the Gallic <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and easily <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that, contrary to the opinion current in the East, these latter were not Sabellians. Then he took part in the violent discussions which took place between the <a href="13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>, who inclined toward reconciliation with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the <a href="05605a.htm">Anomoeans</a>, who formed as it were the extreme left of <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>.</p>

<p>After the council, which had no result beyond the wider separation of these brothers in enmity, he left for Constantinople, the stronghold of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, to continue his battle against <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>. But while the <a href="13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>, who were less numerous and less powerful, besought him to become the intermediary in a reconciliation between themselves and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the West, the <a href="05605a.htm">Anomoeans</a>, who had the immense advantage of being upheld by the emperor, besought the latter to send back to his own country this Gallic <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who, they said, sowed discord and troubled the Orient. Constantius acceded to their desire, and the exile was thus enabled to set out on his journey home. In 361 Hilary re-entered Poitiers in triumph and resumed possession of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. He was welcomed with the liveliest <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> by his flock and his brothers in the episcopate, and was visited by Martin, his former disciple and subsequently <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>. The success he had achieved in his combat against <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> was rendered more brilliant shortly afterwards by the deposition of Saturninus, the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles by whom he had been <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. However, as in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> the memory still rankled of the efforts he had made to bring about a reconciliation between the nearly converted <a href="13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, he went in 364 to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> to endeavour to overcome the intolerance of the partisans of the Bishop Lucifer mentioned above. Almost immediately afterwards, that it might be seen that, if he was full of indulgence for those whom gentleness might finally win from <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, he was intractable towards those who were obstinate in their adherence to it, he went to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, there to assail openly Auxentius, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, who was a firm defender of the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> doctrines. But the Emperor Valentinian, who protected the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>, ordered Hilary to depart immediately from <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>.</p>

<p>He then returned to his city of <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, from which he was not again to absent himself and where he was to die. This learned and energetic <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> had fought against <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> with the pen as well as in words. The best edition of his numerous and remarkable writings is that published by Dom Constant under the title: "Sancti Hilarii, Pictavorum episcopi opera, ad manuscriptos codices gallicanos, romanos, belgicos, necnon ad veteres editiones castigata" (Paris, 1693). The <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> celebrates his <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> on 14 January, and <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> raised him to the rank of <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor of the Universal Church</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Puy glories in the supposed possession of his <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>, but according to one tradition his body was borne to the church of St-Denys near <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, while according to another it was taken from the church of St-Hilaire at <a href="12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> and burned by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in 1572.</p>
