<p>(KILDARENSIS ET LEIGHLINENSIS)</p>

<p>One of the four suffragans of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. These two <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> continued to be separate from their foundation until 1678, when, owing to the extreme tenuity of the episcopal revenues &mdash; about fifteen pounds sterling a year each &mdash; the Diocese of Leighlin was given <em><a href="07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kildare, Dr. Mark Forstall. The <a href="08636c.htm">Diocese of Kildare</a> includes the northern half of that county, the eastern portion of King's County, as far as Tullamore, and the two northern baronies of Queen's County, and it embraces the ancient territories of Offaly, Carbury, and Hy Faelain. Its direction lies east and west. The Diocese of Leighlin lies north and south, including one half of Queen's County, all County Carlow, and portions of Kilkenny, Wexford, and Wicklow Counties. It embraces ancient Leix, which connects it with Kildare and a portion of Ui Ceinnsealaigh. The united <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is one of the largest <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, comprising 1,029,829 acres; and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population according to the census of 1901, was 130,377, out of a total of 149,168.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>When <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> had preached the Gospel in the North and West of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he turned his steps to the South, and coming into Leinster from <a href="10097a.htm">Meath</a> by Druim Urchailli he passed through Straffan and Clane to Naas. Pitching his tent on its green, he there <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> its joint kins, Ailill and Illan, sons of Dunling, and Ailill's two daughters, Mogain and Fedelm. Their people seeing this soon embraced the Gospel also, and <a href="11554a.htm">Patrick</a> placed his nephew, Auxilius, as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Kilashee, a few miles south of Naas, and Iserninus with Mac Tail as <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Old Kilcullen. From here he went towards Athy, founding churches at Narraghmore and other places, and, crossing the Barrow, continued his journey by Ballyadams and Stradbally to Morett. Here he built a <a href="02781a.htm">church</a> and then turning north re-crossed the Barrow south of Rathangan, and going by Lullymore, Allen, and Kilcock, he returned to Tara. These events occurred about the year 448. Later on <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> made a second journey into Leinster, and coming to Rathvilly in County Carlow he <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> King Crimthan, his wife Mel, and his son and heir, Dathi. He translated Iserninus (Fith) from Kilcullen to Aghade. At Donaghmore in Ui Ceinnsealaigh he met his old friend Dubtach, the chief bard of Erin, who alone amongst King Laoghaire's hosts had stood up to salute him at Tara. He was accompanied by Fiacc, his gifted pupil and successor-apparent. <a href="11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, being in need of a suitable candidate for the <a href="02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Fiacc on Dubtach's recommendation, and placed him at Domnach Fiacc, midway between Clonmore and Aghold. Years afterwards he transferred him to Sletty, blessing his church there, and making his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> quasi-metropolitan. This pre-eminence afterwards passed to <a href="06045a.htm">Ferns</a>, then to Kildare, and later on to Dublin. The fame of Fiacc's virtues and <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> followed him from Domnach Fiacc, bringing crowds of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to Sletty, and soon a large <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> grew up of which he was the first <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>. <a href="06066b.htm">St. Fiacc</a> practiced extraordinary austerities even in his old age, spending each <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> in the cave of Drum Coblai (the doon of Clopook), so that the fame of his <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> still survives in the district. He died in 510. In the next century the See of Sletty was transferred to Leighlin, which means either "the half glen" or "the white plain."</p>

<p>St. Laserian (also called Molaise) was the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of Leighlin, b. 566; d. 18 April, 639. He was the son of Cairel de Blitha, a Ulidian noble, and Gemma, daughter of a Scottish king. Part of his youth was spent in <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. On his return home he refused the chieftainship of his clan, went into retirement, and ultimately set out for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he studied for fourteen years and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>. Returning to Leighlin he entered the great <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> which <a href="06607b.htm">St. Gobban</a> had established, and soon found himself its <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, <a href="06607b.htm">St. Gobban</a> having retired in his favour and gone into <a href="11342b.htm">Ossory</a>. This establishment soon became famous, and contained as many as 1500 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. St. Laserian took the leading part in settling the <a href="05228a.htm">Easter controversy</a>. In the Synod of Magh-lene he successfully defended the Roman computation, and was sent by the council as delegate to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There, in 633, he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Leighlin by Honorius I. On his return from the centre of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity Laserian pleaded the cause of the Roman practice so powerfully at another synod in Leighlin that the controversy was practically ended for the greater part of the country. The list of his successors, sometimes called <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> and sometimes <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, is practically complete. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Leighlin was built about the middle of the twelfth century in the plainest Gothic, to replace the original church of wood. It was plundered several times both by the Danes and by the native chieftains, and the great religious establishments of Sletty and Killeshin shared the same fate. In the reign of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> it was seized by the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, was made a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church, and has continued as such ever since. The sufferings of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were so intense during the persecutions which raged over <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> for more than two centuries, that towards the end but a remnant of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> remained. What the number of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was in these <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> before the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, we cannot say for certain; but from the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ruins we have the means of forming a fair estimate. Over these <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, at the present day, there lie scattered the mouldering ruins of 240 churches and 63 <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, bearing mute but eloquent testimony to the persecutions borne by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and to the numbers of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> who suffered banishment or death. Nor were these <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> small or unimportant; there were many large <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the different <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, including the four great <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbeys of Abbeyleix, Baltinglass, Duiske, and Monasterevan. The <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> church of Duiske, Graignamanagh, is one of the few <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> churches at present in possession of their rightful owners, and actually devoted to the service of the old religion. There were eight round towers in these <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, two of which are still entire, Kildare and Timahoe. The earthen rampart of the Pale can be traced for a mile between Clane and Clongowes College.</p>

<h2>Abbey and Shrine of St. Brigid</h2>

<p>Before the time of St. Laserian of Leighlin, St. Conleth and <a href="02784b.htm">St. Brigid</a> were the <a href="11562a.htm">patron saints</a> of Kildare. The latter was a native of the district, though born at Faughart, near Dundalk. In 487 she received the religious habit from St. Macaille, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Croghan in Offaly, and coming to Kildare formed a community of the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> virgins who flocked around her. Her first house was a <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> cell under a large oak, which gave Kildare its name &mdash; <em>Cill-Dara</em>, the cell of the oak. The fame of her <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> attracted such a concourse of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to Kildare that a city soon sprang up which included a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> community of men. To meet the spiritual wants of the new city St. Brigid requested the appointment of a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Great deference was paid to her wishes, and, as she had recommended St. Conleth, he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kildare about 490. He had been leading the life of a <a href="07280a.htm">recluse</a> at Old Connell near Newbridge, was a skillful artificer in gold and silver; and the ancient <a href="04515c.htm">crosier</a> in the museum of the Royal Academy is believed to be the work of his hands. It is said that as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> he made a journey to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and returned with vestments for his church at <a href="08636c.htm">Kildare</a>, in which latter place he died, 3 May, 519. A fire was kept burning day and night at <a href="08636c.htm">Kildare</a> by St. Brigid for the use of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and travellers, and for the same purpose, as well as in memory of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, it was continued till the total suppression of the <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> at the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The firehouse was a cell or vault twenty feet square, and its ruins existed till 1792. The first church of Kildare was probably of wood, and, being designed for two communities of different sexes, the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> was divided by a partition or screen. For an account of the church and its relics see SAINT BRIGID. Kildare with its church was plundered and burned frequently. Sometimes it suffered from the Danes, sometimes from the native chieftains, and sometimes by accident. Its records give about twenty-five catastrophes of the kind. At the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was seized by the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and a portion of it was used for a church. The rest of the building became a ruin, and so remained till 1875-96, when it was completely restored by private contributions, and is now the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.</p>

<h2>Bishops of Kildare</h2>

<p>The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Kildare were frequently called abbot-bishops and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Leinster down to the Synod of Kells. The record of succession is practically complete down to the union of the two <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. For the episcopal lists see, besides <a href="06376a.htm">Gams</a> and Eubel, Brady, "Episcopal Succession in England, Scotland, and Ireland" (Rome, 1877). Dr. Leverous (1497-1577) was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kildare in 1555, and early in Elizabeth's reign, when the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were summoned before the Lord Deputy to take the <a href="11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kildare pre-emptorily refused, and being asked the reason of his refusal replied: "All <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority is from <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who has never conferred it on a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>, even His blessed mother. How then can it be sworn that in future ages <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> would confer it on a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>?" He added: "The Apostle has commanded that no <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> should dare even to speak with authority in the church much less to preside and govern there." He was deprived of his temporalities, forced to fly for safety to Adare, Co. Limerick, where he conducted a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, and finally returning he died at Naas, aged 80.</p>

<p>The <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of Kildare was among the most famous in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (see <a href="08636c.htm">SCHOOL OF KILDARE</a>). There were also great and ancient <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> at Sletty, Killeshin, Tullow, Clonenagh, and elsewhere in the diocese.
