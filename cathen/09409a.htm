<p>A <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a> who suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> (7 January, 312), during the reign of Maximinus Daza. According to a tradition preserved by <a href="14328a.htm">Suidas</a> (s.v.), Lucian was born at <a href="13422a.htm">Samosata</a>, of <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, and was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in the neighbouring city of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> at the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of a certain Macarius. Not much <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> can be attached to these statements, which are not corroborated by any other author; <a href="14328a.htm">Suidas</a> very probably confounded the history of Lucian with that of his famous namesake, the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> satirist of a century earlier. The confusion is easily pardoned, however, as both exhibited the same <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> traits and the same <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for cold literalism.</p>

<p>Early in life Lucian took up his residence at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, where he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and where he soon attained a commanding position as head of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in that city. Though he cannot be accused of having shared the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> views of <a href="11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, he fell under suspicion at the time of Paul's condemnation, and was compelled to sever his communion with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This breach with the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party lasted during the episcopates of three <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Domnus, Timaeus, and Cyril, whose administration extended from 268 to 303. It seems more likely that Lucian was reconciled with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> early in the episcopate of Cyril (perhaps about 285) than in that of his successor; otherwise it is hard to understand how <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the Orient could have received his pupils. Very little is known about the life of Lucian, though few men have left such a deep print on the history of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The opposition to the allegorizing tendencies of the Alexandrines centred in him. He rejected this system entirely and propounded a system of literal interpretation which dominated the <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> for a long period. In the field of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, in the minds of practically all writers (the most notable modern exception being Gwatkin, in his "Studies of Arianism", London, 1900), he has the unenviable reputation of being the real author of the opinions which afterwards found expression in the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Arius. In his <a href="14597a.htm">Christological</a> system &mdash; a compromise between Modalism and Subordinationism &mdash; the Word, though Himself the Creator of all subsequent beings was a creature, though superior to all other created things by the wide gulf between Creator and creature. The great leaders in the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian movement</a> (Arius himself, <a href="05623b.htm">Eusebius</a>, the court <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, Maris, and Theognis) received their training under him and always <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> him as their master and the founder of their system.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Despite his <a href="07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a>, Lucian was a man of the most unexceptionable virtue (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250108.htm"><em>Church History</em> VIII.13.2</a>); at the height of the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversy his fame for <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> was not less than his reputation as a scholar. During the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Maximinus Daza he was arrested at Antioch and sent to <a href="11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, where he endured many tortures and, after delivering a long oration in defence of his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, was finally <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a>. The most enduring memorial of the life of Lucian, next to the <a href="14597a.htm">Christological</a> controversy which his teachings aroused was his influence on Biblical study. Receiving the literal sense alone he laid stress on the need of textual accuracy and himself undertook to revise the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> on the original Hebrew. His edition was widely used in the fourth century (Jerome, De Vir. III. lxxvii Praef. ad Paralip.; Adv. Rufium xxvi, Epis., 106). He also published a recension of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (De Vir. Ill, 77), in addition to the recension of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, speaks of "Libelli de Fide", none of which are extant. He is also credited with the composition of a Creed, presented to the Council of Antioch in 341 (Athan., "Ep. de Synod. Arim. et Seleuc". xxiii), but his authorship is <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>; in fact it is certain he did not compose it in its present form. Rufinus (H. E., IX, vi) has preserved a translation of his apologetic oration. There are epistles mentioned by <a href="14328a.htm">Suidas</a>; a fragment of one announces the death of Anthimus, a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> ("Chronicon Paschale in P.G. XCII, 689).</p>
