<p>These councils have a unique importance for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> inasmuch as the earlier ones legislated for practically the whole territory of the Republic, and furnished moreover a norm for all the later provincial councils of the country. This article touches on only those parts of the legislation which may seem in any way to individualize the <a href="05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> or depict the peculiar needs and difficulties of its nascent period.</p>

<p>I. The First <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> was held in 1829 and was attended by one <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and four <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Its decrees refer to the enactments of two previous conventions which may be summarized briefly. Bishop Carroll's Diocesan Synod of 1791 decreed: (No. 3) The ceremonies of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> need not be supplied for converted <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> who had been previously validly <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>. (No. 4) As a rule children are not to be confirmed before the age of reason. (No. 5) The offerings of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> are to be divided into three parts: for the support of the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>, the relief of the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the sustentation of the church. (No. 11) The faithful are to be warned that the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> not approved by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is invalid. (No. 15) None are to be married until they <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="05075b.htm">Christian Doctrine</a>. Slaves, however, need <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> only the principal <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a>, if more cannot be acquired. (No. 16) In <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> the non-Catholic must promise before witnesses to bring up the offspring of the union as <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. (No. 17) Hymns and <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the vernacular are to be encouraged at evening services. (No. 20) <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> may work on days of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> owing to the circumstances of place, but they must hear Mass if possible. (No. 23) The rich are to be warned that they <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> grievously if, through their parsimony, <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> cannot be sustained and multiplied. (No. 24) When there is question of refusing <a href="03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be consulted beforehand when possible.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The second series of enactments referred to are the articles concerning <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> sanctioned by the common consent of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and the other American <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in 1810. The main articles are: (No. 2) Regulars should not be withdrawn from pastoral work without the consent of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, if their assistance be deemed a necessity to the existence or prosperity of their missions. (No. 3) The <a href="05140a.htm">Douay version</a> of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> is to be used. (No. 5) Baptism must be conferred in the church where possible. (No. 6) If no sponsor can be obtained, private <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> only is to be administered. (No. 9) The faithful are to be warned against improper theatres, dances, and novels. (No. 10) <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> cannot be admitted to the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.</p>

<p>Besides ordering the publication of these decrees along with their own synodical enactments, the fathers of the First <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> decreed: (No. 1) Priests should labour in any mission assigned to them by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. (No. 5) Owing to the abuses of lay trustees all future churches should be consigned to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> when possible. (No. 6) Trustees cannot institute or dismiss a <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>. No <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> patronage exists in this country. (No. 10) Infants of non-Catholics may be <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> if their <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> promise to give them a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, but the sponsor must be a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. (No. 20) In administering the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and in the burial service, Latin and not English must be employed. (No. 31) A ceremonial written in English is to be drawn up. (No. 34) <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> should be erected.</p>

<p>At one of the sessions of this council several lawyers (among them <a href="14442c.htm">R.B. Taney</a>, afterwards Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>) gave advice to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> on points of American law concerning <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>. In addition to their decrees, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> asked and obtained from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> permission to use for adults the formula of infant <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; to <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water with the form approved for the missionaries of <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and to extend the time for fulfilling the paschal precept, i.e. from the first <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> to <a href="15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a>.</p>

<p>II. The Second Council, held in 1833, was attended by one <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and nine <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The main decrees were: (No. 3) A delimitation of the American <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. (No. 4) A method of selecting <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which a later Council (Prov. VII) modified. (No. 5) Recommending the entrusting to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of the Indian missions in the West, as also (No. 6) the missions among former American slaves, repatriated in Liberia, <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, to the same fathers. (No. 8) Bishops are exhorted to erect <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>.</p>

<p>III. The Third Council in 1837 was composed of one <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and eight <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Its decrees enacted: (No. 4) <a href="12466a.htm">Ecclesiastical property</a> is to be secured by the best means the <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> affords. (No. 6) Ecclesiastics should not bring <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cases before the civil tribunals. (No. 7) Priests are prohibited from soliciting money outside their own <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. (No. 8) Pastors are warned against permitting unsuitable music at Divine worship. (No. 9) The two days following <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost are to be days of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> no longer. (No. 10) Wednesdays in <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a> are not to be days of fast and abstinence.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>IV. The Fourth Council in 1840 issued decrees signed by one <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and twelve <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> as follows: (No. 1) In <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> no sacred rites or vestments are to be used. (No. 5) Temperance <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> are recommended to the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. (No. 6) Pastors are to see that those frequenting public <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> do not use the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> version of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> or sing sectarian <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>. They must also employ their influence against the introduction of such practices into the public <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. (No. 8) Bishops are to control <a href="12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> and not permit <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to hold it in their own name. Among those attending this council was the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10680a.htm">Nancy</a> and Toul, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, to whom the fathers granted a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to a decisive vote. A letter of consolation was sent by the council to the <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and another of thanks to the moderators of the Leopold Institute of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna, Austria</a>.</p>

<p>V. In 1843, the Fifth Council was attended by one <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and sixteen <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Among its enactments were: (No. 2) Laymen may not deliver orations in churches. (No. 4) It is not expedient that the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> decrees concerning <a href="04001a.htm">clandestine matrimony</a> be extended to places where they have not been already <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. (No. 5) Pastors are to be <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to observe the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of residence. (No. 6) Priests may not borrow money for church uses without written permission of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<p>VI. The Sixth Council (One <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and twenty-two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> attending) in 1846, decreed: (No. 1) that the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> <a href="07674d.htm">conceived without sin</a> is chosen as the patron of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. (No. 2) Priests <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <em>titulo missionis</em> may not enter a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order without permission of their ordinaries. (No. 3) The canons concerning the proclaiming of the <a href="02255a.htm">banns of matrimony</a> are to be observed. At the request of the fathers, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> sanctioned a formula to be used by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in taking the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> at their <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>.</p>

<p>VII. In 1849 two <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and twenty-three <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> held the Seventh Council. The main decrees were: (No. 2) The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is to be informed that the fathers think it opportune to define as a <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. (No. 3) A change in the election of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in introduced. (No. 5) Bishops are not to give an <em>exeat</em> at the request of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> unless it be certain that another <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> will receive him. (No. 6) Priests are forbidden to assist at the marriages of those who have already had a <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> performed by a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister, or who intend to have such <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> performed. (No. 7) A national council should be held in Baltimore in 1850, by Apostolic Authority. The fathers moreover petitioned the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to raise <a href="11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, and New York to <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> dignity and to make a new limitation of the Provinces of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and St. Louis. They desired likewise that <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> should be declared the <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> see of the Republic. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> granted the first part of the petition, but deferred acting on the question of primacy.</p>

<p>VIII. The Eighth Council was assembled in 1855. One <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and seven <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> or their representatives attended it. This council enacted: (No. 1) The fathers joyfully receive the dogmatic decision of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> defining the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. (No. 2) Priests are warned that after August, 1857, adults must be <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> according to the regular formula for that service in the <a href="13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> and not according to that for infant <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. (No. 4) No tax is to be demanded for <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> from matrimonial impediments. (No. 6) Bishops are exhorted to increase the number of their <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors to ten or twelve. It will not be <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, however, to obtain the opinion of all of them, even on important matters. For this, the counsel of three or four will suffice. On the death of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, all the consultors shall send to the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> their written opinions as to an eligible successor for the vacant see. (No. 7) The various <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> should determine on the best mode of providing for the proper support of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. (No. 8) The fathers desire to see an American College erected in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. To the Acts of this council is appended a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, sanctioning a mode of procedure in judicial causes of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>.</p>

<p>IX. The Ninth Council in 1858 was attended by one <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and seven <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The main work of this synod consisted in drawing up petitions to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> concerning a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from abstinence on Saturdays; the conceding of certain honorary privileges to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>; the granting to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> the permission to allow the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> to be kept in <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities not subject to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of enclosure. All of these petitions were granted by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. That concerning the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> granted to him, as ruler of the mother-church of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, an honorary pre-eminence, to consist in his taking precedence of any other <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in the country, without regard to promotion or <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and in his having the place of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> in all councils and conventions. The fathers also sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> an inquiry as to the nature of the <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> (solemn or simple) of religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, especially of Visitation Nuns in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> an answer to which was deferred to a later time (1864). The question was also discussed as to whether <a href="08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick's</a> version of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> should be approved for general use. It was finally decided to wait for <a href="10794a.htm">Dr. John Henry Newman's</a> expected version, and then to determine along with the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of other English-speaking countries on one common version.</p>

<p>X. In 1869, the Tenth Council enacted decrees that were signed by one <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, twelve <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and one <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Among these decrees we note: (No. 5) Bishops are exhorted to establish missions and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for the <a href="12627a.htm">negroes</a> of their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. (No. 7) Priests are to be appointed to aid the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in administering the temporal concerns of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. They are also to supervise the spiritual and material affairs of religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. At the request of the fathers, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> extended for five years the privilege of using the short formula in the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of adults.</p>

<p>It should be remarked that the first seven <a href="12515a.htm">provincial councils</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> were practically, though not formally, <a href="12164c.htm">plenary council</a> of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>.</p>
