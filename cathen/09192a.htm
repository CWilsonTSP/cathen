<p>(LEYS)</p>

<p>A <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> of high reputation, born at Brecht, in the province of <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1 October, 1554; died at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 15 January, 1623. His <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, honest people of the farming class, died when he was but six years old. In 1568 he entered the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="01752c.htm">Arras</a> in the <a href="09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, and there studied classics and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. His brilliant talents enabled him to become doctor in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the age of seventeen years; and although he did not learn Greek till later, he mastered it so well that he could mentally translate into that language the reading he heard in the refectory, and sometimes wrote his private notes in Greek. Professors vied with one another in seeking to have him as their pupil. In 1572, and not, as the date is sometimes given, in 1573, he entered the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and after two years' <a href="11144a.htm">noviceship</a> was sent to <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> to teach <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">College</a> there till 1581. He studied <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he had Francis Francisco Su&aacute;rez as his professor for two years. In 1585 he was back again at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> as professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">College</a> and held this chair for fifteen years. When he had given up teaching, he was urged by his superiors and companions to publish the lectures on <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> which he had delivered with such great success; this he did, yielding at last to their wishes. He was twice sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the members of the Gallo-Belgian province to the general congregations of his order in 1608 and 1615. Cardinal <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and other dignitaries of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> endeavoured, though unsuccessfully, to retain him in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to attach him to the Sacred Penitentiary. He was consulted from all quarters, and corresponded on <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> matters with the most learned <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the day, such as <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Vasquez, Molina, etc. But he longed to have done with studying and writing books, that he might turn to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and contemplation towards the end of his career. His remains are in the choir of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church in <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. Leonard Lessius was a man of great virtue and of great <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>; his modesty and <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> were equal to his learning, nor did he ever hesitate to give up his own opinion when good arguments against it were presented to him; his charity, meekness, patience, and <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> were remarkable throughout his long life, in spite of the trying disease he contracted when fleeing from <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> to escape the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. <a href="15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a>, who had known him personally, paid a special tribute to his <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; St. Francis of Sales also esteemed him highly for his virtue and his <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. After his death, authentic information was taken about his life and virtues; he is now ranked among the venerable, and the process of his <a href="02364b.htm">beatification</a> has been introduced.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The literary activity of Lessius was not confined to dogmatic and moral matters; he wrote also on asceticism and controversy. We give here the most important of his works; the whole list may be seen in Sommervogel. The first printed lines which came from the pen of Lessius, i.e. "Theses theologic&aelig;" (Louvain, 1586), provoked a fiery debate with the <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>; the theses of Lessius and Hamelius, both professors at the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">College</a>, were attacked as containing dangerous opinions on <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a>, grace, inspiration in <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, etc. As to the last point, Lessius had merely suggested an hypothesis on subsequent inspiration, i.e. that a book written without the help of the Holy Ghost might become <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, if the Holy Ghost apparently declared that the said book did not contain anything <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>. The condemnations issued by the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> did not touch this view of Lessius. The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Lessius on grace and <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a>, which was accused of Semipelagianism, taught <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a> "post pr&aelig;visa merita", the co-operation of <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a> with grace in such a way as to reject the "gratia per se efficax"; in fact, this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was by no means peculiar to Lessius. Apologies, antitheses, anti-apologies, succeeded on both sides; the Universities of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> censured the theses; the faculties of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of Ingolstadt, <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> approved them; the general of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and at last the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was appealed to. Finally <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, who in a letter called the incriminated articles "articuli san&aelig; doctrin&aelig;", charged his <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Octavio Frangipani, to bring the discussions to an end till the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> should have decided the question; Frangipani (1588) forbade both sides, under threat of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, to discuss the matter or to charge each other with <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>The great work of Lessius is "De justitia et jure", which was published in 1605 and was dedicated to the Archduke Albert. Many editions followed at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Paris, and <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>. This work, composed with great accuracy, shows best the soundness of judgment, the common sense, and the clearness of mind which distinguishes Lessius. The chapters on interest and other commercial subjects are epoch-making in the treatment of those difficult questions; Lessius was especially consulted by the merchants of <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> on matters of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. Archduke Albert had the book constantly on his desk and referred to it as a guide. A good compendium of the work was published at <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a> in 1634. Four years later a work of quite a different nature was written by Lessius under the title, "Qu&aelig; fides et religio sit capessenda" (Antwerp, 1609). It is a short book of some 150 pages, on controversy and <a href="01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, which brought about a great many conversions, among them that of John of Nassau. The book was often reprinted and was translated into <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a>, German, Italian, <a href="07547a.htm">Hungarian</a>, Polish, and French. The work "De gratia efficaci", on grace, liberty, <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a>, etc., appeared in 1610; with the "De justitia" it secures Lessius a place among the best <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the day in dogmatic as well as in moral questions. Some writings of a controversial character were published between 1611 and 1619; "De Antichristo et ejus pr&aelig;cursoribus"; "Defensio potestatis summi pontificis", against the theories put forward by James I, King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, Barclay, Blackwell, etc. A work on Providence and the <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> was printed in 1613 "De Providentia Numinis", and translated into different languages, even into Chinese. His "Hygiasticon" or plea for sobriety, a treatise on how to preserve strength and to live long, was published in 1613, often reprinted and translated into nearly all the languages of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>; it is a translation of a similar work by Cornaro (Luigi Cornaro, an Italian hygienist, 1467-1566), accompanied with the personal reflections of Lessius. Even now it is not without interest.</p>

<p>Among his <a href="14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works, which are noted for the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> they contain, must be mentioned his "De summo bono" (Antwerp, 1616); "De perfectionibus moribusque divinis libri XIV" (Antwerp, 1620); and especially his posthumous work, on the Divine names, "Quinquaginta nomina Dei" (Brussels, 1640), very often reprinted and translated. After his death was published his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatise on the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the Incarnation, etc. (De beatitudine, de actibus humanis, de incarnatione Verbi, de sacramentis et censuris, etc., Louvain, 1645). Not a few of his unprinted works are preserved at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and elsewhere; they are made up especially of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises, notes on <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, some letters and documents on the discussion mentioned above, answers to various consultations, etc. No complete edition of Lessius's works has ever appeared. The books "De perfectionibus divinis", "De gratia efficaci", "De summo bono", etc. were published in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1878-81); "De divinis nominibus" and "De summo bono" at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> (1862 and 1869); <a href="02711e.htm">Bouix</a> made a new <a href="06190a.htm">French</a> translation of the "De divinis nominibus" (Paris, 1882).</p>
