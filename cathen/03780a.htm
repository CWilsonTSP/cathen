<p>An association of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> formed in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to perpetuate the movement which had found expression in the "Declaration and Protestation" signed by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body in 1789. These principles represent a remarkable reaction against the attitude hitherto traditional among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which seems to have begun about the time of the death of the Pretender in 1766. Up to then they had been stanch <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, and had looked to the restoration of the Stuarts as the only chance for a revival of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. About this time, however, by what <a href="02491a.htm">Berington</a> calls "one of those singular revolutions for which no cause can be assigned" (State and Behaviour of English Catholics in 1780, p. 134), they gave up their former political aspirations, and frankly accepted the reigning House of <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a>. Part of the reaction was a suspicion of the wisdom of their <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rulers, who, they became convinced had adopted in the past a needlessly strict attitude, opposed to English national aspirations and which (they contended) had been dictated by the Court of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>They reverted to the Oath of Allegiance of the reign of King James I, which they declared them- selves willing to take, while some even maintained that the Oath of Supremacy could be interpreted in a sense not inconsistent with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. These were the principles which animated the well-known <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Committee (1782-92) in their struggle for emancipation. The two chief leaders were Lord Petre and Sir John Throckmorton, both members of old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>, who had suffered much in times past under the <a href="11611c.htm">Penal Laws</a>. They had the active assistance of Charles Butler, the distinguished lawyer, nephew of Alban Butler, who acted as secretary to the committee. The greater number (though by no means all) of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> aristocracy, who in those days were the practical supporters of religion sympathized with them and, in a modified degree some of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. One <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="02490b.htm">Charles Berington</a>, was on their side, and the Rev. Joseph Wilkes, O.S.B., who was a member of the committee, went to great lengths in supporting them. <a href="14432a.htm">Dr. James Talbot</a> (Vicar Apostolic of the London District, 1781-90) also allowed his name to be added and showed a weakness in opposing them which he regretted on his death-bed, and which made the task of his successor, Dr. Douglass (1790-1812), a difficult one.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1788, Lord Stanhope, a member of the Established Church, desiring to help the committee, and <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> that their supposed "Ultramontane" principles, and in particular their accredited <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in the "deposing power" of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, were the chief obstacles in their way, drew out a "Protestation" disclaiming these in unmeasured language. The commitee adopted the Protestation and early in the following year called upon all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to sign it. Butler admits that it was only with some difficulty that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were induced to sign; but they did sign, and were followed by two hundred and forty <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> (out of about two hundred and sixty) and by all the chief <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> of the country. Two of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> afterwards revoked their signatures and <a href="10315a.htm">Milner</a>, who was one of those who had signed, took an active part in opposing the commitee. The result of their labours was the Act of 1791. In the first draft there had been an "Oath of Declaration, Protestation and Allegiance", based on the Protestation of 1789, but going to even greater lengths. This <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> was definitely condemned by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, led by the venerable <a href="15539b.htm">Dr. Walmesley</a>, in 1789 and 1791. After a sharp conflict it was removed from the bill during its passage through Parliament, and the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Oath of 1774 substituted. As the act in its final state failed to embody the principles of the Protestation, new <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was formed to perpetuate these, under the ominous title of "The Cisalpine Club". Others besides the members of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Committee were invited to join the club, and the membership usually numbered between forty and fifty. They met four or five times a year, each meeting being preceded by a dinner. At first they took an active part in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs, though consistently disclaiming any representative character. In several ways they succeeded in guarding <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, and by their influence a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was established at Oscott, directed by a governing body of <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> though the headmaster was a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, appointed by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. After a few years, however, the Cisalpine Club ceased to perform any active work, and developed into mere dining club. At the beginning the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had naturally viewed it askance, although indeed in private life the members were all devout and edifying, and often the chief supporters of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities. As time went on, their Cisalpine tendencies became less and less marked, and they got on good terms with Bishop Poynter (1803-1826), who only regretted the unfortunate name of the club. Soon after the passing of Catholic Emancipation (1829) this was remedied by the members re-forming themselves into a new club, which they called the "Emancipation Club", and which continued for seventeen more years before finally dissolving. (See <a href="03090b.htm">CHARLES BUTLER</a>.)</p>
