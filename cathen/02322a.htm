<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>Under the name of <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a> are included all the religious who follow the Rule of St. Basil. The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of such religious have never possessed the hierarchical organization which ordinarily exists in the houses of an order properly so called. Only a few houses were formerly grouped into congregations or are today so combined. <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> drew up his Rule for the members of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> he founded about 356 on the banks of the Iris in Cappadocia. Before forming this community St. Basil visited <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Palestine, Coelesyria, and Mesopotamia in order to see for himself the manner of life led by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in these countries. <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, who shared the retreat, aided Basil by his advice and experience. The Rule of Basil is divided into two parts: the "Greater Monastic Rules" (Regulae fusius tractatae, <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XXXI, 889-1052), and the "Lesser Rules" (Regulae brevius tractatae, ibid., 1051-1306). Rufinus who translated them into Latin united the two into a single Rule under the name of "Regulae sancti Basilii episcopi Cappadociae ad monachos" (P.L., CIII, 483-554); this Rule was followed by some western <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. For a long time the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> was wrongly held to be the author of a work on monasticism called "Contitutiones monasticae" (P.G., XXXI, 1315-1428). In his Rule St. Basil follows a <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> method; the disciple asks a question to which the master replies. He limits himself to laying down indisputable principles which will guide the superiors and <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in their conduct. He sends his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> to the <a href="../bible.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>; in his eyes the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> is the basis of all monastic legislation, the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> Rule. The questions refer generally to the virtues which the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> should practice and the vices they should avoid. The greater number of the replies contain a verse or several verses of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> accompanied by a comment which defines the meaning. The most striking qualities of the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Rule are its <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and its wisdom. It leaves to the superiors the care of settling the many details of local, individual, and daily life; it does not determine the material exercise of the observance or the administrative regulations of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Poverty, obedience, renunciation, and self-abnegation are the virtues which St. Basil makes the foundation of the monastic life.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As he gave it, the Rule could not suffice for anyone who wished to organize a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, for it takes this work as an accomplished fact. The life of the Cappadocian <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> could not be reconstructed from his references to the nature and number of the meals and to the garb of the inmates. The superiors had for guide a tradition accepted by all the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. This tradition was enriched as time went on by the decisions of councils, by the ordinances of the Emperors of Constantinople, and by the regulations of a number of revered <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>. Thus there arose a body of law by which the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were regulated. Some of these <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> were accepted by all, others were observed only by the houses of some one country, while there were regulations which applied only to certain communities. In this regard Oriental monasticism bears much resemblance to that of the West; a great variety of observances is noticeable. The existence of the Rule of St. Basil formed a principle of unity.</p>

<h2 id="section2">The monasteries of the east</h2>

<p>The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Cappadocia were the first to accept the Rule of St. Basil; it afterwards spread gradually to all the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the East. Those of <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, Chaldea, and of the Syrian countries in general preferred instead of the Rule of St. Basil those observances which were known among them as the Rule of St. Anthony. Neither the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> nor the imperial authority was exerted to make conformity to the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> Rule universal. It is therefore impossible to tell the epoch at which it acquired the supremacy in the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of the Greek world; but the date is probably an early one. The development of monasticism was, in short, the cause of its diffusion. Protected by the emperors and <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> increased rapidly in number. In 536 the Diocese of Constantinople contained no less than sixty-eight, that of Chalcedon forty, and these numbers continually increased. Although monasticism was not able to spread in all parts of the empire with equal rapidity, yet what it probably must have been may be inferred from these figures. These <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> took an active part in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life of their time; they had a share in all the quarrels, both <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and other, and were associated with all the <a href="03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. Their <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were places of refuge for studious men. Many of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were chosen from their ranks. Their history is interwoven, therefore, with that of the <a href="05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>. They gave to the preaching of the Gospel its greatest apostles. As a result monastic life gained a footing at the same time as <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> among all the races won to the Faith. The position of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> in the empire was one of great power, and their wealth helped to increase their influence. Thus their development ran a course parallel to that of their Western brethren. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, as a rule, followed the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> vicissitudes of the emperors and <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, and they showed no notable independence except during the <a href="07620a.htm">iconoclastic persecution</a>; the stand they took in this aroused the <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a> of the imperial controversialists. The Faith had its <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> among them; many of them were condemned to exile, and some took advantage of this condemnation to reorganize their <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>

<p>Of all the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of this period the most celebrated was that of <a href="14316c.htm">St. John the Baptist of Studium</a>, founded at Constantinople in the fifth century. It acquired its fame in the time of the <a href="07620a.htm">iconoclastic persecution</a> while it was under the government of the saintly <em>Hegumenos</em> (<a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>) Theodore, called the Studite. Nowhere did the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> emperors meet with more <a href="06147a.htm">courageous</a> resistance. At the same time the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was an active center of <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and artistic life and a model which exercised considerable influence on monastic observances in the East. Further details may be found in "Prescriptio constitutionis monasterii Studii" (<a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., XCIX, 1703-20), and the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery's</a> "Canones de confessione et pro peccatis satisfactione" (ibid., 1721-30). Theodore attributed the observances followed by his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> to his uncle, the saintly Abbot <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who first introduced them in his <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saccudium. The other <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, one after another adopted them, and they are still followed by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a>. The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> was founded towards the close of the tenth century through the aid of the Emperor Basil the Macedonian and became the largest and most celebrated of all the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the Orient; it is in reality a monastic province. The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mount Olympus in Bithynia should also be mentioned, although it was never as important as the other. The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Catherine on <a href="14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, which goes back to the early days of monasticism, had a great fame and is still occupied by <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. Reference to Oriental <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> must here be limited to those who have left a mark upon <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature: <a href="09179b.htm">Leontius of Byzantium</a> (d. 543), author of a treatise against the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and <a href="05633a.htm">Eutychians</a>; St. Sophronius, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, one of the most vigorous adversaries of the <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelite heresy</a> (P.G., LXXXVII, 3147-4014); <a href="10078b.htm">St. Maximus the Confessor</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="03743a.htm">Chrysopolis</a> (d. 662), the most brilliant representative of Byzantine monasticism in the seventh century; in his writings and letters St. Maximus steadily combated the partisans of the <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> doctrines of <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> (ibid., XC and XCI); <a href="08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, who may perhaps be included among the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a>; St Theodore the Studite (d. 829), the defender of the veneration of sacred images; his works include <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, ascetic, hagiographical, <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, and historical writings (P.G., XCIX). The Byzantine <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> furnish a long line of historians who were also <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>: <a href="08466c.htm">John Malalas</a>, whose "Monographia" (P.G., XCVII, 9-190) served as a model for Eastern chroniclers <a href="06463a.htm">Georgius Syncellus</a>, who wrote a "Selected Chronographia"; his friend and disciple <a href="14623a.htm">Theophanes</a> (d. 817), <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the "Great Field" near <a href="04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, the author of another "Chronographia" (P.G., CVIII); the Patriarch Nicephorus, who wrote (815-829) an historical "Breviarium" (a Byzantine history), and an "Abridged Chronographia" (P.G., C, 879-991); George the Monk, whose Chronicle stops at A.D. 842 (P.G. CX). There were, besides, a large number of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, hagiographers, <a href="07596a.htm">hymnologists</a>, and poets who had a large share in the development of the Greek Liturgy. Among the authors of <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> may be mentioned: St. Maximus the Confessor; St. Theodore the Studite; <a href="13163a.htm">St. Romanus the Melodist</a>; <a href="01473b.htm">St. Andrew of Crete</a>; <a href="08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>; Cosmas of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and St. Joseph the Hymnographer. Fine penmanship and the copying of <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were held in honor among the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a>. Among the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which excelled in the art of copying were the <a href="14316c.htm">Studium</a>, <a href="02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a>, the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Isle of Patmos and that of <a href="13203a.htm">Rossano</a> in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; the tradition was continued later by the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="07040b.htm">Grottaferrata</a> near <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. These <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and others as well, were studios of <a href="03710a.htm">religious art</a> where the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> toiled to produce miniatures in the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a>, and goldsmith work. The triumph of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> over the <a href="07620a.htm">iconoclastic heresy</a> infused an extraordinary enthusiasm into this branch of their labors.</p>

<p>From the beginning the <a href="05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> often took their <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Later, when the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>. Owing to this the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> formed a class apart, corresponding to the upper <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Churches</a>; this gave and still gives a preponderating influence to the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> themselves. In some of them <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> instruction is given both to <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> and to <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>. As long as the spirit of proselytism existed in the East the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> furnished the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> with all its missionaries. The names of two have been inscribed by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in its calendar of annual feasts, namely, St. Cyril and St. Methodius, the Apostles of the <a href="14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. The Byzantine <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> did not change sensibly the position of the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Their sufferings arose through the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquest. To a large number of them this conquest brought complete ruin, especially to those <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in what is now Turkey in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> and the region around Constantinople. In the East the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> adopted the Rule of St. Basil and had constitutions copied from those of the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Schismatic Basilians</h2>

<p>The two best known <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a> are those of <a href="02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> and of <a href="14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>. Besides these there are still many <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Turkey in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>, of which 10 are in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> alone, 1 at <a href="02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and 4 at <a href="08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. They are also numerous on the islands of the Aegean Sea: Chios 3, Samos 6, Crete about 50, <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> 11. In Old Cairo is the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. George. In Greece where there were formerly 400 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, there were, in 1832, only 82, which by 1904 had increased to 169; 9 <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> are now in existence in <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a>. In Rumania there are 22 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; in Servia 44, with only about 118 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>; in <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> 78, with 193 inmates. Montenegro has 11 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and about 15 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>; Bosnia 3 and Herzegovina 11. In <a href="04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> are 11 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and in Bukowina 3. <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> has 25 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and 5 branch houses. The <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> are much more numerous in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>; in this country, besides, they have the most influence and possess the richest <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Nowhere else has the monastic life been so closely interwoven with the national existence. The most celebrated <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are Pescherskoi at Kieff and Tro&iuml;tsa at <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>; mention may also be made of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Solovesk, Novgorod, Pskof, Tver, and Vladmir. <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> has about 9,000 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and 429 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. There is no diocese which has not at least one religious house. The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are divided into those having state subventions and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which do not receive such aid.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Catholic Basilians</h2>

<p>A certain number of <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were always in communion with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Among these were the houses founded in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="13203a.htm">Rossano</a>, founded by <a href="11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a> the Younger, remained for a long time faithful to the best literary traditions of Constantinople. The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of San Salvatore of <a href="10216a.htm">Messina</a> and San Salvatore of <a href="11351c.htm">Otranto</a> may be mentioned; the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="07040b.htm">Grottaferrata</a> was also celebrated. The emigration of the Greeks to the West after the fall of <a href="04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> and the union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, concluded at the <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, gave a certain prestige to these communities. <a href="02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a>, who was <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Grottaferrata, sought to stimulate the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a> by means of the literary treasures which their <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a> contained.</p>

<p>A number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communities continued to exist in the East. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> caused them to be united into congregations, namely: St. Savior founded in 1715, which includes 8 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and 21 hospices with about 250 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>; the congregation of <a href="01283b.htm">Aleppo</a> with 4 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and 2 hospices; that of the Baladites (Valadites) with 4 <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and 3 hospices. These last two congregations have their houses in the district of Mount Lebanon. St. Josaphat and Father Rutski, who labored to bring back the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Churches into <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, reformed the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a> of Lithuania. They began with the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> at <a href="15432a.htm">Vilna</a> (1607). The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Byten, founded in 1613, was the citadel of the union in <a href="09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>. Other houses adopted the reform or were founded by the reformed <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. On 19 July, 1617, the reformed <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were organized into a congregation under a proto-archimandrite, and known as the congregation of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, or of <a href="09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>. The congregation increased with the growth of the union itself. The number of houses had risen to thirty at the time of the general chapter of 1636. After the Council of Zamosc the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> outside of <a href="09292a.htm">Lithuania</a> which had not joined the congregation of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> formed themselves into a congregation bearing the title of "Patrocinium [Protection] B.M.V." (1739). <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> desired (1744) to form one congregation out of these two, giving the new organization the name of the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Order of St. Basil and dividing it into the two provinces of <a href="09292a.htm">Lithuania</a> and Courland. After the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a> these religious took charge of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">colleges</a>. The overthrow of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> instituted by the Russians against the <a href="05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Greeks was very unfavorable to the growth of the congregation, and the number of these <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> greatly diminished. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, by his <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Singulare praesidium" of 12 May, 1881, <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> a reform of the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a> of Galicia. This reform began in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Dabromil; its members have gradually replaced the non-reformed in the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the region. They devote themselves, in connection with the <a href="05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to the various labors of the apostolate which the moral condition or the different races in this district demands.</p>

<h2 id="section5">Latin Basilians</h2>

<p>In the sixteenth century the <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of this order were in the last stages of decay. Urged by Cardinal Sirlet, <a href="07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> (1573) their union in a congregation under the control of a superior general. Use was made of the opportunity to separate the revenues of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> from those of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The houses of the <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a> were divided into the three provinces of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, Calabria, and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Although the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> remained faithful in principle to the Greek Liturgy they showed an inclination towards the use of the Latin Liturgy; some <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> have adopted the latter altogether. In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> there was a <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian</a> congregation which had no traditional connection with Oriental <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a>; the members followed the Latin Liturgy. Father Bernardo de la Cruz and the <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> of Santa Maria de Oviedo in the Diocese of Ja&eacute;n formed the nucleus of the congregation. <a href="12131a.htm">Pope Pius VI</a> added them to the followers of St. Basil and they were affiliated with the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="07040b.htm">Grottaferrata</a> (1561). The <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Turdon and of Valle de Guillos, founded by Father Mateo de la Fuente, were for a time united with this congregation but they withdrew later in order to form a separate congregation (1603) which increased very little, having only four <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and a hospice at Seville. The other <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a>, who followed a less rigorous observance, showed more growth; their <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were formed into the two provinces of <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a> and Andalusia. They were governed by a <a href="15402a.htm">vicar general</a> and were under the control, at least nominally, of a superior general of the order. Each of their provinces had its college or scholasticate at Salamanca and Seville. They did not abstain from wine. Like their brethren in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> they wore a cowl similar to that of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>; this led to recriminations and processes, but they were authorized by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to continue the use of this attire. Several writers are to be found among them, as: Alfonso Clavel, the historiographer of the order; Diego Niceno, who has left sermons and ascetic writings; Luis de los Angelos, who issued a work on, "Instructions for Novices" (Seville, 1615), and also translated into Spanish <a href="02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion's</a> exposition of the Rule of St. Basil; Felipe de la Cruz. who wrote a treatise on money loaned at interest, that was published at <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1637, and one on <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>, published at <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 1634. The <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a> were suppressed with the other orders in 1833 and have not been re-established. At Annonay in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> community of men was formed (1822) under the Rule of St. Basil, which has a branch at <a href="14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a> (See <a href="02324a.htm">BASILIANS</a>, PRIESTS OF THE COMMUNITY OF ST. BASIL.)</p>
