<p>(TAO-KIAO.)</p>

<p>Taoism is the second of the three state <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> (<em>San-kiao</em>) of China.</p>

<p>This religion is derived from the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> doctrines of Lao-tze. "Lao-tze's Taoism", says Legge (Religions of <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, 229), "is the exhibition of a way or method of living which <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> should cultivate as the highest and purest development of their <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>". According to De Groot (Religious System of <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, IV, p. 66): "Taoism, as the word indicates, is the Religion of the Tao, a term meaning Path or Way, but denoting in this peculiar case the way, course or movement of the Universe, her processes and methods. In other words, Taoism is the Religion of <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and Earth, of the Cosmos, of the World or Nature in the broadest sense of these words. Hence we may call it <a href="10717a.htm">Naturism</a>".</p>

<p>Lao-tze, the equivalent to "the Old or Venerable Philosopher" (if taken as a title of respect), or to "Old Boy" (if literally translated), was born in the third year of Ting Wang, Prince of Chou, i.e. in 604 B.C., at K'io-jin, in the Kingdom of Ts'u, today Ho-nan Province. The legend given by Ko Hung in his "Record of Spirits and Immortals" (written in the fourth century A.D.), says that "he was not born till his mother had carried him in her womb seventy-two years or, according to some accounts, eighty-one years". "No wonder", adds Legge (1. c., pp. 203-4) "that the child should have had white hair, &mdash; an 'old boy' of about fourscore years!" This <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of 604 B.C., in accordance with historical tradition, is not given by Sze-ma Ts'ien in the biography which he devoted to the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in his "She-ki" (Historical Memoirs); if this date be accepted, it is difficult to admit of the <a href="02137a.htm">authenticity</a> of the meeting between Lao-tze and <a href="04223b.htm">Confucius</a>, 500 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>; if the latter was then fifty-one years old according to Chwang-tze, Lao-tze was then one hundred and four years old.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The family name of Lao-tze was Li, his name Eul (meaning "Ear"), his honorary title Pe-yang, and his posthumous name Tan (meaning "Flat-eared"). He was one of the "Sze", recorders, historiographers, keepers of the archives of Lo, the Court of the princes of the Chou dynasty. Foreseeing the decay of this dynasty, he gave up his office, and undertook a journey; at the Han-kou Pass, Ho-nan Province, the watchman, Yin Hi, begged him to write his thoughts for his own instruction before he retired from the world; consequently, Lao-tze wrote his work in two parts in the Tao and the Te, and having entrusted it to Yin Hi, he disappeared; the <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> of the death of the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> is not <a href="08673a.htm">known</a>. Lao-tze had a son Called Tsung who was a general of the Kingdom of Wei and who obtained the grant of land at Twan-kan. His son named Chu had himself a child Kung; Hia, grandson of Kung, was an official under Emperor Hiao-wen-ti, of the Han dynasty. Kiai, son of Hia, became a minister of K'iang, King of Kiao-si, and, owing to this circumstance, settled with his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> in the Kingdom of Ts'i.</p>

<p>This story is too matter of fact and lacks the marvellous legend which should surround the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of the chief of a new religion. Legend was provided for. Ko Hung, already mentioned, had placed the legend of Lao-tze at the beginning of the "Shon-sion-ch'-wan" (Records of Spirits and Immortals), and he says: "His mother carried him after the emotion she felt in seeing a large shooting star. He received from <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a> the vital breath; as he was born in a house whose proprietor was called Li (Pear tree), so he was named Li". Some authors say that Lao-tze was born before <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth. According to others, he possessed a pure <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> emanated from <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, He belonged to the Class of spirits and gods.</p>

<p>The chief work of Lao-tze, in fact the only one which has been ascribed to him with some probability, is the "Tao-teh-king". In the "China Review" (March-April, 1886), Dr. Herbert A. Giles wrote a sensational article, "The Remains of Lao Tzu", to show by various arguments that the "Tao-teh-king" is a spurious work and that its now spurious portions have been mostly mistranslated. It was the starting-point of a controversy in which Dr. Chalmers, Dr. Legge, Dr. Edkins, and some other sinologues took part. The authenticity of the work has been admitted by most of them. Wylie says (Notes on Chinese Literature, new ed., p. 216): "The only work which is known to be truly the production of Lao Keun is the 'Ta&ograve;u tih king', which has maintained its reputation and secured a popularity to a certain extent among reading men generally of every denomination." Legge writes (Religions of <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, p. 203): "No other writing has come down to us from the pencil of L&acirc;o-tsze, its author", and (Brit. Quart. Rev., July, 1883, p. 9): "We know that Lao Tzu wrote the 'Tao T&ecirc; Ching'", and (p. 11): "The 'Tao T&ecirc; Ching' is a genuine relic of one of the most original minds of the Chinese race, putting his thoughts on record 2400 years ago." The German E. Faber (China Rev., XIII, 241) says that "there is little room left for <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> regarding the authenticity of our Canon."</p>

<p>Besides the "Tao-teh-king" a good many works treat of Taoism: the "Yin-fu-king-kiai" which professes to be an exposition of the oldest Taoist record in existence; "Ts'ing-tsing-king" (The Book of Purity and Rest); the "T'ai-hsi-king" (Respiration of the Embryo); the "T'ai-shang-Kan-ying-pien" (Tractate of Actions and their Retributions).</p>

<p>The chief Taoist <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are: Tsou-yuen (400 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), author of a work on the influences of the five ruling elements, influenced by <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> doctrines; Kweiku-tze (380 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), a mystic, <a href="02018e.htm">astrologer</a>, and fortune-teller; Ho-kwan-tze (325-298 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), an <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="04223b.htm">Confucianist</a> when writing on <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, a Taoist in other writings; Chwang-tze (330 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), the author of the "Nan-hua" classic, the adversary to <a href="10179a.htm">Mencius</a>, and according to Eitel "the most original thinker <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> ever produced"; Shi-tze (280 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), a Taoist writer, influenced by the heterodox <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Yang-chu (450 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), the Apostle of Selfishness; the statesman Han-feitze (250 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>); Liu-ngan or Hwai-nan-tze (died 112 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), a <a href="04405c.htm">cosmogonist</a>. But the first disciples of Lao-tze were Kang-sang-tze (570-543 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), the first expositor of Taoism as a distinct system, the sceptic Li-tze (500 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), and Wen-tze (500 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>). The historian Sze-ma-ts'ien speaking of Chwang-tze says: "He wrote with a view to asperse the <a href="04223b.htm">Confucian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> and to glorify the mysteries of Lao Tze. . . His teachings are like an overwhelming flood, which spreads at its own sweet will. Consequently, from rulers and <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> downwards, none could apply them to any definite use." Giles (Chinese Literature, 60) concludes from this passage: "Here we have the key to the triumph of the <a href="04223b.htm">Tao of Confucius</a> over the Tao of Lao Tze. The latter was idealistic, the former a practical system for every-day use."</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As De Groot observes (l. s. c., IV, 67): "Taoism being fundamentally a religion of the Cosmos and its subdivisions, old <a href="03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="04405c.htm">Cosmogony</a> is its Theogony. It conceives the Universe as one large organism of powers and influences, a living machine, the core of which is the Great Ultimate Principle or <em>T'ai-kih</em>, comprising the two cosmic Breaths or Souls, known as the <em>Yang</em> and the <em>Yin</em>, of which, respectively, <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and Earth are the chief depositories. These two <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> produce the four seasons, and the phenomena of Nature represented by the lineal figures called <em>kwa</em>". In fact the <em>Yang</em> and the <em>Yin</em> produce by the power of their co-operation all that exists, man included. Ancient Chinese philosophy attributes to man two <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>The <em>shen</em>, or immaterial <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, emanates from the ethereal, celestial part of the Cosmos, and consists of <em>yang</em> substance. When operating actively in the living human body, it is called <em>k'i</em> or 'breath', and <em>kwun</em>; when separated from it after death, it lives as a refulgent spirit, styled <em>ming</em>.</li><li>The <em>kwei</em>, the material, substantial <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, emanates from the terrestrial part of the Universe, and is formed of <em>yin</em> substance. In living man it operates under the name of <em>p'oh</em> and on his death it returns to the Earth" (De Groot, IV, p. 5).</li></ol></div>

<p>Thus the <em>kwei</em> is buried with the man and the <em>shen</em> lingers about the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a>. Marking the distinction between the two <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, there existed in the legendary period, according to the "Li-ki", a sacrificial worship to each <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> separately: the <em>hwun</em> or <em>k'i</em> returns to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the <em>p'oh</em> returns to earth. These two <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> are composite; in fact all the viscera have a particular <em>shen</em>. "There are medical authors who ascribe to man an indefinite number of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> or soul-parts, or, as they express. it, a hundred <em>shen</em>. Those <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, they say, shift in the body according to the age of the owner; so, e.g. when he is 25, 31, 68 or 74, and older they dwell in his forehead, so that it is then very dangerous to have boils or ulcers there, because effusion of the blood would entail death. At other times of life they nestle under the feet or in other parts and limbs, and only in the 21st, 38th, 41st, and 50th years of life they are distributed equally through the body, so that open abscesses, wherever they appear, do not heal then at all. Such pathologic nonsense regulates, of course, medical practice to a high degree" (De Groot, IV, p. 75). The liver, the lungs, and the kidneys correspond to the spring, to the autumn, to the winter, as well as to the east, the west, and the north. The <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> may be extracted from a living man; the body may still live when left by the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, for instance during sleep; the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of a dead man may be reborn into other bodies. Ghosts may enter into relation with the living, not only in dreams, but they may take revenge on their enemies.</p>

<p>At the head of the Taoist Pantheon is a trinity of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li><em>Yuen-shi-t'ien-tsun</em>, "the honoured one of heaven, first in time", residing in "the jade-stone region", who created the three worlds;</li><li><em>Ling-pan-t'ien-tsun</em>, "the honored one of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> who is valued and powerful", residing in the "upper pure region", collector of the sacred books, calculator of the succession of time, and the regulator of the two principles <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>;</li><li>Lao-tze himself, who exposed to <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> the doctrines uttered by the first <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> in the trinity and collected in the form of books by the second.</li></ol></div>

<p>Next come: <em>Yuh-hwang-ta-ti</em>, "the great jade-stone emperor", who governs the physical <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>; <em>Hen-t'u-hwang-ti-k'i</em>, "Spirit of imperial earth, ruler of the soil"; the star gods, whose lord (<em>sing-chu</em>) resides in a star near the pole; <em>T'ien-hwang-ta-ti</em>, who lives in the pole star, etc.; <em>Liu-tsu</em>, the "father of thunder". "While he discourses on <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, his foot rests on nine beautiful birds. He has under him thirty-six generals, <em>t'ien tsiang</em>" (Edkins, "Journ. North <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> Br. Roy. Asiat. Soc.," III, Dec., 1859, p. 311); the sun and moon; the <em>San-yuen</em> or <em>San-kwan</em>, "the three rulers" who preside over three departments of physical nature, <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, earth, and water; <em>Hiuen-kien-shang-ti</em>, "high emperor of the dark heaven", who is described as the model of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> ascetic. He has transformed himself eighty-two times to become the instructor of men in the three national <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> (Edkins, l. c., p. 312). A number of personages were worshipped under the name of <em>tsu</em>, <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. <a href="04223b.htm">Confucius</a> himself has a place assigned him among the <a href="04683a.htm">deities</a> of this religion, and he is addressed as "the <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> one of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> who causes literature to flourish and the world to prosper" (Edkins). Some men have been worshipped as gods after their death: Kwan-ti, the god of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>; Hu-tsu, a physician; a medical divinity, Ko-tsu Sa-tsu ; etc.</p>

<p>One may well ask how the pure abstract <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Lao-tze was turned into a medley of <a href="01272b.htm">alchemical</a> researches, a practice of <a href="15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>, with the addition of <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, which constitute today what is called <em>Tao-kiao</em>, the religion or the teaching of Tao. This was the work of a legendary being, Chang Tao-ling, a descendant of the eighth generation of Chang Leang, a celebrated advisor of Liu-pang, founder of the Han dynasty. He was born in the tenth year of the Emperor Kwang Wu-ti (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 34) in a cottage of a small village of the Che-kiang Province, at the foot of the T'ien-mu-Shan, in the Hang-chou Prefecture. At an early age Chang studied the works of Lao-tze to which he added researches of <a href="01272b.htm">alchemy</a>, a <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> aiming at "prolonging life beyond the limits assigned by nature". He found the drug of <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and by order of Lao-tze he destroyed the six great <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a> of the province; Lao-tze gave him also two books, two swords, one male, one <a href="15687b.htm">female</a>, a seal Called <em>Tu-kung</em>, etc. Chang gave his swords and books to his son Heng, bidding him to continue his pontificate from generation to generation. At noon on the seventh day of the first moon of the second year Yung-shou of the Han Emperor Heng (<font size=-2>A.D.</font> 157), Tao-ling ascended the Cloudy Mountain (<em>Yun-shan</em>) with his wife and two disciples, and with them disappeared into <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Chang Heng, son of Chang Tao-ling, continued his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> tradition both in spiritual and <a href="01272b.htm">alchemical</a> researches, and Chang Lu the grandson, played an important part in the Yellow Cap Rebellion at the beginning of the Han dynasty. During the fifth century <font size=-2>A.D.</font>, when the Wei dynasty was ruling in Northern <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, a certain K'iu Kien-che tried to substitute himself to the Chang <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and received in 423 from the emperor the title of <em>T'ien-shi</em>, "Preceptor of Heaven", which formerly belonged to Tao-ling. In 748 the T'ang Emperor Hiuen-Tsung conferred this title upon the heirs of the latter, and a grant of a large <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> near Lung-hu Shan was made to them in 1016 by the Sung Emperor Chen-Tsung. Heredity in the charge of <a href="12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the cult was secured to the descendants of Chang by the transmigration of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of Tao-ling's successor, at the time of his demise, to the body of a junior member of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, whose selection is indicated by a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> phenomenon.</p>

<p>Today, at the head of the Taoist <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is the <em>Cheng-i-sze-kiao-chen-jen</em>, "Heir to the founder of the Taoist <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>"; this title was conferred by the Ming dynasty upon Chang Cheng-shang, descendant from Chang Tao-ling of the thirty-ninth generation. This title "belongs, by an hereditary privilege, to the <a href="06081a.htm">firstborn</a> descending in a direct line from Chang Tao-ling. He lives upon the Lung-hu Mountain, in the Kiang-si Province. His office consists in using his magical art to frighten <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a> away, to baffle diabolical influence, and to refrain the evil-doing <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead. He names the new <em>Ch'eng-hwang</em>, 'tutelary <a href="04683a.htm">deities</a> of the cities', and for a fee, he gives to Taoists titles permitting them to celebrate the ceremonies with more solemnity" (P. Hoang, "M&eacute;langes sur l'Administration", 34). In the capital of the empire the Taoist <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> includes: <em>two Tao-lu-sze</em>, superiors, a title corresponding with that of the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhists</a>, <em>seng-lu-sze</em>; two <em>Cheng-i</em>, Taoists of right simplicity; two <em>Yen-fa</em>, ritual Taoists; two <em>Che-ling</em>, Taoists of great excellence, thaumaturgus; and two <em>Che-i</em>, Taoists of great probity, an inferior class of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. In the provinces at the head of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> are: <em>Tao-ki-sze Ton-ki</em>, superior of the Taoists of a <em>fu</em> (prefectute), and <em>Tao-ki-sze Fou Ton-ki</em>, vice-superior of the Taoists of a <em>fu</em>; <em>Tao-cheng</em>, superior of the Taoists of a <em>chou</em> or a <em>t'ing; Tao-hwei</em>, superior of the Taoists of a <em>hien</em>. The superiors are appointed by the governors-general (<em>tsung-tu</em>), or by the governors (<em>fu-t'ai</em>), on the presentation of the prefect of sub-prefect of the <em>chou, t'ing</em>, or <em>hien</em>.</p>
