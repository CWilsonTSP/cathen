<p>Born at Xanten on the left bank of the Rhine, near Wesel, c. 1080; died at <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, 6 June, 1134. His father, Heribert, Count of Gennep, was related to the imperial house of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and his house of <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>. A stately bearing, a penetrating <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, a tender, earnest heart, marked the future apostle. <a href="11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, Norbert was appointed to a <a href="03252a.htm">canonry</a> at Xanten. Soon after he was summoned to the Court of Frederick, Prince-Bishop of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and later to that of Henry V, Emperor of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, whose almoner he became. The Bishopric of Cambray was offered to him, but refused. Norbert allowed himself to be so carried away by pleasure that nothing short of a <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a> of grace could make him lead the life of an earnest cleric. One day, while riding to Vreden, a village near Xanten, he was overtaken by a storm. A thunderbolt fell at his horse's feet; the frightened animal threw its rider, and for nearly an hour he lay like one dead. Thus humbled, Norbert became a sincere penitent. Renouncing his appointment at Court, he retired to Xanten to lead a life of penance.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Understanding, however, that he stood in need of guidance, he placed himself under the direction of Cono, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Siegburg. In gratitude to Cono, Norbert founded the Abbey of F&uuml;rstenberg, endowed it with a portion of his <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, and made it over to Cono and his <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> successors. Norbert was then in his thirty-fifth year. Feeling that he was called to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, he presented himself to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, from whose hands he received <a href="11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>. After a forty days' retreat at Siegburg Abbey, he celebrated his first Mass at Xanten and preached an earnest discourse on the transitory character of this world's pleasures and on man's <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> toward <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. The insults of some young <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, one of whom even spat in his face, he bore with wonderful patience on that occasion. Norbert often went to Siegburg Abbey to confer with Cono, or to the cell of Ludolph, a <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> and learned hermit-priest, or to the Abbey or Klosterrath near Rolduc. Accused as an innovator at the Council of Fritzlar, he resigned all his <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preferments, disposed of his estate, and gave all to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, reserving for himself only what was needed for the celebration of Holy Mass. Barefooted and begging his bread, he journeyed as far as <a href="06559a.htm">St. Giles</a>, in Languedoc, to confer with Pope Gelasius concerning his future life. Unable to keep Norbert at his court, Gelasius granted him faculties to preach wherever he judged proper. At Valenciennes Norbert met (March, 1119) Burchard, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cambray, whose <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> joined him in his apostolic journeys in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. After the death of Pope Gelasius (29 January, 1119) Norbert wished to confer with his successor, <a href="03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a>, at the Council of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> (Oct., 1119). The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and Bartholomew, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Laon, requested Norbert to found a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order in the Diocese of Laon, so that his work might be perpetuated after his death. Norbert chose a lonely, marshy valley, shaped in the form of a cross, in the Forest of Coucy, about ten miles from Laon, and named Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;. Hugh of Fosses, Evermode of Cambray, Antony of Nivelles, seven students of the celebrated <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of Anselm, and Ralph at Laon were his first disciples. The young community at first lived in huts of wood and clay, arranged like a camp around the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. John the Baptist, but they soon built a larger church and a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the religious who joined them in increasing numbers. Going to Cologne to obtain <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> for their church, Norbert discovered through a vision, the spot where those of <a href="15225d.htm">St. Ursula</a> and her companions, of St. Gereon, and of other <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> lay hidden.</p>

<p>Women also wished to become members of the new <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order. Blessed Ricwera, <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of Count Raymond of Clastres, was St. Norbert's first spiritual daughter, and her example was followed by <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> of the best <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Soon after this, Norbert returned to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and preached in <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, when Godfrey, Count of Kappenberg, offered himself and gave three of his castles to be made into <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. On his return from <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Norbert was met by Theobald, Count of Champagne, who wished to become a member of the order; but Norbert insisted that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> wished Theobald to marry and do good in the world. Theobald agreed to this, but begged Norbert to prescribe a rule of life. Norbert prescribed a few rules and invested Theobald with the white <a href="13508b.htm">scapular</a> of the order, and thus, in 1122, the <a href="14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Norbert was instituted. The saint was soon requested by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> to go and combat the <a href="08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> which Tanchelin had <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, and which had their centre at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. As a result of his preaching the people of the Low Countries <a href="01044d.htm">abjured</a> their <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and many brought back to him the Sacred Species which they had <a href="14564b.htm">stolen</a> and profaned. In commemoration of this, St. Norbert has been proclaimed the Apostle of <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, and the feast of his triumph over the Sacramentarian <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> is celebrated in the <a href="10104a.htm">Archdiocese of Mechlin</a> on 11 July.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The rapid growth of the order was marvellous, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> entreated Norbert to found new houses in their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Floreffe, <a href="15493a.htm">Viviers</a>, St-Josse, Ardenne, Cuissy, Laon, Li&#232;ge, <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, Varlar, Kappenberg and others were founded during the first five years of the order's existence. Though the order had already been approved by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a>, Norbert, accompanied by three disciples, journeyed to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1125, to obtain its confirmation by the new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, Honorius II. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Confirmation is <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 February, 1126. Passing through <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> on his return to Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;, Norbert restored sight to a blind <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>; the inhabitants were so full of admiration for him that they spoke of electing him successor to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> who had just died, but Norbert and his companions fled secretly. Soon after this, on his way to <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, he passed through Spier, where Lothair, King of the Romans, was holding a diet, the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> being present. Deputies form Magdeburg had also come to solicit a successor to their late <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Rudger.</p>

<p>The <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> and Lothair used their authority, and <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> Norbert to accept the vacant see. On taking possession of it, he was grieved to find that much <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> belonging to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the poor had been usurped by powerful men, and that many of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> led <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> lives. He succeeded in converting some of the transgressors, but others only became more obstinate, and three attempts were made on his life. He resisted Pietro di Leoni, who, as <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, had assumed the name of Anacletus and was master in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, exerting himself at the Council of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> to attach the German Emperor and the German <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and princes more firmly to the cause of <a href="08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a>.</p>

<p>Though his health was increasingly delicate, Norbert accompanied Lothair and his army to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to put the rightful <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> on the Chair of St. Peter, and he resisted the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> concession of the investiture to the emperor. Norbert, whose health was now much impaired, accompanied the Emperor Lothair back to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and for some time remained with him, assisting him as his chancellor and adviser. In March, 1134, Norbert had become so feeble that he had to be carried to Magdeburg where he died on the Wednesday after Pentecost. By order of the emperor, his body was laid at rest in the <a href="12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of St. Mary, at <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. His <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> became glorious by the numerous <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought there. The <a href="02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> say that there is no document to prove that he was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. His <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> was by <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> in 1582, and his cultus was executed to the whole church by <a href="04028b.htm">Clement X</a>.</p>

<p>On 2 May, 1627, the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> body was translated from <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, then in the hands of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, to the Abbey of Strahov, a suburb of Prague in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The Chancery of Prague preserved the <a href="01044d.htm">abjurations</a> of six hundred <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who, on the day, or during the octave, of the translation, were reconciled to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. On that occasion the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12338a.htm">Prague</a>, at the request of the civil and <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, proclaimed St. Norbert the Patron and Protector of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. (For history of the order, see <a href="12387b.htm">PREMONSTRATENSIAN CANONS</a>.)</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">Until the middle of the last century, the principal source for the biography of St. Norbert was a MS. usually attributed to HUGO, the saint's first disciple and successor, of which numerous copies had been made. That belonging to the Abbey of Romersdorf, near Coblentz, <em>Vita Norberti, auctore canonico pr&#230;adjuvante Hugone abbate, Fossense</em> is now in the British Museum. An abridgment of this by SURIUS was printed in 1572; the whole MS., with variants, was published by ABBOT VANDER STERRE in 1656; again, with commentaries and notes, by PAPEBROCHI in <em>Acta SS.,</em> XX. Then followed: VANDER STERRE, <em>Het leven van den H. Norbertus</em> (Antwerp, 1623); DU PR&#201;, <em>La Vie de S. Norbert</em> (Paris, 1627); CAMUS, <em>L'Homme apostolique en S. Norbert</em> (Caen, 1640); C. L. HUGO, <em>La Vie de S. Norbert</em> (Luxemburg, 1704); ILLANA, <em>Historia del Gran Padre y Patriarca S. Norberto</em> (Salamanca, 1755).</p><p class="cenotes">In 1856, a MS. <em>Life of St. Norbert</em> discovered in the Royal Library, Berlin, was published in PERTZ, <em>Mon. Germ. Hist.</em>, differing in many particulars from the HUGO MSS. mentioned above. The discovery occasioned a great revival of interest in the subject, and there followed: TENKOFF, <em>De S. Norberto Ord. Pr&#230;m. Conditore commentatio historica</em> (M&#252;nster, 1855); SCHOLZ, <em>Vita S. Norberti</em> (Breslau, 1859); WINTER, <em>Die Pr&#228;monstratenser der 12. Jahrh.</em> Berlin, 1865); ROSENMUND, <em>Die &#228;ltesten Biographien des h. Norbertus</em> (Berlin, 1874); HERTEL, <em>Leben des h. Norbert</em> (Leipzig, 1881). M&#220;HLBACHER, <em>Die streitige Papstwahl des Jahres 1130</em> (Innsbruck, 1876).
