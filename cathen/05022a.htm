<p>(Or <em>diptychon</em>, Greek <em>diptychon</em> from <em>dis</em>, twice and <em>ptyssein</em>, to fold).</p>

<p>A diptych is a sort of notebook, formed by the union of two tablets, placed one upon the other and united by rings or by a hinge. These tablets were made of wood, <a href="08257b.htm">ivory</a>, bone. or metal. Their inner surfaces had ordinarily a raised frame and were covered with wax, upon which characters were scratched by means of a stylus. Diptychs were known among the Greeks from the sixth century before Christ. They served as copy-books for the exercise of penmanship, for correspondence, and various other uses. The Roman military certificates, <em>privilegia militum</em>, were a kind of diptych. Between the two tablets others were sometimes inserted and the diptych would then be called a triptych, polyptych, etc. The term diptych is often restricted to a highly ornamented type of notebooks. They were generally made out of <a href="08257b.htm">ivory</a> with carved work, and were sometimes from twelve to sixteen inches in height. In the fourth and fifth centuries a distinction arose between profane and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> (liturgical) diptychs, the former being frequently given as presents by high-placed <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. It was customary to commemorate in this way one's elevation to a public office, or any event of personal importance, e.g. a marriage. The consuls, on the day of the installation, were wont to offer diptychs to their friends and even to the emperor. Those presented to the latter often had a border of gold and were quite large. Their tablets often exhibited on a central plate the portrait of the sovereign, surrounded by four other plates. The (undated) Barberini <a href="08257b.htm">ivory</a> at the Louvre is thus constructed and once served as an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> diptych (see below). Some believe it to be the binding of a books offered to the emperor. Strzygowski holds it to be of <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin and thinks that the portrait is that of <a href="04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, defender of the Faith. The oldest dated consular diptych is that of Probus (406); it is kept in the treasury of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="01591c.htm">Aosta</a>, <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>. The latest is that of the Eastern consul, Basilius (541), one tablet of which is at the Uffizi Museum in <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a> and the other at the Brera in <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The Theodosian Code (384) forbade the offering of <a href="08257b.htm">ivory</a> diptychs to any but the regular (i.e. not honorary) consuls. The tablet at the Mayer Museum in <a href="09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, bearing the image of <a href="02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> (d. 180), is prior to this enactment. The consular diptychs are recognizable by their inscriptions or by the figure of the consul which they bear. On the diptych of Boetius at <a href="02760a.htm">Brescia</a> (487) and several others of the same type the consul is clad in a <em>trabea</em> (a kind of toga); he holds in his left hand the <em>scipio</em> (consular sceptre) and in his right the <em>mappa circensis</em>, or white cloth which he used to wave as the signal for the games in the circus. These games (<em>ludi</em>) or other liberalities offered to the people by the consul were frequently represented on the tablets of the diptychs.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>There is less <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> concerning the diptychs of officials other than consuls, e.g. praetors, quaestors, etc. The diptych of Rufius Probianus V.C. (i.e. <em>vir clarissimus</em>) <em>vicarius urbis Romae</em>, in the Berlin Museum, is the most precious relic of this class, and probably dates from the end of the fourth century. Among the diptychs of private <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> that of Gallienus Concessus, discovered at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the Esquiline, exhibits only the name of its owner. Others were richly ornamented and reproduced often some of the masterpieces of ancient art. Thus on a diptych in the Mayer Museum, <a href="09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, are seen Aesculapius and Telesphorus Hygieia, and Amor. The most beautiful of the profane diptychs was carved at the time of a marriage between the Symmachi and the Nicomachi (392 to 394, or 401). It represents on each leaf (one of which is at the South Kensington Museum and the other, in a very damaged condition, at Cluny) a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> performing a sacrifice. Many of the profane diptychs were preserved in the treasuries of the churches, where they were eventually used for <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> purposes or enshrined in bookbindings or in goldsmith work. The diptych of Boetius, among others bears on the interior, some <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> texts and <a href="11395a.htm">religious paintings</a>, attributed to the seventh century. The <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> diptych of the consul Anastasius (517), one leaf of which is at <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and the other at South Kensington, bears an inscription of forty-two lines and the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> <em>Communicantes</em> from the Canon of the Mass. Another of the same consul (in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>) has a list of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. At the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Monza, <a href="09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, a diptych represents in the dress of consuls <a href="04642b.htm">King David</a> and <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>. It is perhaps an ancient consular diptych, transformed in the eighth or ninth century; according to some it appears to be of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> origin. Many carved diptychs reproduced purely religious subjects. On a diptych in the treasury of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the figure of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is exactly the same as that on a sarcophagus in <a href="06395b.htm">Gaul</a>. A diptych leaf in the treasury of Tongres was evidently influenced by the carvings on the <em>cathedra</em> of <a href="10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a> at <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and seems to have belonged to an ancient <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. Certain diptychs with religious subjects, e.g. the Holy Sepulchre and the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> at the Tomb of Christ (Milan), an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> (British Museum), probably date from the fourth or fifth century. Diptych leaves divided into five compartments have generally served as a cover for copies of the Gospels. The diptychs, though often clumsily executed, are important for the history of <a href="13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, there being a good number of them extant, and several being accurately dated. At different periods in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> numerous diptychs or triptychs of <a href="08257b.htm">ivory</a> were made, to serve as little devotional panels.</p>

<p>The <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use of diptychs offers considerable interest. In the early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> ages it was customary to write on diptychs the names of those, living or dead, who were considered as members of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> a signal evidence of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">Communion of Saints</a>. Hence the terms "diptychs of the living" and "diptychs of the dead." Such <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> diptychs varied in shape and dimension. Their use (<em>sacrae tabulae, <a href="10052a.htm">matriculae</a>, libri vivorum et mortuorum</em>) is attested in the writings of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (third century) and by the history of <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (fourth century), nor did they disappear from the churches until the twelfth century in the West and the fourteenth century in the East. In the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life of antiquity these <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> diptychs served various purposes. It is probable that the names of the <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> were written on diptychs, which were thus a kind of <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> register. The "diptychs of the living" would include the names of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and illustrious <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, both lay and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, of the benefactors of a church, and of those who offered the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. To these names were sometimes added those of the Blessed Virgin, of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and of other <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. From such diptychs came the first <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="03158a.htm">calendars</a> and the <a href="09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>. The "diptychs of the dead" would include the names of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> otherwise qualified for inscription on the diptychs of the living, e.g. the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the community (also other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>), moreover <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> who had died in the odour of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. It is to this kind of diptychs that the later necrologies owe their origin. Occasionally special diptychs were made to contain only the names of a series of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; in this way arose at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> the episcopal lists or catalogues of occupants of <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>. Whatever their immediate purpose the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> diptychs admitted only the names of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> in communion with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; the names of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> and of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> members were never inserted. Exclusion from these lists was a grave <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalty; the highest dignity, episcopal or imperial, would not avail to save the offender from its infliction. The content of the diptychs was read out, either from the <a href="01381e.htm">ambo</a> or from the altar by a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>. In this respect a variety of customs obtained in different churches and at different periods, sometimes the diptychs were simply laid on the altar during Mass, and when read publicly, such reading did not always occur at the same stage of the Mass. The order of which traces are now seen in the Roman Canon of the Mass was the fixed usage of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> as early as the fifth century. In that venerable document a long passage after the Sanctus corresponding to the ancient recitation of the diptychs of the living; it contains, as is well known, mention of those for whom the Mass is offered, of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, of the Blessed Virgin, and of several <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. At <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and at Pentecost the <em>Hanc igitur</em> furnished a proper occasion to mention the names of the newly <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a>, now mentioned only as a body. Finally the recitation of the "diptychs of the dead" is still recalled by the Memento which for the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>.</p>
