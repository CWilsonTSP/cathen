<p>Date of birth unknown; died 12 March, 417. Before his elevation to the Chair of Peter, very little is known concerning the life of this energetic <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, so <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the welfare of the whole Church. According to the <a href="09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> he was a native of <a href="01255b.htm">Albano</a>; his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> was called Innocentius. He grew up among the Roman <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and in the service of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. After the death of Anastasius (Dec., 401) he was unanimously chosen <a href="12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. Not much has come down to us concerning his <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> activities in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Nevertheless one or two instances of his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the purity of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> and for church discipline are well attested. He took several churches in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the <a href="11138a.htm">Novatians</a> (<a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26017.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.2</a>) and caused the <a href="12043a.htm">Photinian</a> Marcus to be banished from the city. A drastic <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, which the <a href="07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> issued from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (22 Feb., 407) against the <a href="09591a.htm">Manicheans</a>, the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, and the Priscillianists (Codex Theodosianus, XVI, 5, 40), was very probably not issued without his concurrence. Through the munificence of Vestina, a rich Roman matron, Innocent was enabled to build and richly endow a church dedicated to <a href="06537a.htm">Sts. Gervasius and Protasius</a>; this was the <em>old Titulus Vestin&aelig;</em> which still stands under the name of San Vitale. The siege and capture of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> under Alaric (408-10) occurred in his pontificate. When, at the time of the first siege, the barbarian leader had declared that he would withdraw only on condition that the Romans should arrange a peace favourable to him, an embassy of the Romans went to <a href="07460a.htm">Honorius</a>, at <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, to try, if possible, to make peace between him and the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a>. Pope Innocent also joined this embassy. But all his endeavours to bring about peace failed. The <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a> then recommenced the siege of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the envoys were not able to return to the city, which was taken and sacked in 410. From the beginning of his pontificate, Innocent often acted as head of the whole Church, both East and West.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In his letter to Archbishop Anysius of <a href="14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, in which he informed the latter of his own election to the <a href="07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>, he also confirmed the privileges which had been bestowed upon the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> by previous <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. When Eastern <a href="07663a.htm">Illyria</a> fell to the Eastern Empire (379) <a href="04613a.htm">Pope Damasus</a> had asserted and preserved the ancient <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> in those parts, and his successor Siricius had bestowed on the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> the privilege of confirming and consecrating the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Eastern <a href="07663a.htm">Illyria</a>. These prerogatives were renewed by Innocent (Ep. i), and by a later letter (Ep. xiii, 17 June, 412) the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> entrusted the supreme administration of the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Eastern <a href="07663a.htm">Illyria</a> to Archbishop Rufus of <a href="14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, as representative of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. By this means the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> vicariate of <a href="07663a.htm">Illyria</a> was put on a sound basis, and the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> became vicars of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. On 15 Feb., 404, Innocent sent an important <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a> to Bishop Victricius of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (Ep. ii), who had laid before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> a list of disciplinary matters for decision. The points at issue concerned the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, admissions into the ranks of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the disputes of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, whereby important matters (<em>caus&aelig; majores</em>) were to be brought from the episcopal tribunal to the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, also the ordinations of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, the reception of converted <a href="11138a.htm">Novatians</a> or <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. In general, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> indicated the discipline of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> as being the norm for the other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to follow. Innocent directed a similar <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a> to the <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (Ep. iii) among whom difficulties had arisen, especially regarding the Priscillianist <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> regulated this matter and at the same time settled other questions of <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>.</p>

<p>Similar letters, disciplinary in content, or decisions of important cases, were sent to Bishop Exuperius of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (Ep. vi), to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> (Ep. xvii), to Decentius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07055a.htm">Gubbio</a> (Ep. xxv), to Felix, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11086c.htm">Nocera</a> (Ep. xxxviii). Innocent also addressed shorter letters to several other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among them a letter to two British <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Maximus and Severus, in which he decided that those <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who, while <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, had begotten children should be dismissed from their sacred office (Ep. xxxix). Envoys were sent by the <a href="01199a.htm">Synod of Carthage</a> (404) to the <a href="12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, or the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city where the emperor was staying, in order to provide for severer treatment of the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a>. The envoys came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Pope Innocent obtained from the <a href="07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> a strong <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> against those African sectaries, by which many adherents of <a href="10521a.htm">Montanism</a> were induced to be reconciled with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="03096a.htm">Christian East</a> also claimed a share of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> energy. <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, who was <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the Empress Eudoxia and the Alexandrian patriarch Theophilus, threw himself on the protection of Innocent. Theophilus had already informed the latter of the deposition of John, following on the illegal Synod of the Oak (<em>ad quercum</em>). But the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> did not recognize the sentence of the synod, summoned Theophilus to a new synod at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, consoled the exiled <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Byzantium, and wrote a letter to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of Constantinople in which he animadverted severely on their conduct towards their <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (John), and announced his intention of calling a general synod, at which the matter would be sifted and decided. Thessalonica was suggested as the place of assembly. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> informed <a href="07460a.htm">Honorius, Emperor of the West</a>, of these proceedings, whereupon the latter wrote three letters to his brother, the Eastern Emperor Arcadius, and besought Arcadius to summon the Eastern <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to a synod at <a href="14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, before which the Patriarch Theophilus was to appear. The messengers who brought these three letters were ill received, Arcadius being quite favourable to Theophilus. In spite of the efforts of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Western emperor, the synod never took place. Innocent remained in correspondence with the exiled John; when, from his place of banishment the latter thanked him for his kind solicitude, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> answered with another comforting letter, which the exiled <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> received only a short time before his death (407) (Epp. xi, xii). The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> did not recognize Arsacius and Atticus, who had been raised to the <a href="04301a.htm">See of Constantinople</a> instead of the unlawfully deposed John.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>After John's death, Innocent desired that the name of the deceased patriarch should be restored to the <a href="05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, but it was not until after Theophilus was dead (412) that Atticus yielded. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> obtained from many other Eastern <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> a similar recognition of the wrong done to <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. The <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, dating from the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> conflicts, was finally settled in Innocent's time. Alexander, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, succeeded, about 413-15, in gaining over to his cause the adherents of the former Bishop Eustathius; he also received into the ranks of his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> the followers of Paulinus, who had fled to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and had been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> there. Innocent informed Alexander of these proceedings, and as Alexander restored the name of John Chrysostom to the <a href="05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> entered into communion with the Antiochene patriarch, and wrote him two letters, one in the name of a Roman synod of twenty <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and one in his own name (Epp. xix and xx). Acacius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ber&aelig;a, one of the most <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> opponents of Chrysostom, had sought to obtain re-admittance to communion with the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> through the aforesaid Alexander of Antioch. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> informed him, though Alexander, of the conditions under which he would resume communion with him (Ep. xxi). In a later letter Innocent decided several questions of church discipline (Ep. xxiv).</p>

<p>The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> also informed the Macedonian <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> Maximian and the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Bonifatius, who had interceded with him for the recognition of Atticus, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, of the conditions, which were similar to those required of the above-mentioned <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (Epp. xxii and xxiii). In the <a href="11306b.htm">Origenist</a> and <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> controversies, also, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority was invoked from several quarters. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Bethlehem were attacked in their <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> by brutal followers of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> was killed, and a part of the buildings was set on fire. John, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who was on bad terms with Jerome, owing to the <a href="11306b.htm">Origenist</a> controversy, did nothing to prevent these outrages. Through Aurelius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Innocent sent <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> a letter of condolence, in which he informed him that he would employ the influence of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to repress such crimes; and if Jerome would give the names of the guilty ones, he would proceed further in the matter. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at once wrote an earnest letter of exhortation to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and reproached him with negligence of his pastoral <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was also compelled to take part in the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> controversy. In 415, on the proposal of Orosius, the Synod of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> brought the matter of the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> before the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The synod of Eastern <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> held at Diospolis (Dec., 415), which had been deceived by <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> with regard to his actual teaching and had acquitted him, approached Innocent on behalf of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>. On the report of Orosius concerning the proceedings at Diospolis, the African <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled in synod at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in 416, and confirmed the condemnation which had been pronounced in 411 against C&aelig;lestius, who shared the views of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Numidia did likewise in the same year in the Synod of <a href="10304b.htm">Mileve</a>. Both <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> reported their transactions to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and asked him to confirm their decisions. Soon after this, five African <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among them <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, wrote a personal letter to Innocent regarding their own position in the matter of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. Innocent in his reply praised the African <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, because, mindful of the authority of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, they had appealed to the Chair of Peter; he rejected the teachings of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and confirmed the decisions drawn up by the African Synods (Epp. xxvii-xxxiii). The decisions of the Synod of Diospolis were rejected by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> now sent a confession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> to Innocent, which, however, was only delivered to his successor, for Innocent died before the document reached the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in a <a href="02325a.htm">basilica</a> above the <a href="03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Pontianus, and was <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. He was a very energetic and active man, and a highly gifted ruler, who fulfilled admirably the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office.</p>
