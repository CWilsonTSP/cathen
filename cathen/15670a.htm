<p><a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, first <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a>; b. at <a href="13744a.htm">Seville</a>, 2 Aug., 1802; d. in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, 15 Feb., 1865, younger son of James Wiseman, a merchant of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> resident in <a href="13744a.htm">Seville</a>, by his second wife, Xaviera Strange. On his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> death in 1805 he was taken to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> by his mother, and after two years at <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in Waterford was, with his brother, placed at <a href="15233b.htm">Ushaw College</a>, <a href="05211a.htm">Durham</a>, founded seventeen years previously, where the distinguished historian <a href="02084a.htm">John Lingard</a>, Wiseman's lifelong friend, was then vice-president. At <a href="15233b.htm">Ushaw</a> Nicholas resolved to embrace the life of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, and in 1818 he was chosen as one of the first batch of students for the English College in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which had just been revived after having been closed for twenty years owing to the French occupation. Soon after his arrival he was received in audience, with five other English students, by <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, who made them a kind and encouraging address; and his next six years were devoted to hard and regular study, under the strict discipline of the college. He attained distinction in the natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> as well as in dogmatic and <a href="13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>, and in July, 1824, took his degree of Doctor of Divinity, after successfully sustaining a public disputation before a great audience of learned men, including at least one future <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Eight months later, on 19 March, 1825, he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. His particular bent had always been towards Syriac and other Oriental studies, and this was encouraged by his superiors. The learning and research evidenced in his work, "Horae Syriacae", which appeared in 1827, established his <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a> as an oriental scholar. Already vice-rector of the English College, and thus enjoying an official status in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was named by <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, soon after the publication of his book, supernumerary professor of Hebrew and Syro-Chaldaic in the Sapienza University, and soon found himself in communication, by letter or otherwise, with all the great <a href="11302c.htm">Orientalists</a> of the day, such as Bunsen, <a href="13553a.htm">Scholz</a>, <a href="01105b.htm">Ackermann</a>, and Tholuck.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>By the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> wish he undertook at this time a course of English sermons for the benefit of English visitors to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in June, 1828, while still only in his twenty-sixth year, he became Rector of the English College. This position gave him the status of official representative of the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and brought many external <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> into his life, hitherto devoted chiefly to study, lecturing, and preaching. Noted as a linguist &#151; "he can speak with readiness and point", wrote <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> of him some years later, "in half-a-dozen languages, without being detected for a foreigner in any one of them" &#151; he received and entertained at the college distinguished visitors from every <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> country, and was equally popular with them all. Gladstone, <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a>, Hurrell Froude, Archbishop Trench, Macaulay, Monckton-Milnes, and <a href="09604b.htm">Manning</a> were among the eminent Englishmen who made his acquaintance during the twelve years of his rectorship; and he had much interesting intercourse also with <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>, then bent on his scheme of reconciling Democracy with Ultramontanism, and his devoted friends <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, <a href="10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, and Rio. <a href="14214b.htm">Fr. Ignatius Spencer</a>, afterwards the famous <a href="11521d.htm">Passionist</a>, who entered the English College in 1830, had much to do with the turning of Wiseman's thoughts towards the possible return of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity; and this was deepened by his conversations with <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> and Fronde when they visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1833. Meanwhile he was busy with the preparation of his lectures "On the Connection between Science and Revealed Religion", which were delivered in 1835, and greatly added to his <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a>, although they embodied some theories which have been superseded since. They won unstinted praise from such critics as Bunsen, Milnes, <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, Lepsius, and <a href="09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai</a>, and raised Wiseman to perhaps the highest point he was to attain as a student and a man of letters. His quiet life of study was indeed, though he hardly <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> it, now practically at an end; and the last thirty years of his career were destined to be largely taken up with an active participation in the events following on the general religious reaction in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, of which the <a href="11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> was one of the most remarkable fruits. Wiseman's correspondence at this time evinces his keen and ardent sympathy with the widespread religious revival associated with such names as those of <a href="11378a.htm">Ozanam</a> and <a href="08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, Schlegel and G&ouml;rres in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="09634a.htm">Manzoni</a> and others in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He was in constant correspondence with <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> (whom he brought into relations with <a href="09270c.htm">Lingard</a>), expressed unbounded admiration for his Church History, then being published, and hoped through him to establish co-operation between German and <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1835 Wiseman came to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> for a year's sojourn, full of fervent hopes for the future of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in that country. But he had never lived there himself under the numbing pressure of the <a href="11611c.htm">penal laws</a>; and it was a shock to him to realize that the long down-trodden "English papists", from whom that oppression had only recently been removed by the Emancipation Act of 1829, were not in the least ripe for any vigorous forward movement or prominent participation in public life. Nor was any particular encouragement in this direction given to them in the exhortations or pastoral letters of their <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors, whose chief anxiety seemed to be lest the <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> of their flocks might be adversely affected by their new-born liberty of action. Wiseman's enthusiasm, however, was not damped by the somewhat chilly atmosphere of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. He began without delay a course of lectures, addressed alike to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, which at once attracted large audiences, and from which, wrote a well-qualified critic, dated "the beginning of a serious revival of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>." The lectures were resumed in the following year, in the largest <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, with even greater success. Some distinguished converts &#151; among them the eminent architect <a href="12558b.htm">Welby Pugin</a> &#151; were received into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>: Wiseman was presented with a costly testimonial, and was invited to write for a popular encyclopedia an article on the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He gave evidence of his power as a temperate yet forcible <a href="01618a.htm">apologist</a>, in his admirable defence of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> against a violent attack published by John Poynder &#151; a defence which W. E. Gladstone described as "a masterpiece of clear and unanswerable argument"; and in the same year, 1836, he took the important step of founding, in association with Daniel O'Connell and <a href="12613a.htm">Michael Quin</a> (who became the first editor), the "Dublin Review", with the object, as he himself stated, not only of rousing <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to a greater enthusiasm for their religion, but of exhibiting to the representatives of English thought generally the variety, comprehensiveness, and elasticity of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system as he had been taught to regard it.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the autumn of 1836 Wiseman returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and for four more years held his post of <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the English College. While in no way slackening in the conscientious performance of his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, he found himself gradually more and more drawn towards, and personally interested in, the important religious movement developing in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; and this feeling was strengthened by his intercourse with Macaulay and Gladstone, of whom he saw much when they visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1838. He welcomed in them that spirit of outside sympathy with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> which had already seemed to him so striking and encouraging a phenomenon in men like von Ranke, A. W. Schlegel, and even Victor Hugo; and his correspondence during this period shows how in the midst of his multifarious <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he longed to be at the heart of the movement in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, working for it with all the versatile gifts at his command, and with all the personal influence which he could wield. He visited <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in the summer of 1839; and besides his active public engagements at that time &#151; giving retreats at Oscott and elsewhere, preaching at the opening of the new churches which were rising all over the country, and working, in conjunction with <a href="14214b.htm">Father Spencer</a>, for the spread of a new spirit of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> among <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> &#151; there appeared from his pen, in the "Dublin Review", the famous article on <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> which was a turning-point in the <a href="11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>, and pressed home the parallel between the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and the Tractarians with a convincing <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a> which placed many of the latter, in <a href="10794a.htm">Newman's</a> famous words, "on their death-bed as regarded the <a href="01498a.htm">Church of England</a>." Three months after the publication of this momentous article, Wiseman returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but he felt himself, as his letters show, that the future of his life's work was to be not in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> but in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>.</p>

<p>In 1840 <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> raised the number of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> from four to eight; and Wiseman was nominated coadjutor to Bishop Walsh of the Central District, and president of Oscott College. After making a retreat with the <a href="11521d.htm">Passionists</a> he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 4 June, in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the English College, with the title of <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Melipotamus, and held an <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> service next day. He left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 1 Aug., after twenty-two years' residence there, and took up his residence at Oscott, which it was his design from the first to make a centre in the work of drawing the Catholic-minded party in the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> towards <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. No encouragement in this <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> was forthcoming from his scholastic colleagues in the college, and the only support he received was in the unwavering sympathy of <a href="14214b.htm">Father Spencer</a>, and the enthusiasm of <a href="12558b.htm">A.W. Pugin</a>, a constant visitor at Oscott. Other distinguished men visited Wiseman there, such as Lords Spencer and Lyttelton, Daniel O'Connell, the Duc de Bordeaux, and many more; and though not interested in the routine of college life, and a great <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> rather than a successful president, he gave a prestige and distinction to Oscott which no one else could have done. A profound liturgist, he was most particular about the proper carrying-out of the ceremonial of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; and his humour, geniality, and kindness made him an especial favourite with the younger members of the college.</p>

<p>On the publication of the famous Tract 90, written to justify the simultaneous adherence to the Thirty-Nine Articles and to the Decrees of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> by <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergymen</a>, Wisemen entered upon direct correspondence with <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a>; and after more than four years of perplexity, <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and disappointed hopes, he had the <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> of confirming him at Oscott, subsequent to his reception into the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. But neither <a href="10794a.htm">Newman's</a> own conversion, nor that of a large number of his most distinguished disciples, sufficed to break down the wall of reserve and suspicion which had always separated the "Old English" <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, such as <a href="09270c.htm">Lingard</a> and his <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, from the leaders of the <a href="11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>. The sincerity of their <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leanings had been <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> when they were <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; and the sincerity of their conversion was equally suspected now that they were <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Wiseman, on the other hand, saw in every fresh accession new ground for serious hope for the return of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity. He enlisted the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of many Continental <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for this intention, and worked unceasingly to promote a cordial understanding between new converts and old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and to make the Oxford <a href="10742a.htm">neophytes</a> at home in their new surroundings. Many of them found shelter and occupation at Oscott, and the "Dublin Review" was strengthened by an infusion of new writers from their ranks. Deeply interested, as was natural, in the future of <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> and his immediate followers, Wiseman concerned himself closely with the project, ultimately realized in <a href="02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, of founding an Oratory in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he had himself been appointed pro-vicar Apostolic of the London District, and had (in July, 1847) visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> on business of the utmost importance in relation to <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. He was deputed by his brother <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to submit to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the question of revising the constitution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and of substituting for the <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> a regular <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, such as had existed in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> throughout the darkest days of the <a href="11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, and had recently been established in <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a>. In the changed circumstances of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> some new code of <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> was imperatively called for to supplement the obsolete constitution of 1753; but the project of creating a <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, which Wiseman favoured as the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> solution of the question, was strongly opposed by many <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, headed by Cardinal Acton, the only English member of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. The negotiations on the matter with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were interrupted by the exciting and important political events which followed the accession of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and the national Italian rising against <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Wiseman returned to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> charged with the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of appealing to the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> Government for support of the Papacy in carrying out its policy of <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>. <a href="15121a.htm">Bishop Ullathorne</a> was sent out to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> early in 1848 to continue in Wiseman's place the negotiations on the question of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> for <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; and he left on record his admiration of the calm and detailed consideration given to the subject by the authorities, at a time when revolution and disorder were almost at their height. All the evidence forthcoming seemed to show that the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> Government could find no reasonable cause of offence in the proposed measure; and it was on the point of being carried out when the Revolution burst in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> flight to <a href="06333a.htm">Gaeta</a> delayed the actual execution of the project for nearly two years.</p>

<p>Soon after Wiseman's return to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> he succeeded Dr. Walsh as <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the London District, and threw himself into his episcopal work with characteristic activity and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. The means he relied on for quickening the spiritual life of the district were, first, the frequent giving of retreats and missions both for <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, and secondly the revival of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, which had of course become entirely extinct in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> under the <a href="11611c.htm">penal laws</a>. Within two years he founded no less than ten <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, and had the satisfaction of seeing many of the converts either joining one of these communities, or working harmoniously as <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> with the other <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the district. A notable event in the annals of the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was the opening, at which Wiseman assisted, of the great Gothic Church of St. George's, <a href="14162b.htm">Southwark</a>, designed by <a href="12558b.htm">Pugin</a>, in July 1848. Fourteen <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 240 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and representatives of many <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders took part in the opening ceremonies, which were described in no unfriendly spirit by the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Press. A function on this scale in the capital of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> indicated, as was said at the time, that the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had indeed "come out of the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>"; but Wiseman had still much to contend with in the shape of strong opposition, on the part of both <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> of the old <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, to what was called the "Romanizing" and "innovating" spirit of the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In matters of devotion as well as of Church discipline every development was regarded by this party with suspicion and distrust; and no greater <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> could be adduced of the tact, <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and firmness of Wiseman in his difficult office, than the fact that in less than three years he had practically disarmed his opponents, and had won over to his own views, not only the rank and file, but the leaders of the party which had at first most strenuously resisted him.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the spring of 1850, just after the Gorham decision of the Privy Council, declaring the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> regeneration to be an open question in the <a href="01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, had resulted in a new influx of distinguished converts to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, Wiseman received the news of his impending elevation to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, carrying with it, as he supposed, the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of permanent residence in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Deeply as he regretted the prospect of a lifelong severance from his work in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, he loyally submitted to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> behest, and left <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, as he thought for ever, on 16 Aug. Meanwhile strong representations were being made at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the view of retaining his services at home; and he was able to write, immediately after his first audience of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, that it was decided that the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was to be proclaimed without delay, and that he was to return to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> as its chief. At a consistory held on 30 Sept. Nicholas Wiseman was named a <a href="03333b.htm#p">cardinal priest</a>, with the title of St. Pudentiana. The <a href="03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> re-establishing the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> had been issued on the previous day; and on 7 Oct. the newly-created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a> announced the event to <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in his famous pastoral "from outside the Flaminian Gate".</p>

<p>He left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> a few days later, travelling by Florence, <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he was the emperor's guest; and it was here that he first learned from a leading article in the "Times", worded in the most hostile terms, something of the sudden storm of bitter feeling aroused in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, not by his own elevation of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, but by the creation of an English <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> with territorial titles. Wiseman instantly wrote to the Premier, Lord John Russell, to deprecate the misconception in the public mind of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> act; but by the time he reached <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, in Nov., 1850, the fanatical fury of the agitation caused by the so-called "Papal aggression"; was at its height. Every article printed by the "Times" on the subject was more bitter than its predecessor: the premier's famous letter to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05211a.htm">Durham</a>, inveighing against the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> action as "insolent and insidious", fanned the flame: Queen Victoria showed her sympathy with the agitation in her reply to an address form the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; riotous public meetings, and the burning in effigy of <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, kept the whole country in a state of ferment for several weeks; and Wiseman in his progress through <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> was frequently hooted, and stones were thrown at the windows of his carriage. Nothing daunted, he instantly set about the composition of his masterly "Appeal to the Reason and Good Feeling of the English people on the subject of the Catholic Hierarchy", a pamphlet of some thirty pages, addressed to the people themselves rather than to the <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> minority who in the writer's view had so grossly and inexcusably misled them. The cogency and ability of the appeal was frankly recognized by the English Press, and the political enemies of the government were not slow to point out the inconsistency of its dealings with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> followed up the publication of his treatise by delivering a course of lectures on the same lines in St. George's Cathedral, and the note struck by him was taken up by Gladstone in the House of Commons. The Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, making the assumption by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of episcopal titles in the United Kingdom a penal offence, was introduced into Parliament early in 1851, and became law on 1 Aug.; but it was a dead letter from the first, as Gladstone had the <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> and prescience to declare that it would be. Its provisions were never enforced, and it was repealed during Gladstone's first premiership twenty years later. By the end of 1851 the No-popery agitation, as short-lived as it was violent, was dead and buried, the last nail having been knocked into its coffin by the unrivalled irony and brilliant rhetoric of the lectures on "The Present Position of Catholics", delivered by <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> in Birmingham in the summer of this year.</p>

<p>The anti-Catholic storm having been lulled, Wiseman made it his business to endeavour to restore those amicable relations between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> which had inevitably been somewhat disturbed by the recent outburst. He had many personal friends outside <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> circles, and his wide range of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> on many neutral subjects such as natural <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, archaeology, and Oriental studies, made him welcome in general <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. No one could be less like the "wily Roman <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>" of anti-popery fiction than the genial and thoroughly English gentleman, whose appearance, bearing, and conversation disarmed the prejudices and enlisted the sympathy of all with whom he was brought into contact. Not only by personal intercourse with his fellow-countrymen, but by his frequent appearances on the lecture-platform, he did much to influence public opinion in favour of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. His lectures were at first chiefly on religious subjects, delivered in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> in various parts of the country; but as time went on, and the many-sided character of his attainments became better known to the public, he was frequently asked to give addresses on topics connected with archaeology, art, and literature, not only in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> but in <a href="09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, <a href="09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, and other important centres. Large audiences, including many <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of distinction, attended on these occasions; and the speaker's graceful eloquence, genial <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>, and sympathetic voice and manner, enhanced the impression wrought by his intimate <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the various subjects with which he dealt. His delivery was fluent and his style brilliant, and characterized by a command of poetic imagery in which probably few public speakers have surpassed or equalled him.</p>

<p>While the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> slowly but surely advanced in the popular regard and esteem, as his gifts and qualities became more widely known, he was faced with many internal difficulties in the government of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The divergence of views, on questions of church policy and administration, between the old <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> (who were opposed as much to what they call the "importation of modern Roman <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>" as to the influx of converts and the re-establishment of regular orders in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>) and the enthusiastic recruits from Oxford such as Oakley, Talbot, Faber, and <a href="15552c.htm">Ward</a>, had by no means disappeared. Wiseman himself was regarded, even by some of his brother <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as something of an autocrat; and both before and after the first provincial synod held by him at Oscott (when <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> preached his famous sermon on the Second Spring), there was considerable agitation for the appointment of <a href="08173a.htm">irremovable</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and for the election of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> by the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Wiseman met these difficulties with his usual <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, moderation, and tact, steadfastly refusing to be drawn in to party controversies or to allow any public manifestation of party spirit. He went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the autumn of 1853 to explain matters personally to <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who showed him every mark of confidence and kindness, and gave full approval to his <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy.</p>

<p>It was during this visit to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> that Wiseman projected, and commenced to execute, the writing of by far the most popular book that came from his versatile pen &#151; the beautiful romance of "Fabiola", which was meant to be the first of a series of tales illustrative of different periods of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> life. The book appeared at the end of 1854, and its success was immediate and phenomenal. Translations of it were published in almost every <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> language, and the most eminent scholars of the day were unanimous in its praise. All this greatly consoled the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> when troubled and harassed by many vexations, and a spirit of new <a href="07131b.htm">cheerfulness</a> and <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> breathes from a sermon preached by him in May, 1855, dwelling in thankfulness and hope on the revival of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. In the autumn of 1855 he delivered, and afterwards published, four lectures on <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a>, in connection with the concordat recently concluded between <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The subject was treated with his usual exhaustive eloquence, and the lectures made a great impression, four editions of them being printed, as well as a German version with which the Emperor of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> expressed himself highly pleased.</p>

<p>The increasing pressure of episcopal and <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, as well as his greatly impaired health, induced Wiseman in 1855 to petition <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a coadjutor, and Rt. Rev. George Errington, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12171b.htm">Plymouth</a>, was appointed (with right of succession to the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>) in April of that year. He had worked under the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> both in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and at Oscott, and they were intimate friends; but their differences of character and temperament were so marked that Errington foresaw from the first, if Wiseman did not, that the new relation between them would be one full of difficulty. A rigorous disciplinarian of a somewhat narrow type, the coadjutor was bound, in matters of <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration, to come into collision with a chief who disliked the routine of business, and was apt to decide questions rather as prompted by his own wide and generous impulses than according to the strict letter of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. Before the year was out Errington had expressed in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> his dissatisfaction with his position and his readiness to retire from it.</p>

<p>For the moment the difficulties were smoothed over, but they were subsequently accentuated by the rapid rise to prominence in the archdiocese of <a href="09604b.htm">Henry Edward Manning</a>, who founded in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, in 1856, his congregation of Oblates of St. Charles, and became in the same year <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter. The story of the series of misunderstandings between Wiseman and <a href="09604b.htm">Manning</a> on one side, and Errington and the Westminster canons on the other, has been told at length, though not with complete accuracy or impartiality, in Purcell's "Life of Manning", and, in more trustworthy fashion, in Ward's "Life of Wiseman" (see also <a href="09604b.htm">MANNING</a>). Errington, gravely offended at the charges of anti-Roman spirit brought against him, persistently refused to resign his office; and as it became increasingly manifest that he and the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> could not work together with any advantage to the archdiocese, he was removed from the coadjutorship by <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 July, 1860. He declined the offer of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Trinidad, and spent the rest of his life in retirement in the <a href="04058c.htm">Diocese of Clifton</a>.</p>

<p>Wiseman's domestic trials during 1858 were agreeably varied by his visit to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in the early autumn of that year &#151; a visit which the enthusiasm of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> transformed into a kind of triumphal progress, and during which he delivered, in different parts of the island, sermons, lectures, and addresses afterwards printed in a volume of four hundred pages. Cheered by the warmth of the welcome accorded him by <a href="08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> of every class and creed, he returned home, improved in spirits if not in health, to find himself engrossed not only with the affairs of his archdiocese, but with the march of political events in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in which he was very keenly interested. He had lately published his "Recollections of the Last Four Popes", which had roused much interest both in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and on the Continent. His fervent loyalty to <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> found vent in a pastoral which he addressed from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, early in 1860, to the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> asking for contributions to the needs of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Later he founded an Academia in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, chiefly at the instance of <a href="09604b.htm">Manning</a>, who hoped through its means to kindle an enthusiasm for the temporal power of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Wiseman's own <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, reflected in his inaugural lecture in June, 1861, was rather than the new institution should encourage the scholarly and scientific researches which so greatly interested him. Both these objects were advocated in the early papers read at the Academia by Dr. Rock, <a href="15552c.htm">W.G. Ward</a>, and others. After 1860 Wiseman, realizing that his health was permanently broken, lived chiefly in the country, leaving the conduct of <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> affairs largely in the hands of <a href="09604b.htm">Manning</a> who possessed his entire confidence, though he was at this time far from popular in the archdiocese. Wiseman thought it prudent, early in 1861, to remove the Oblates from the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. He visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> that year, and again in 1862, in connection with the <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of the <a href="09744a.htm">Japanese martyrs</a>, and was treated by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> with special kindness and favour. We find him during the next two years, notwithstanding increasing bodily weakness, working with unabated <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> to redress <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> grievances, especially with regard to poor <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the position of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> soldiers and sailors, as well as the inmates of <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a>, reformatories, and workhouses. He attended a great <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress at <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> in June, 1863, and gave an address in French dealing with the progress of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> since the Emancipation Act of 1829. Later in the same year he interested himself warmly in the work undertaken by <a href="15311b.htm">Herbert (afterwards Cardinal) Vaughan</a>, of founding a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> for Foreign Missions in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. One of his last public utterances was an indignant pastoral published in May, 1864, in which, with his unfailing loyalty to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, he protested against the enthusiastic welcome of Garibaldi in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and especially against the adulation paid by <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to a man who had openly avowed his sympathy with <a href="02040a.htm">Atheism</a>. In the following October he assisted at the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, and on his return home occupied himself with the writing of a lecture on <a href="13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, which he hoped to deliver at the Royal Institution on 27 Jan., 1865. When that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> arrived, however, he was already on his death-bed. His last weeks were spent in religious exercises and preparation for death. The news of his illness and death evoked expressions of general sympathy from men of every class and every creed; and the practically unanimous voice of the Press testified to the high place he had won for himself in the respect and affections of his fellow-countrymen, to the astonishing change which had been wrought in fifteen years in the feelings entertained towards him by the people of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. His funeral at Kensal Green was made the occasion of an extraordinary popular demonstration, taking place, as the "Times" remarked, "amid such tokens of public interest, and almost of sorrow, as do not often mark the funerals even of our most illustrious dead".</p>
