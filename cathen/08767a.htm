<p><a href="06166a.htm">French</a> general and commander-in-chief of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> army, b. at <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, 5 February, 1806; d. at the ch&acirc;teau of Prouzel, near <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, 11 September, 1865. His father was descended from an old Breton <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> whose device was <em>Spes mea Deus</em>. His mother was Desir&eacute;e de Robineau de Bougon. He made his classical studies at the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, where his professor of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> who afterwards became the <a href="15024a.htm">Trappist</a> <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Bellefontaine. As had been the custom for centuries for the sons in his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, he was early destined for the army, and accordingly entered the Ecole Polytechnique, in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1826, and two years later the Ecole d'Application at <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>. He left the latter <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> with a commission as sub-lieutenant in the engineers and was sent to Montpellier. In 1830 he joined the detachment that took possession of <a href="01311a.htm">Algiers</a>, and was made a captain of Zouaves as a reward for gallant conduct.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>For seventeen years he remained in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, where he acquired a lasting reputation, acting not only as a valiant soldier, but as a pioneer of civilization, <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> and esteemed by the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> as well as by his own soldiers. In 1833 he was directed by the French government to organize the "Bureau Arabe", a sort of tribunal whose mission was to serve as mediator between <a href="06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> and <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. His authority was so great among the native tribes that he never carried any arms while travelling through the country, but only a stick with which to defend himself, and this <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be named Bou-Aroua (father with a stick). After the capture of Bougie, he was promoted major and in 1835 lieutenant-colonel of Zouaves. In that capacity he took part in many a <em>coup de main</em>, inspiring his troops with indomitable <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, and always placing himself at the most perilous spot. His intrepidity at the storming of Constantine gained him the rank of colonel (1837). In 1840, after the engagement of Mouza&iuml;a, he was raised to the rank of brigadier-general and was given the command of the division of <a href="11266a.htm">Oran</a>. In the following year he played a most prominent part in the expedition against Tagtempt and Mascara. Thanks to his skilful tactics and intrepidity, he subdued the tribe of Filtas (1843), and was created lieutenant-general. He next went to <a href="10574a.htm">Morocco</a> (1844), drove back the <a href="10424a.htm">Moorish</a> troops at Lalla-Maghnia, and contributed largely to the success of the battle at Isly (1845). Towards the end of that year, he was entrusted with the temporary governorship of Algeria. He then <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> his military career by surrounding Abd-el-Kader, who was compelled to surrender (23 November, 1847). Algeria being pacified, the distinguished soldier thought of retiring from military life and taking an active part in politics.</p>

<p>In 1846, having been elected deputy by the district of Saint-Calais (Sarthe), he had opposed the Guizot cabinet and created a stir by his speeches on Algeria and promotion in the army. On 21 April, 1847, he married Am&eacute;lie d'Auberville. In February, 1848, he held for a few days the portfolio of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> in the Thiers-Barrot cabinet, which he gave up when the Revolution burst out, causing the downfall of Louis Philippe. Having been elected to the Constituent Assembly (April, 1848) by the Department of Sarthe, he fought against the popular insurrection in June. On 28 June he again accepted the portfolio of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and directed all his efforts towards the organization of Algeria. When <a href="10699a.htm">Louis Napoleon</a>, to whose <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> he was strongly opposed, entered upon the presidency of the French Republic (20 December, 1848), he left the Cabinet and continued, as a deputy or as vice-president of the Assembly, to antagonize the Government. In the <em>Coup d'Etat</em> (2 December, 1852), he was arrested, <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, first at Mazas, then at Ham, and finally expelled from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. His political career had lasted only four years; his exile lasted nine years. This was the most distressing period of his life. He first travelled in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and then settled in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> pining in his enforced idleness, and longing for active occupation. It was then that he came back to the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of his youth. For many years, without being an infidel, he had neglected his religious <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, and even for a time had gone astray with the Saint-Simonians. Yielding to the entreaties of his friend <a href="10513b.htm">Charles de Montalembert</a>, the great <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> orator, he began to study one by one all the articles of the Credo. From that time to the day of his death he lived according to his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> as a devout <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.</p>

<p>In 1860 his cousin, Mgr. de M&eacute;rode, induced him to take command of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> army. It was a hazardous task. Ignoring the jeopardy of his established military reputation, he went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It took only one year to convince him that the undertaking was hopeless. His 8000 men were defeated by the 50,000 men of Cialdini at Castelfidardo (18 September, 1860), and <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a> was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to surrender. He bore this severe blow to his <a href="12776c.htm">reputation</a> with <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> resignation. Deeming his services no longer useful to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> army, he returned to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and went to live in his ch&acirc;teau of Chaillon (Maine-et-Loire). A national subscription was collected to present him with a sword of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, but he emphatically declined to receive it, on the ground that he was only a defeated general. The only distinction he ever accepted, under personal pressure from <a href="12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, was the Cross of the Order of Christ. His last years were devoted to <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> works. He built a <a href="02781a.htm">church</a> at his own expense for the poor <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Loroux-Beconnais, and contributed large sums to an <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a> and a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> which he had founded. He took pleasure in reading religious books, among which the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Bible</a>, the "Summa Theologica" of Saint Thomas, and the "History of the Church" by <a href="04636a.htm">Darras</a>, were his favourites. When the encyclical letter of 8 December, 1864, was published, he read it with delight, being <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> to find in it an answer to many questions which distressed him. His death was sudden. His name is now extinct, as he left only daughters, having lost his only son in 1859, but his fame will last forever as that of a gallant soldier and a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>
