<p><a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="14637b.htm">Tertiary</a>, born at <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>, 25 March, 1347; died at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 29 April, 1380.</p>

<p>She was the youngest but one of a very large <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. Her father, Giacomo di Benincasa, was a dyer; her mother, Lapa, the daughter of a local poet. They belonged to the lower middle-class faction of tradesmen and petty <a href="11122a.htm">notaries</a>, known as "the Party of the Twelve", which between one revolution and another ruled the <a href="13779a.htm">Republic of Siena</a> from 1355 to 1368. From her earliest childhood Catherine began to see <a href="15477a.htm">visions</a> and to practise extreme <a href="10578b.htm">austerities</a>. At the age of seven she <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> her <a href="15458a.htm">virginity</a> to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>; in her sixteenth year she took the habit of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="14637b.htm">Tertiaries</a>, and renewed the life of the <a href="01462b.htm">anchorites</a> of the desert in a little room in her father's house. After three years of <a href="15477a.htm">celestial visitations</a> and familiar conversation with <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, she underwent the <a href="10663b.htm">mystical</a> experience known as the <a href="09703a.htm">"spiritual espousals"</a>, probably during the carnival of 1366. She now rejoined her <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, began to tend the sick, especially those afflicted with the most repulsive diseases, to serve the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and to labour for the <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="14004b.htm">sinners</a>. Though always suffering terrible physical pain, living for long intervals on practically no food save the <a href="05572c.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, she was ever radiantly happy and full of practical wisdom no less than the highest spiritual insight. All her contemporaries bear witness to her extraordinary personal charm, which prevailed over the continual <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> to which she was subjected even by the <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of her own <a href="12354c.htm">order</a> and by her sisters in <a href="12748b.htm">religion</a>. She began to gather disciples round her, both men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, who formed a wonderful spiritual fellowship, united to her by the bonds of <a href="09397a.htm">mystical love</a>. During the summer of 1370 she received a series of special <a href="13005a.htm">manifestations</a> of <a href="10662a.htm">Divine mysteries</a>, which culminated in a prolonged trance, a kind of <a href="10663b.htm">mystical</a> death, in which she had a <a href="15477a.htm">vision</a> of <a href="07207a.htm">Hell</a>, <a href="12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, and <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and heard a Divine command to leave her cell and enter the public life of the world. She began to dispatch letters to men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> in every condition of life, entered into correspondence with the princes and republics of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was consulted by the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a> about the affairs of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and set herself to heal the wounds of her native land by staying the fury of civil <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and the ravages of faction. She implored the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>, to leave <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, to reform the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the administration of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, and ardently threw herself into his design for a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>, in the hopes of uniting the powers of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> against the <a href="10424a.htm">infidels</a>, and restoring peace to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> by delivering her from the wandering companies of mercenary soldiers. While at <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, on the <a href="08737c.htm">fourth Sunday of Lent</a>, 1375, she received the <a href="14294b.htm">Stigmata</a>, although, at her special <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the marks did not appear outwardly in her body while she lived.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Mainly through the misgovernment of the <a href="13147a.htm">papal officials</a>, <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> broke out between <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a> and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and almost the whole of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> rose in insurrection. Catherine had already been sent on a mission from the <a href="06799a.htm">pope</a> to secure the neutrality of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and <a href="09405a.htm">Lucca</a>. In June, 1376, she went to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> as ambassador of the <a href="06105c.htm">Florentines</a>, to make their peace; but, either through the bad faith of the republic or through a misunderstanding caused by the frequent changes in its government, she was unsuccessful. Nevertheless she made such a profound impression upon the <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="06799a.htm">pope</a>, that, in spite of the opposition of the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> king and almost the whole of the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, he returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (17 January, 1377). Catherine spent the greater part of 1377 in effecting a wonderful spiritual revival in the country districts subject to the <a href="13779a.htm">Republic of Siena</a>, and it was at this time that she <a href="10338a.htm">miraculously</a> learned to write, though she still seems to have chiefly relied upon her secretaries for her correspondence. Early in 1378 she was sent by <a href="06799a.htm">Pope Gregory</a> to <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, to make a fresh effort for peace. Unfortunately, through the factious conduct of her <a href="06105c.htm">Florentine</a> associates, she became involved in the internal politics of the city, and during a popular tumult (22 June) an attempt was made upon her <a href="09238c.htm">life</a>. She was bitterly disappointed at her escape, declaring that her <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> had deprived her of the red rose of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Nevertheless, during the disastrous revolution known as "the tumult of the Ciompi", she still remained at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a> or in its territory until, at the beginning of August, news reached the city that peace had been signed between the republic and the <a href="15216a.htm">new pope</a>. Catherine then instantly returned to <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>, where she passed a few months of comparative quiet, dictating her "Dialogue", the book of her meditations and <a href="13005a.htm">revelations</a>.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the <a href="13539a.htm">Great Schism</a> had broken out in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. From the outset Catherine enthusiastically adhered to the <a href="13164a.htm">Roman</a> claimant, <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, who in November, 1378, summoned her to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the <a href="13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> she spent what remained of her life, working strenuously for the reformation of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, serving the <a href="12327a.htm">destitute</a> and afflicted, and dispatching eloquent letters in behalf of <a href="15216a.htm">Urban</a> to high and low in all directions. Her strength was rapidly being consumed; she besought her <a href="08374c.htm">Divine Bridegroom</a> to let her bear the punishment for all the <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world, and to receive the <a href="13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of her body for the <a href="15179a.htm">unity</a> and renovation of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; at last it seemed to her that the Bark of <a href="11744a.htm">Peter</a> was laid upon her shoulders, and that it was crushing her to death with its weight. After a prolonged and mysterious agony of three months, endured by her with supreme <a href="07131b.htm">exultation and delight</a>, from <a href="13747a.htm">Sexagesima Sunday</a> until the <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> before the <a href="01767b.htm">Ascension</a>, she died. Her last political work, accomplished practically from her death-bed, was the reconciliation of <a href="15216a.htm">Pope Urban VI</a> with the Roman Republic (1380).</p>

<p>Among Catherine's principal followers were Fra Raimondo delle Vigne, of <a href="03319a.htm">Capua</a> (d. 1399), her confessor and biographer, afterwards General of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and Stefano di Corrado Maconi (d. 1424), who had been one of her secretaries, and became <a href="12427c.htm">Prior General</a> of the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>. Raimondo's book, the "Legend", was finished in 1395. A second life of her, the "Supplement", was written a few years later by another of her associates, Fra Tomaso Caffarini (d. 1434), who also composed the "Minor Legend", which was translated into <a href="08245a.htm">Italian</a> by Stefano Maconi. Between 1411 and 1413 the depositions of the surviving witnesses of her life and work were collected at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, to form the famous "Process". Catherine was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="12126c.htm">Pius II</a> in 1461. The emblems by which she is known in <a href="03710a.htm">Christian art</a> are the lily and book, the <a href="04540b.htm">crown of thorns</a>, or sometimes a heart--referring to the <a href="09128a.htm">legend</a> of her having changed hearts with <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Her principal <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is on the 30th of April, but it is popularly celebrated in <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> on the <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> following. The <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> of her <a href="09703a.htm">Espousals</a> is kept on the Thursday of the carnival.</p>

<p>The works of St. Catherine of Siena rank among the classics of the <a href="08245a.htm">Italian language</a>, written in the beautiful <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> vernacular of the fourteenth century. Notwithstanding the existence of many excellent <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, the printed editions present the text in a frequently mutilated and most unsatisfactory condition. Her writings consist of</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the "Dialogue", or "Treatise on <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>";</li><li>a collection of nearly four hundred letters; and</li><li>a series of "Prayers".</li></ul></div>

<p>The "Dialogue" especially, which treats of the whole spiritual life of <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> in the form of a series of colloquies between the <a href="06608a.htm">Eternal Father</a> and the <a href="14153a.htm">human soul</a> (represented by Catherine herself), is the <a href="10663b.htm">mystical</a> counterpart in prose of <a href="04628a.htm">Dante's</a> "Divina Commedia".</p>

<p>A smaller work in the dialogue form, the "Treatise on Consummate Perfection", is also ascribed to her, but is probably spurious. It is impossible in a few words to give an adequate conception of the manifold character and contents of the "Letters", which are the most complete expression of Catherine's many-sided personality. While those addressed to <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and sovereigns, rulers of republics and leaders of armies, are documents of priceless value to students of <a href="07365a.htm">history</a>, many of those written to private citizens, men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> in the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> or in the world, are as fresh and illuminating, as wise and practical in their advice and guidance for the devout <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> today as they were for those who sought her counsel while she lived. Others, again, lead the reader to <a href="10663b.htm">mystical</a> heights of <a href="04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, a rarefied atmosphere of <a href="13428b.htm">sanctity</a> in which only the few privileged spirits can hope to dwell. The key-note to Catherine's teaching is that <a href="09580c.htm">man</a>, whether in the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> or in the world, must ever abide in the cell of self-knowledge, which is the stable in which the traveller through <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> to <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> must be born again.</p>
