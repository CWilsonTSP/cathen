<p><a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, an eminent canonist, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> diplomat, and reformer, b. 1472 (1474) at Bologna, the son of Giovanni Campeggio, a famous civil lawyer; d. at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 25 July, 1539. He studied <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a> under his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> at Padua and Bologna, and in due course married and had a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of five children. After the death of his wife (1509), he entered the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. In 1512 he was appointed to the Bishopric of Feltre by <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, and was made auditor of the <a href="13205c.htm">Rota</a>, at that time the supreme court of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the universal court of appeal. Thenceforth till his death he took a leading part as <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> representative in some of the greatest events of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, especially in Southern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1513 he was sent by <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> as Nuncio to Maximilian I, to bring about peace among the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes and unite them in a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. While still in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> he was nominated <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (1 July, 1517), at first of the Title of San Tommaso in Parione, afterwards of Sant' Anastasia, and finally of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Trastevere. Returning to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was sent as <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> for the purpose of engaging <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>. He set out on his journey in the middle of April, 1518, but was not allowed to enter <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> until the end of July. The delay arose from Henry's objection to the presence of a foreign <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> within his dominions. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed that Campeggio should share the legatine powers with <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, who was his senior in the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. Accordingly the two <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> worked together, though <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> managed to secure the precedence. The main object of Campeggio's mission was not accomplished; instead of a universal league against the Turk, <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> arranged an alliance between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. He also contrived to obtain an extension of his legatine powers for three years and afterwards for life. Campeggio made a favourable impression on Henry, who bestowed upon him the Bishopric of <a href="13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> (which he held until 1534) and the Roman residence now known as the Giraud-Torlonia palace, then recently built from <a href="02736a.htm">Bramante's</a> designs.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On his return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (28 November, 1519), Campeggio was appointed to the <em>Segnatura</em>, at that time a post of the highest dignity and power. When <a href="01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a> was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (1522), many plans for reform of the abuses in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> were submitted to him. One of the best and most thorough-going of these was that of Campeggio. He boldly declared that the chief source of all the evils was the <a href="13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, of which, as has been stated, he was himself a most influential member. He recommended that the powers of the Dataria, whose officials he styled "blood-suckers", should be greatly curtailed; that <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> should not be combined, or reserved, or held in commendam; and that none but able and virtuous men should be appointed to them. He bewailed the fact that the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had, by means of <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a>, surrendered the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to the <a href="02137c.htm">secular powers</a>. He spoke strongly against the reckless granting of <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a>: especially against those of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and those connected with the contributions towards the building of St. Peter's in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As one who had held high diplomatic posts, he urged the importance of peace between the <a href="03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> and <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I of France</a>, so that these two great monarchs might join hands against the common enemy, the Turk. He also pleaded strongly for the extirpation of the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> by the enforcement of the Edict of Worms. Adrian's pontificate was too short to enable him to carry out any of the proposed reforms. His successor, <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, appointed Campeggio to the See of Bologna and sent him to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> as <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> (8 January, 1524).</p>

<p>Campeggio soon had reason to note the vast changes which had taken place since his former visit. At Augsburg he was grossly insulted by the populace; at <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to dispense with the ceremonies of a public entry. He adopted a conciliatory attitude at the diet which was being held at the latter city, but he insisted that the Edict of Worms should be carried out. The members of the diet demanded that a national council should be held at <a href="14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, but he induced the emperor to veto this, on condition that a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> should be summoned at <a href="15035a.htm">Trent</a>. Moreover he obtained from Charles a promise that the Edict of Worms should be enforced. Campeggio, however, saw clearly that the spread of the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> could be checked only by a reform of the German <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. For this purpose he held an assembly of twelve <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with the Archduke Ferdinand and the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> dukes. The outbreak of the <a href="11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a> (November, 1524) destroyed all hope of a peaceful solution of the difficulties with the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. Campeggio was recalled because his efforts had not met with the success which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had expected, and also because he was said to be on too friendly terms with the emperor. He was back in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> 20 October, 1525, and was made a member of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> commission on the affairs of the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>. During the sack of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the imperial troops (1527), he remained with Clement in Castel Sant' Angelo, and after the escape of the pontiff was left behind as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>.</p>

<p>The next year (1528), at <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> request, he was sent to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> to form, jointly with <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, a court to try the so-called <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> suit of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. (For a complete account of the case see article <a href="07222a.htm">H<font size=-2>ENRY</font> VIII</a>.) Here we need only refer to Campeggio's conduct in it. He did his best to escape the responsibility which the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> thrust upon him, for he <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> well the difficulties both of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and fact connected with the case; and he thoroughly realized, from his intimate acquaintance with Henry and Charles (Catherine's nephew), that, whichever way it was decided, a great nation would be lost to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. His instructions were to proceed with extreme slowness and caution; to bring about if possible the reconciliation of Henry with Catherine; and under no circumstances to come to a final decision. In spite of all <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> wiles and the bribes held out to him by the king, he refused to express any opinion and adhered strictly to the orders which he had received. He did, indeed, try his best to induce Catherine to enter a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, but when she with much spirit declined to do so, he praised her conduct. In the trial (June-July, 1529), it should be noted, Campeggio treated <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> as a subordinate and as the king's advocate rather than as a judge. On the last day (23 July), when everyone expected the final decision, he boldly adjourned the court. Some days later the news arrived that Catherine's appeal had already been received in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and that the case was reserved to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. On his way back to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> Campeggio was detained at Dover, while his baggage was searched by the king's officials in the hope of finding the <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a> <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> defining the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a>. But the prudent <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> had already destroyed the document, and the search only <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that he left the country poorer than when he had entered it.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>We next find Campeggio at Bologna, his episcopal city, present at the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a> by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (24 February, 1530), and afterwards accompanying the emperor to the Diet of Augsburg as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>. His influence was now greater than ever. He wrote triumphantly to Clement, assuring him that all would soon be made right in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He opposed the holding of a council, because he did not <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a> of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and relied chiefly on the exercise of the imperial authority to put down <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> by force. After Clement's death (25 September, 1534), Campeggio returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and took part in the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> in which <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a> was elected. By him he was appointed to the <a href="14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> See of <a href="11421a.htm">Praeneste</a> (<a href="11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>), and was sent to <a href="15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> for the opening of the council. His death took place, as above stated, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and he was buried at Bologna.</p>
