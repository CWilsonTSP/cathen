<p>A constitutional college of the National University of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. By its charter, granted 2 Dec., 1908, in accordance with the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Universities Act of that year, members of the college include every graduate of the Royal University of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> who was a matriculated student of "University College, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin, or of the Medical School, Cecilia Street, Dublin". Thus the history of the existing college is linked with the story of <a href="10794a.htm">Newman's</a> foundation in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. From 112 November, 1883, when the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> opened University College, St. Stephen's Green, <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in the old Arts School of the Catholic University, to 1 November, 1909, when the new college began its work, the history of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and national <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> centred mainly in the St. Stephen's Green institution. The <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> had two purposes to fulfil; first, to show by its success in the competitive field that <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had the material and capacity, given equal opportunity, to establish a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> of their own upon the highest academic level; second, to afford a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> training to young <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, whom <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> prevented from availing of Trinity College, with its <a href="12493a.htm">Protestant Episcopalian</a> atmosphere, or of the Queen's Colleges, with their secularist atmosphere. The first president of University College was Rev. William Delany, S.J. With an interval filled by Rev. Robert Carbery, S.J., Father Delany continued in office until the new college was founded. His colleagues of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> at the beginning were Rev. Thomas Finlay, <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="12213b.htm">economist</a>, Rev. Denis Murphy, <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> historian, Rev. James J. O'Carroll, Gaelic scholar and linguist, <a href="16045b.htm">Rev. Gerard Hopkins</a>, Oxford Classicist and poet, and Rev. Robert Curtis, mathematician. Of <a href="10794a.htm">Newman's</a> old guard and their first successors there still remained Thomas Arnold, son of the Master of Rugby, Robert Ornsby, the biographer of <a href="07467a.htm">Hope Scott</a>, James Stewart, a Cambridge <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> who had followed <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a>, John Casey, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> mathematician, Dr. John Egan, afterwards <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Waterford, and Abb&eacute; Polin. Among the assistant professors selected by Father Delany were Mr. William J. Starkie, a Cambridge scholar, now Resident Commissioner of National Education, and Mr. (now Sir) Joseph Magrath, the present registrar of the National University. Father Delany began practically without endowment. The only public assistance received was indirect. Beaconsfield's University Act empowered the senate of the Royal University to appoint Fellows, with a salary of 400 pounds a year out of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> revenues, on condition of their examining for the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> and lecturing at certain assigned colleges. Fourteen Fellows, out of twenty-eight, were assigned to University College, the remainder to the Queen's Colleges, already endowed to the extent of 12,500 pounds a year each. Two of the first Fellows were <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>; some years later the number was increased to five, and with their salaries the equipment and maintenance of the college were undertaken.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>At the end of the first academic year a hundred of the distinctions awarded by the Royal University were won by Queen's College, Belfast; seventy-nine by University College, <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, twenty by Queen's College, <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a>, and eight by students of Queen's College, <a href="06373a.htm">Galway</a>. This success of the unendowed college could not be ignored. In the Parliamentary session following (1885) the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Party raised the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> question under the new aspect it had assumed. The Chief Secretary (Sir Michael Hicks-Beach) at once admitted the necessity for government action. For the Government he promised that, if they held office in the next session, he would "make some proposal which might deal in a satisfactory way with this most important matter". The year 1886, however, brought its change of Government, Gladstone's first Home Rule Bill, the Liberal <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Alliance, and its developments; and the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> question as a question of practical politics was shelved for a generation.</p>

<p>The University College continued its work with ever-increasing success. Year by year the tabulated results of the examinations of the Royal University showed that the unrecognized Catholic University College was not only doing better than even the most successful of the well-endowed Queen's Colleges, but that it was ever increasing its lead until it far out-distanced the three together. The following table shows the relative endowments of the <a href="04107b.htm">colleges</a> and the first-class distinctions won by each college in the year 1898 compared with those ten years later.</p>

<blockquote><p>University College, Dublin <br><em>Endowments:</em> &#163;6,000 <br><em>Prizes and Honours (1898):</em> 40 <br><em>Prizes and Honours (1908):</em> 99</p> <p>Queen's College, Belfast <br><em>Endowments:</em> &#163;11,400 <br><em>Prizes and Honours (1898):</em> 28 <br><em>Prizes and Honours (1908):</em> 22</p> <p>Queen's College, Galway <br><em>Endowments:</em> &#163;11,400 <br><em>Prizes and Honours (1898):</em> 5 <br><em>Prizes and Honours (1908):</em> 5</p> <p>Queen's College, Cork <br><em>Endowments:</em> &#163;11,400 <br><em>Prizes and Honours (1898):</em> 1 <br><em>Prizes and Honours (1908):</em> 0</p></blockquote>

<p>In scholarship, in literature, in the public service, past students began to win <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> for their college. Even in the department of scientific research, hampered as was the staff by lack of equipment, the work of Preston, M'Clelland, and Conway established the name of the college in the annals of scientific advance. Murphy's work for <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> history, Hogan's in the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> language, and Finlay's in the field of practical <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> economics were also far-reaching. An aim of Father Delany had been to train a thoroughly competent staff to meet the time when <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> should be done and a wider field opened. This, too, was fulfilled; and the men selected for the first appointments to the chartered college by the commissioners entrusted with the work, unfettered though the commissioners were in their discretion, include, in all the chief departments, a large majority of men who had been <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in University College.</p>

<p>In 1904 Mr. Balfour and Mr. Wyndham made acknowledgement of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> claims; two royal commissions had reported in their favour; but the <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> were deterred by Orange influence from its settlement. Mr. Bryce took up the question in <a href="06147a.htm">courageous</a> fashion during his brief chief secretary-ship. It was left to Mr. Birrell to carry a measure granting facilities for University <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> under conditions fairly satisfactory to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> facilitated the reform in every way and, though they might have put forward a title to special consideration, they sought no peculiar recognition. Cardinal Logue declared the settlement to be largely due to their labours. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a> expressed his admiration for "the fidelity, constancy, and undaunted <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>" which they had shown in the enterprise. Many years before, in 1886, when jealous criticism was afoot, Father Delany had already defined their interest to be to establish "a central College, which should be national in its Constitution; should be governed by a body representative of the whole <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people, with all its interests; where the main condition of appointments to posts should be excellence of qualification, the best man winning whether <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>". The new constitution of the college approaches that ideal. Mr. Birrell, when introducing his University Bill, bore testimony to "the patriotism" of Father Delany's attitude. The passing of the University Act coincided with the silver jubilee of the old college; and when the new college came into existence the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, in order to facilitate its commencement, surrendered to it, with the approval of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the old buildings of the Catholic University.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The new <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Universities Act of 1908 is based on the principle of the non-recognition of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> or religious teaching. No part of the public endowment can be applied for the purpose of such teaching. But the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> may recognize a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty or a religious chair provided by private <a href="05421b.htm">endowment</a>. The indifferentist principle was accepted by <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> because the scheme of government embodied in the charters both for the National University and for its constituent colleges enabled a sympathetic government to be established. The first senate and the first governing bodies were nominated, and the governing body of University College, <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, now consists of twenty-seven <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and three <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. When it ceases to hold office the new governing body will be constituted mainly of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> elected by the college corporation itself, and by the General Council of Irish County Councils, which represents <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> opinion. In the first appointment of deans of residence two <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were among those appointed. They <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> provide religious lectures in addition to discharging the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of their office. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> have also in hand (1912) a scheme for the establishment of a lectureship in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> in the college and have selected Rev. Peter Finlay, S.J., for the office. The growth of this side of the college work would complete its activities as a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> institution. All the other faculties are adequately provided for, and include arts, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Celtic studies (including arch&aelig;ology, history, and philology), <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, medicine, and engineering. The staff consists of the president (Dr. D.J. Coffey, dean of the old successful medical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>), forty-three professors, and eight lecturers. All the professors of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The public endowment of the college is &#163;32,000 a year and the total revenue in 1910-11 was &#163;40,357. Six hundred and ninety-five students were in attendance in that year. The first plan of buildings provides for eight hundred students. One hundred and ten thousand pounds of public grant is available for their erection and equipment, but it will certainly prove inadequate, and must be supplemented from either public or private sources. So far, though the college is open to all, ninety-eight per cent of the students are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>
