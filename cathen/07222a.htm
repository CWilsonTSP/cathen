<p>King of <a href="05431b.htm">England</a>, born 28 June, 1491; died 28 January, 1547.</p>

<p>He was the second son and third child of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, Henry VII. His elder brother Arthur died in April, 1502, and consequently Henry became heir to the throne when he was not yet quite eleven years old. It has been asserted that Henry's <a href="08075a.htm">interest</a> in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions was due to the bias of his early <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, since he had at first been destined by his father for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. But a child of eleven can hardly have formed lifelong intellectual tastes, and it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that secular titles, such as those of Earl Marshal and Viceroy of Ireland, were heaped upon him when he was five. On the other hand there can be no question as to the boy's great precocity and as to the liberal scope of the studies which he was made to pursue from his earliest years.</p>

<p>After Arthur's death a project was at once formed of marrying him to his brother's <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a>, Catherine of Aragon, who, being born in December, 1485, was more than five years his senior. The negotiations for a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> took some little <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, and the <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="08177a.htm">Queen Isabella</a>, the mother of Catherine, then nearing her end, grew very impatient. Hence a hastily drafted <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> containing the required <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> was privately sent to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1504, to be followed some months later by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> to the same effect which was of a more public <a href="03584b.htm">character</a>. The existence of these two instruments afterwards caused complications. Owing, however, to some political scheming of Henry VII &#151; who was trying to outwit his rival Ferdinand &#151; Prince Henry, on attaining the age of fourteen, was made to record a formal protest against the proposed <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a> with Catherine, as a matter arranged without his <a href="04283a.htm">consent</a>. Still, when his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> died in 1509, Henry carried out the <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a> nine weeks after his <a href="01095a.htm">accession</a>, he being then eighteen, and showing from the first a thorough determination to be his own master. Great popularity was won for the new reign by the <a href="02059c.htm">attainder</a> and <a href="12565a.htm">execution</a> of Empson and Dudley, the instruments of the late king's extortion. Besides this, it is unanimously attested by contemporaries that the young sovereign possessed every <a href="06553a.htm">gift</a> of <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> and <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> which could arouse the enthusiasm of his people. His skill in manly sports was almost equalled by his <a href="08066a.htm">intelligence</a> and his devotion to letters. Of the complicated foreign policy which marked the beginning of his reign no detail can be given here. Thanks partly to Henry's <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>, but still more to the ability of <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, who soon took the first place in the council chamber, <a href="05431b.htm">England</a> for the first time became a <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> power. In 1512 Henry joined <a href="08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a>, Ferdinand of Spain, and the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> in forming the "Holy League" against the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="08562a.htm">Julius</a> was feverishly bent on chasing the "barbarians" (i.e. the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> and other foreigners) out of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Henry cooperated by collecting ships and soldiers to attack the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> king in his own dominions. No very conspicuous success attended his arms, but there was a victory at Guinegate outside Therouanne, and the <a href="13613a.htm">Scotch</a>, who, as the allies of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, had threatened invasion, were disastrously defeated at Flodden in 1513. During all this time Henry remained on excellent terms with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In April, 1510, <a href="08562a.htm">Julius</a> sent him the <a href="06629a.htm">golden rose</a>, and in 1514 <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> bestowed the honorific cap and sword, which were presented with much <a href="14133a.htm">solemnity</a> at St. Paul's.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The League having been broken up by the selfish policy of Ferdinand, Henry VIII now made peace with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and for some years held the balance of power on the <a href="05607b.htm">Continent</a>, though not without parting with a good deal of money. <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> was made a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1515 and exercised more influence than ever, but it was somewhat against his advice that Henry, in 1519, secretly became a candidate for the <a href="01641a.htm">succession</a> to the empire, though pretending at the same time to support the candidature of <a href="06207a.htm">Francis</a>, his ally. When, however, <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a> was successful, the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> king could not afford to quarrel with Henry, and a somewhat hollow and insincere renewal of their friendship took place in June, 1520, at the famous "Field of the Cloth of Gold", when the most elaborate courtesies were exchanged between the two monarchs. The prospect of this <em>rapprochement</em> had so alarmed the <a href="03625a.htm">Emperor Charles</a> that, a month before it took place, he visited Henry in <a href="05431b.htm">England</a>. In point of fact a continuous game of intrigue was being played by all three monarchs, which lasted until the period when Henry's final breach with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> led him to turn his principal attention to domestic concerns. Meanwhile the strength of Henry's position at home had been much developed by <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> judicious diplomacy, and, despite the costliness of some of <a href="05431b.htm">England's</a> demonstrations against <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, before the French king became the emperor's <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at <a href="11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, the odium of the demand for money fell upon the minister, while Henry retained all his popularity. Indeed, whatever disaffection might be felt, the people had no leader to make rebellion possible. The old nobility, partly as a result of the Wars of the Roses, and partly owing to the repressive policy dictated by the dynastic fears of Henry VII, had been reduced to impotence. In 1521 the most prominent noble in <a href="05431b.htm">England</a>, the Duke of Buckingham, was condemned to <a href="12565a.htm">death</a> for <a href="15026b.htm">high treason</a> by a subservient House of Peers, simply because the king suspected him of aiming at the succession and had determined that he must die. At the same period Henry's prestige in the eyes of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and not the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> only, was strengthened by his famous book, the <em>Assertio Septem Sacramentorum</em>. This book was written against <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> and in vindication of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> teaching regarding the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the <a href="10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, while the supremacy of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> is also insisted upon in unequivocal terms. There is no reason to <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the substance of the book was really Henry's. <a href="09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a> was highly pleased with it and conferred upon the king the title of <em>Fidei Defensor</em> (Defender of the Faith), which is maintained to this day as part of the royal style of the English Crown. All this success and adulation were calculated to develop the natural masterfulness of Henry's character. He had long shown to discerning eyes, like those of <a href="14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a>, that he would brook contradiction in nothing. Without being guilty of notable profligacy in comparison with the other monarchs of his time, it is <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> if Henry's married life had ever been pure, even from the first, and we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that in 1519 he had, by Elizabeth Blount, a son whom, at the age of six, he made the Duke of <a href="13050a.htm">Richmond</a>. He had also carried on an intrigue with Mary Boleyn which led to some complications at a later date.</p>

<p>Such was Henry when, probably about the beginning of the year 1527, he formed a <a href="15446a.htm">violent</a> passion for Mary's younger sister, Anne. It is possible that the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> had suggested itself to the king much earlier than this (<em>see</em> Brown, "Venetian Calendars", II, 479), and it is highly probable that it was motivated by the desire of male issue, of which he had been disappointed by the death in infancy of all Catherine's children save <a href="09766a.htm">Mary</a>. Anne Boleyn was restrained by no <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> scruples, but she saw her opportunity in Henry's infatuation and determined that she would only yield as his acknowledged queen. Anyway, it soon became the one absorbing object of the king's desires to secure a <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> from Catherine, and in the pursuit of this he condescended to the most unworthy means. He had it put about that the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14453a.htm">Tarbes</a>, when negotiating an alliance in behalf of the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> king, had raised a <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the <a href="09766a.htm">Princess Mary's</a> legitimacy. He also prompted <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>, to hold with <a href="15554a.htm">Archbishop Warham</a> a private and collusive inquiry, summoning Henry to <a href="12454c.htm">prove</a> before them that his <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a> was valid. The only result was to give Catherine an inkling of what was in the king's <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>, and to elicit from her a solemn declaration that the <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a> had never been consummated. From this it followed that there had never been any <a href="07695a.htm">impediment</a> of <a href="01178a.htm">"affinity"</a> to bar her union with Henry, but only the much more easily <a href="05041a.htm">dispensed</a> <a href="07695a.htm">impediment</a> known as <a href="12554a.htm"><em>publicae honestatis</em></a>. The best canonists of the time also held that a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> which formally removed the <a href="07695a.htm">impediment</a> of <a href="01178a.htm">affinity</a> also involved by implication that of <a href="12554a.htm"><em>publicae honestatis</em></a>, or "public decency." The collective suit was thereupon dropped, and Henry now set his hopes upon a direct <a href="01652a.htm">appeal</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, acting in this independently of <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, to whom he at first communicated nothing of his design so far as it related to Anne. William Knight, the king's secretary, was sent to <a href="04024a.htm">Pope Clement VII</a> to sue for the declaration of nullity of his union with Catherine, on the ground that the dispensing <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a> was obreptitious &#151; i.e. obtained by <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> pretences. Henry also petitioned, in the event of his becoming free, a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to contract a new <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a> with any <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> even in the first degree of <a href="01178a.htm">affinity</a>, whether the <a href="01178a.htm">affinity</a> was contracted by lawful or unlawful connexion. This clearly had reference to Anne Boleyn, and the fictitious nature of Henry's conscientious <a href="13640a.htm">scruples</a> about his <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a> is betrayed by the fact that he himself was now applying for a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of precisely the same nature as that which he <a href="13640a.htm">scrupled</a> about, a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> which he later on maintained the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had no power to grant.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As the <a href="04024a.htm">pope</a> was at that time the <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, Knight had some difficulty in obtaining access to him. In the end the king's envoy had to return without accomplishing much, though the (conditional) <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> for a new <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a> was readily accorded. Henry had now no choice but to put his great matter into the hands of <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, and <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, although the whole <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> policy ran counter to his better judgment, strained every nerve to secure a decision in his master's favour. An account of the mission of Gardiner and Foxe and of the failure of the <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> proceedings before the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> commissioners, <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a> and <a href="03223a.htm">Campeggio</a>, mainly on account of the production of the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>, has been given in some detail in the article <a href="04024a.htm">CLEMENT VII</a>, to which the reader is referred. The <a href="13007a.htm">revocation</a> of the cause to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in July, 1529, owing, no doubt, in part to Queen Catherine's most reasonable protests against her helplessness in <a href="05431b.htm">England</a> and the compulsion to which she was subjected, had many important results. First among these we must count the disgrace and fall of <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, hitherto the only real check upon Henry's wilfulness. The incredible meanness of the praemunire, and consequent confiscation, which the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was pronounced to have incurred for obtaining the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> and <a href="09118a.htm">legateship</a> from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> &#151; though of course this had been done with the king's full <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="04283a.htm">consent</a> &#151; would alone suffice to stamp Henry as one of the basest of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a>. But, secondly, we may trace to this same crisis the rise of both Cranmer and Thomas Cromwell, the two great architects of Henry's new policy. It was Cranmer who, in the autumn of 1529, made the momentous suggestion that the king should consult the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> upon the question of the nullity of his <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a>, a suggestion which at once brought its author into favour.</p>

<p>The project was carried out as soon as possible with a lavish expenditure of <a href="02778c.htm">bribes</a>, and the use of other means of pressure. The result was naturally highly favourable to the king's wishes, though the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> which lay within the dominions of <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a> were not consulted. The answers were submitted to Parliament, where the king still kept the pretense of having no personal interest in the matter. He professed to be suffering from <a href="13640a.htm">scruples</a> of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, now rendered more acute by such a weight of learned opinion. With the same astuteness he persuaded the leading nobility of the kingdom to write to the <a href="04024a.htm">pope</a> praying him to give <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> in Henry's favour for fear that worse might follow. All this drew the king into closer relations with Cranmer, who was made ambassador to the <a href="03625a.htm">emperor</a>, and who, a year or two afterwards, despite the fact that he had just <a href="09707a.htm">married</a> Osiander's niece (his second wife), was summoned home to become <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. The <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> and the <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> were obtained from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> under threat that the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> (referred to again below) for the abolition of <a href="01537b.htm">annates</a> and <a href="06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> would be made permanent. The vacillating <a href="04024a.htm">Clement</a> &#151; who probably hoped that by making every other kind of concession he might be able to maintain the position he had assumed upon the more vital question of the <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> &#151; conceded <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> and <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a>. But to benefit by them it was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that Cranmer should take certain prescribed <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a> of obedience to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He took the <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a>, but committed to writing a solemn protest that he considered the <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a> in no way binding in <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, a procedure which even so prejudiced a historian as Mr. H.A. Fisher cannot refrain from describing as a "signal dishonesty." "If", asks <a href="09270c.htm">Dr. Lingard</a>, "it be <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> to purchase spiritual office by money, what is it to purchase the same by <a href="11696a.htm">perjury</a>?" The father of the new <a href="01498a.htm">Church of England</a>, and future compiler of its <a href="09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, was not entering upon his functions under very propitious auspices.</p>

<p>But the <a href="01498a.htm">Church</a> which was soon to be brought into being probably owes even more to Thomas Cromwell than to its first <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. It is Cromwell who seems to have suggested to Henry as a deliberate policy that he should abolish the <em>imperium in imperio</em>, throw off the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy, and make himself the supreme head of his own religion. This was in fact the course which from the latter part of 1529 Henry undeviatingly followed, though he did not at first go to lengths from which there was no retreat. The first blow was struck at the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> by involving them in <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> praemunire. Some anti-clerical disaffection there had always been, partly, no doubt, the remnants of <a href="09333a.htm">Lollardy</a>, as was instanced in the case of Richard Hunne, 1515. This, of late years, had been a good deal aggravated by the importation into <a href="05431b.htm">England</a> of Tyndale's annotated <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and other books of <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> tendency, which, though prohibited and burnt by authority, still made their way among the people. Henry and his <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> had, therefore, some popular support upon which they could fall back, if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in their campaign to reduce the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to abject submission. At the beginning of 1531 the <a href="04348a.htm">Convocation of Canterbury</a> were informed that they could purchase a pardon for the praemunire they had incurred by presenting the king with the enormous sum of 100,000 pounds. Further, they were bidden to recognize the king as "Protector and Supreme Head of the <a href="01498a.htm">Church of England</a>." <a href="04348a.htm">Convocation</a> struggled desperately against the demand, and in the end succeeded in inserting the qualification "so far as is allowed by the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But this was only a brief respite. A year later Parliament under pressure passed an edict forbidding the payment to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> of <a href="01537b.htm">Annates</a> or <a href="06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, but the operation of it was for the present suspended at the sovereign's pleasure, and the king was meanwhile solicited to come to an amicable understanding with "His Holiness" on the subject of the <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a>. The measure amounted to a decently veiled threat to withdraw this source of income from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> altogether if the <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> was refused. Still the <a href="04024a.htm">pope</a> held out, and so did the queen. Only a little time before, a deputation of lords and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> &#151; of course by the king's order &#151; had visited Catherine and had rudely urged her to withdraw the appeal in virtue of which the king, contrary to his dignity, had been cited to appear personally at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but though deprived of all counsel, she stood firm. In the May of 1532 further pressure was brought to bear upon <a href="04348a.htm">Convocation</a>, and resulted in the so-called "Submission of the Clergy", by which they practically renounced all <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> of legislation except in dependence upon the king.</p>

<p>An honest man like <a href="14689c.htm">Sir Thomas More</a> could no longer pretend to work with the Government, and he resigned the chancellorship, which he had held since the fall of <a href="15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>. The situation was too strained to last, and the end came through the death of <a href="15554a.htm">Archbishop Warham</a> in August, 1532. In the appointment of Cranmer as his successor, the king <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> that he had secured a subservient tool who desired nothing better than to see the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority overthrown. Anne Boleyn was then <em>enceinte</em>, and the king, relying, no doubt, on what Cranmer when <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> would be ready to do for him, went through a form of <a href="09691b.htm">marriage</a> with her on 25 January, 1533. On 15 April Cranmer received <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. On 23 May, Parliament having meanwhile forbidden all appeals to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Cranmer pronounced Henry's former <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a> invalid. On 28 May he declared the <a href="09691b.htm">marriage</a> with Anne valid. On 1 June Anne was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a>, and on 7 September she gave birth to a daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth. <a href="04024a.htm">Clement</a>, who had previously sent to Henry more than one monition upon his desertion of Catherine, issued a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on 11 July, declaring, also, his <a href="05054c.htm">divorce</a> and remarriage null. In <a href="05431b.htm">England</a> Catherine was deprived of her title of Queen, and Mary her daughter was treated as a <a href="07650a.htm">bastard</a>. Much sympathy was aroused among the populace, to meet which severe measures were taken against the more conspicuous of the disaffected, particularly the <a href="02319b.htm">"Nun of Kent"</a>, who claimed to have had <a href="13005a.htm">revelations</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> displeasure at the recent course of events.</p>

<p>In the course of the next year the breach with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was completed. Parliament did all that was required of it. <a href="01537b.htm">Annates</a>, <a href="11774a.htm">Peter's Pence</a>, and other payments to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> were finally abolished. An Act of Succession entailed the crown on the children of Anne Boleyn, and an <a href="11177a.htm">oath</a> was drawn up to be exacted of every <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of lawful age. It was the refusal to take this <a href="11177a.htm">oath</a>, the preamble of which declared Henry's <a href="09707a.htm">marriage</a> with Catherine null from the beginning, which sent <a href="14689c.htm">More</a> and <a href="08462b.htm">Fisher</a> to the Tower, and eventually to the block. A certain number of <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, <a href="02785a.htm">Brigittines</a>, and <a href="06281a.htm">Observant Franciscans</a> imitated their firmness and shared their <a href="05793a.htm">fate</a>. All these have been <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> in modern times by <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>. There were, however, but a handful who were thus <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> to their convictions. Declarations were obtained from the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in both <a href="12514a.htm">provinces</a> "that the <a href="12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> hath no greater <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> conferred upon him by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in this kingdom of <a href="05431b.htm">England</a> than any other foreign <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>", while Parliament, in November, declared the king "Supreme Head of the Church of England", and shortly afterwards Cromwell, a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>, was appointed <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to rule the <a href="01498a.htm">English Church</a> in the king's name. Though the people were cowed, these measures were not carried out without much disaffection, and, to stamp out any overt expression of this, Cromwell and his master now embarked upon a veritable reign of terror. The <a href="05474a.htm">martyrs</a> already referred to were most of them brought to the scaffold in the course of 1535, but fourteen <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> also suffered death by burning in the same year. There followed a <a href="15479a.htm">visitation</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, unscrupulous instruments like Layton, Legh, and Price being appointed for the purpose. They played, of course, into the king's hand and compiled <em>comperta</em> abounding in charges of disgraceful <a href="14004b.htm">immorality</a>, which have been shown to be at least grossly exaggerated. In pursuance of the same policy Parliament, in February, 1536, acting under great pressure, voted to the king the <a href="12466a.htm">property</a> of all <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> with less than 200 pounds a year of annual income, recommending that the inmates should be transferred to the larger houses where "<a href="12738a.htm">religion</a> happily was right well observed." The dissolution, when carried out, produced much popular resentment, especially in <a href="09266b.htm">Lincolnshire</a> and the northern counties. Eventually, in the autumn of 1536, the people banded together in a very formidable insurrection known as the <a href="12084b.htm">Pilgrimage of Grace</a>. The insurgents rallied under the device of the <a href="15714a.htm">Five Wounds</a>, and they were only induced to disperse by the deceitful promises of Henry's representative, the <a href="11101b.htm">Duke of Norfolk</a>. The suppression of the larger <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> rapidly followed, and with these were swept away numberless shrines, <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a>, and objects of <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="05188b.htm">veneration</a>, on the pretext that these were purely <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a>. It is easy to see that the <a href="09438a.htm">lust</a> of plunder was the motive which prompted this wholesale confiscation. (<em>See</em> <a href="10455a.htm">S<font size=-2>UPPRESSION OF THE</font> M<font size=-2>ONASTERIES</font></a>.)</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Meanwhile, Henry, though taking advantage of the spirit of religious innovation now rife among the people whenever it suited his purpose, remained still attached to the <a href="13295a.htm">sacramental</a> system in which he had been brought up. In 1539 the Statute of the Six Articles enforced, under the severest penalties, such doctrines as <a href="05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a>, <a href="04175a.htm">Communion under one kind</a>, <a href="11618c.htm">auricular confession</a>, and the <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>. Under this act offenders were sent to the stake for their <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> just as ruthlessly as the aged <a href="09656b.htm">Margaret, Countess of Salisbury</a>, was <a href="02059c.htm">attainted</a> by Parliament and eventually beheaded, simply because Henry was irritated by the denunciations of her son <a href="12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>. Neither was the king less cruel towards those who were nearest to him. Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, his second and fifth wives, perished on the scaffold, but their whilom lord only paraded his indifference regarding the fate to which he had condemned them. On 30 July, 1540, of six victims who were dragged to Smithfield, three were <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> burnt for <a href="07256b.htm">heretical doctrine</a>, and the other three <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, hanged and quartered for denying the king's supremacy. Of all the numerous miserable beings whom Henry sent to <a href="12565a.htm">execution</a>, Cromwell, perhaps, is the only one who fully deserved his fate. Looking at the last fifteen years of Henry's life, it is hard to find one single feature which does not evoke repulsion, and the attempts made by some writers to whitewash his misdeeds only give <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the extraordinary prejudice with which they approach the subject. Henry's cruelties continued to the last, and so likewise did his inconsistencies. One of the last measures of confiscation of his reign was an act of suppression of <a href="03573c.htm">chantries</a>, but Henry by his last will and testament established what were practically <a href="03573c.htm">chantries</a> to have <a href="10006a.htm">Masses</a> said for his own <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>
