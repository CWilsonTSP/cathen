<p>Date of birth unknown; died after 385 or 386. He belongs to the group known as the "Cappadocian Fathers", a title which reveals at once his birthplace in <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and his <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> characteristics. Gregory was born of a deeply religious <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, not very rich in worldly goods, to which circumstances he probably owed the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> training of his youth. His mother Emmelia was a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr's</a> daughter; two of his brothers, Basil of C&aelig;sarea and <a href="11773c.htm">Peter of Sebaste</a>, became <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> like himself; his eldest sister, Macrina, became a model of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and is <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint. Another brother, Naucratius, a lawyer, inclined to a life of asceticism, but died too young to realize his desires. A letter of Gregory to his younger brother, Peter, exhibits the feelings of lively gratitude which both cherished for their elder brother Basil, whom Gregory calls "our father and our master". Probably, therefore, the difference in years between them was such as to have enabled Basil to supervise the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of his younger brothers. Basil's training was an antidote to the lessons of the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, wherein, as we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> from a letter of <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, Gregory of Nyssa spent some time, very probably in his early youth, for it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that while still a youth Gregory exercised the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office of <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. His <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, it would seem, had endeavoured to turn his thoughts towards the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, for when the young man chose a secular career and began the study of rhetoric, Basil remonstrated with him long and earnestly; when he had failed he called on Gregory's friends to influence him against that objectionable secular calling. It was all in vain; moreover, it would seem that the young man married. There exists a letter addressed to him by <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> condoling with him on the loss of one Theosebeia, who must have been his wife, and with whom he continued to live, as with a sister, even after he became <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This is also evident from his treatise "De virginitate".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Some think that Gregory spent a certain time in retreat before his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but we have no <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the fact. His extant letters make no mention of such retirement from the world. Nor are we better informed of the circumstances of his election to the <a href="11172c.htm">See of Nyssa</a>, a little town on the banks of the Halys, along the road between C&aelig;sarea and <a href="01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>. According to <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> it was Basil who performed the episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of his brother, before he himself had taken possession of the See of Sozima; which would place the beginning of Gregory of Nyssa's episcopate about 371. Was this brusque change in Gregory's career the result of a sudden vocation? <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> tells us that it was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to overcome his brother's repugnance, before he accepted the office of <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But this does not help us to an answer, as the episcopal charge in that day was beset with many dangers. Moreover in the fourth century, and even later, it was not uncommon to express dislike of the episcopal <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, and to fly from the prospect of election. The fugitives, however, were usually discovered and brought back, and the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place when a show of resistance had saved the candidate's <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>. Whether it was so in Gregory's case, or whether he really did feel his own unfitness, we do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>. In any case, St. Basil seems to have regretted at times the constraint thus put on his brother, now removed from his influence; in his letters he complains of Gregory's naive and clumsy interference with his (Basil's) business. To Basil the synod called in 372 by Gregory at <a href="01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> seemed the ruin of his own labours. In 375 Gregory seemed to him decidedly incapable of ruling a Church. At the same time he had but faint praise for Gregory's <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p>On arriving in his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> Gregory had to face great difficulties. His sudden elevation may have turned against him some who had hoped for the office themselves. It would appear that one of the courtiers of <a href="15253b.htm">Emperor Valens</a> had solicited the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> either for himself or one of his friends. When Demosthenes, Governor of <a href="12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, convened an assembly of Eastern <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, a certain Philocares, at one of its sessions, accused Gregory of wasting <a href="12466a.htm">church property</a>, and of irregularity in his election to the episcopate, whereupon Demosthenes ordered the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11172c.htm">Nyssa</a> to be seized and brought before him. Gregory at first allowed himself to be led away by his captors, then losing heart and discouraged by the cold and brutal treatment he met with, he took an opportunity of escape and reached a place of safety. A Synod of <a href="11172c.htm">Nyssa</a> (376) deposed him, and he was reduced to wander from town to town, until the death of <a href="15253b.htm">Valens</a> in 378. The new emperor, Gratian, published an edict of tolerance, and Gregory returned to his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, where he was received with <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a>. A few months after this (January, 379) his brother Basil died; whereupon an era of activity began for Gregory. In 379 he assisted at the Council of Antioch which had been summoned because of the Meletian <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Soon after this, it is supposed, he visited Palestine. There is reason for <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> that he was sent officially to remedy the disorders of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Arabia. But possibly his journey did not take place till after the Council of Constantinople in 381, convened by <a href="14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> for the welfare of religion in that city. It asserted the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of Nic&aelig;a, and tried to put an end to <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and <a href="12174a.htm">Pneumatism</a> in the East. This council was not looked on as an important one at the time; even those present at it seldom refer to it in their writings. Gregory himself, though he assisted at the council, mentions it only casually in his funeral oration over <a href="10161b.htm">Meletius of Antioch</a>, who died during the course of this assembly.</p>

<p>An edict of <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> (30 July, 381; Cod. Theod., LXVI, tit. I., L. 3) having appointed certain <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> as centres of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion in the East, Helladius of C&aelig;sarea, Gregory of Nyssa and Otreius of <a href="10166a.htm">Melitene</a> were chosen to fill them. At Constantinople Gregory gave evidence on two occasions of his talent as an orator; he delivered the discourse at the <a href="05479c.htm">enthronization</a> of <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, also the aforesaid oration over <a href="10161b.htm">Meletius of Antioch</a>. It is very probable that Gregory was present at another Council of Constantinople in 383; his "Oratio de deitate Filii et Spiritus Sancti" seems to confirm this. In 385 or 386 he preached the funeral sermon over the imperial Princess Pulcheria, and shortly afterwards over Empress Flaccilla. A little later we meet him again at Constantinople, on which occasion his counsel was sought for the repression of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> disorders in Arabia; he then disappears from history, and probably did not long survive this journey. From the above it will be seen that his life is little known to us. It is difficult to outline clearly his <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>, while his writings contain too many flights of eloquence to permit final judgment on his real character.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Works</h2>

<h3>Exegetical</h3>

<p>Most of his writings treat of the <a href="../bible.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. He was an ardent admirer of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and applied constantly the latter's principles of <a href="07271a.htm">hermeneutics</a>. Gregory is ever in quest of allegorical interpretations and mystical meanings hidden away beneath the literal sense of texts. As a rule, however, the "great Cappadocians" tried to eliminate this tendency. His "Treatise on the Work of the Six Days" follows St. Basil's Hex&aelig;meron. Another work, "On the Creation of Man", deals with the work of the Sixth Day, and contains some curious anatomical details; it was translated into Latin by <a href="05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a>. His account of Moses as legislator offers much fine-spun allegorizing, and the same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of his "Explanation of the Titles of the Psalms". In a brief tractate on the <a href="15674a.htm">witch</a> of Endor he says that the <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> did not see Samuel, but only a <a href="04710a.htm">demon</a>, who put on the figure of the <a href="12477a.htm">prophet</a>. Besides a <a href="07448a.htm">homily</a> on the sixth Psalm, he wrote eight <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> on Ecclesiastes, in which he taught that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> should rise above the senses, and that <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> peace is only to be found in contempt of worldly greatness. He is also the author of fifteen <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the Canticle of Canticles (the union of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> with its Creator), five very eloquent <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the <a href="09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, and eight highly rhetorical <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the Beatitudes.</p>

<h3>Theological</h3>

<p>In <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> Gregory shows himself more original and more at ease. Yet his originality is purely in manner, since he added little that is new. His diction, however, offers many felicitous and pleasing allusions, suggested probably by his mystical turn of mind. These grave studies were taken up by him late in life, hence he follows step by step the teaching of St. Basil and of <a href="07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a>. Like them he defends the unity of the Divine nature and the trinity of Persons; where he loses their guidance, our confidence in him tends to decrease. In his teaching on the Eucharist he appears really original; his <a href="14597a.htm">Christological</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, however, is based entirely on <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> and <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>. The most important of his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writings is his large "Catechesis", or "Oratio Catechetica", an argumentative defence in forty chapters of <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> as against <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="11388a.htm">heathens</a>, and <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The most extensive of his extant works is his refutation of <a href="05605a.htm">Eunomius</a> in twelve books, a defence of St. Basil against that <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and also of the <a href="11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> against <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>; this work is of capital importance in the history of the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversy. He also wrote two works against Apollinaris of <a href="08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, in refutation of the <a href="07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> of that writer, viz. that the body of Christ descended from <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and that in Christ, the Divine Word acted as the rational <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. Among the works of Gregory are certain "Opuscula" on the Trinity addressed to Ablabius, the tribune Simplicius, and <a href="05628b.htm">Eustathius of Sebaste</a>. He wrote also against Arius and Sabellius, and against the Macedonians, who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit; the latter work he never finished. In the "De anima et resurrectione" we have a dialogue between Gregory and his deceased sister, Macrina; it treats of death, <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, and our last end. He defends human liberty against the fatalism of the <a href="02018e.htm">astrologers</a> in a work "On Fate", and in his treatise "On Children", dedicated to Hieros, Prefect of Cappadocia, he undertook to explain why Providence permits the premature death of children.</p>

<h3>Ascetical</h3>

<p>He wrote also on <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life and conduct, e.g. "On the meaning of the Christian name or profession", addressed to Harmonius, and "On Perfection and what manner of man the Christian should be", dedicated to the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> Olympius. For the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, he wrote a work on the Divine purpose in creation. His admirable book "On Virginity", written about 370, was composed to strengthen in all who read it the desire for a life of perfect <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<h3>Sermons and homilies</h3>

<p>Gregory wrote also many sermons and <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a>, some of which we have already mentioned; others of importance are his panegyric on St. Basil, and his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> on the Divinity of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>

<p>A few of his letters (twenty-six) have survived; two of them offer a peculiar interest owing to the severity of his strictures on contemporary <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>For a discussion of his peculiar <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the general restoration (Apocatastasis) to divine favour of all <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a> creatures at the end of time, i.e. the temporary nature of the pains of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a>, see the articles <a href="01599a.htm">APOCATASTASIS</a> and MIVART. The theory of interpolation of the writings of Gregory and of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, sustained among others by Vincenzi (below), seems, in this respect at least, both useless and gratuitous (Bardenhewer).</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The writings of Gregory are best collected in <em>P.G.</em>, XLIV-XLVI. There is no critical edition as yet, though one was begun by FORBES and OEHLER (Burntisland, 1855, 61); of another edition planned by Oehler, only one volume appeared (Halle, 1865). The best of the earlier editions is that of FRONTO DUC&AElig;US (Paris, 1615). Cf. VINCENZI, <em>In Gregorii Nysseni et Origenis scripta et doctrinam nova recensio</em>, etc. (Rome, 1864-69); BAUER, <em>Die Trostreden des Gregorios von Nyssa in ihrem Verh&auml;ltniss zur antiken Rhetorik</em> (Marburg, 1892); BOU&Euml;DRON, <em>Doctrines philosophiques de Saint Gr&eacute;goire de Nysse</em> (Nantes, 1861); KOCH, <em>Das mystische Schauen beim hl. Gr. v. Nyssa in Theol. Quartalschrift</em> (1898), LXXX, 397-420; DIEKAMP, <em>Die Gotteslehre des hl. Gregor von Nyssa: ein Beitrag zur Dogmengesch. der patristischen Zeit</em> (M&uuml;nster, 1897); WEISS, <em>Die Erziehungslehre der Kappadozier</em> (Freiburg, 1903); HILT, <em>St. Gregorii episcopi Nysseni doctrina de angelis exposita</em> (Freiburg, 1860); KRAMPF, <em>Der Urzustand des Menschen nach der Lehre des hl. Gregor von Nyssa, eine dogmatisch-patristische Studie</em> (W&uuml;rzburg, 1889); REICHE, <em>Die kunstlerischen Elemente in der Welt und Lebens-Anschauung des Gregor von Nyssa</em> (Jena, 1897); and on the large <em>Catechesis</em> (<em>logos katechetikos ho megas</em>), generally known as <em>Oratio Catechetica</em>, see SRAWLEY in <em>Journal of Theol. Studies</em> (1902), III, 421-8, also his new edition of the <em>Oratio</em> (Cambridge, 1903). For an English version of several works of Gregory see <em>Library of Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers</em>, second series (New York, 1893), II, v; and for a German version of some works, HAYD in the <em>Kemptener Bibliothek der Kirchenv&auml;ter</em> (1874).</p></div>
