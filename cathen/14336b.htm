<p>The Supernatural Order is the ensemble of effects exceeding the powers of the created <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> and gratuitously produced by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for the purpose of raising the <a href="12673b.htm">rational</a> creature above its native sphere to a God-like life and destiny. The meaning of the phrase fluctuates with that of its antithesis, the natural order. Those who conceive the latter as the world of material beings to the exclusion of immaterial entities, or as the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> mechanism of <a href="03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect to the exclusion of the free agency of the will, or again as the inherent forces of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> to the exclusion of the extrinsic concurrence of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, quite consistently call supernatural all spiritual facts or <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> determinations or Divine operations. There is no objection to that way of speaking provided the assertion of the supernatural so understood be not made, by a fallacious transference of meaning, to screen the negation of the supernatural as defined above. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> sometimes call supernatural the <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> way in which certain effects, in themselves natural, are produced, or certain endowments (like man's immunity from death, suffering, passion, and <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a>) that bring the lower class up to the higher though always within the limits of the created, but they are careful in qualifying the former as accidentally supernatural (<em>supernaturale per accidens</em>) and the latter as relatively supernatural (<em>pr&oelig;ternaturale</em>). For a concept of the substantially and absolutely supernatural, they start from a comprehensive view of the natural order taken, in its amplest acceptation, for the aggregate of all created entities and powers, including the highest natural endowments of which the <a href="12673b.htm">rational</a> creature is capable, and even such Divine operations as are demanded by the effective carrying out of the cosmic order. The supernatural order is then more than a <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> way of producing natural effects, or a notion of relative superiority within the created world, or the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> concurrence of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>; it is an effect or series of effects substantially and absolutely above all nature and, as such, calls for an exceptional intervention and gratuitous bestowal of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and rises in a manner to the Divine order, the only one that transcends the whole created world. Although some <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> do not consider impossible the elevation of the irrational creature to the Divine order, v. g., by way of personal union, nevertheless it stands to reason that such an exalted privilege should be reserved for the <a href="12673b.htm">rational</a> creature capable of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. It is obvious also that this uplifting of the <a href="12673b.htm">rational</a> creature to the supernatural order cannot be by way of absorption of the created into the Divine or of fusion of both into a sort of <a href="10483a.htm">monistic</a> identity, but only by way of union or participation, the two terms remaining perfectly distinct.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Not being an a priori conception but a positive fact, the supernatural order can only be known through <a href="13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> properly supported by such Divine evidences as <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a>, prophecy, etc. Revelation and its evidences are called extrinsic and auxiliary supernatural, the elevation itself retaining the name of intrinsic or, according to some, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> supernatural. There are three principal instances of such elevation:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>The <a href="07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> or the assumption of the Sacred Humanity of Christ into the personal dignity of the <a href="14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</li><li>The calling of the <a href="01476d.htm">faithful angels</a> to the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> whereby they see always the face of the Father who is in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs10">Matthew 18:10</a>), and</li><li>The elevation of man to the state of grace here and glory hereafter.</li></ol></div>

<p>The <a href="07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> and the <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> supernatural are both closely connected with our own elevation. From St. John (i, 12-14) we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> is the ideal and instrument of it, and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> declares that the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> are "all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs14">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Leaving for separate treatment the auxiliary supernatural (<em>see</em> <a href="13001a.htm">R<font size=-2>EVELATION</font></a>; <a href="10338a.htm">M<font size=-2>IRACLE</font></a>; <a href="12473a.htm">P<font size=-2>ROPHECY</font></a>), the <a href="07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="07706b.htm">I<font size=-2>NCARNATION</font></a>), and the <a href="01476d.htm">angels'</a> elevation (<em>see</em> <a href="01476d.htm">A<font size=-2>NGELS</font></a>), this article deals with the supernatural order in man both in its history and analysis.</p>

<p>Briefly, the history is this: From the beginning, man was raised, far above the claims of his nature, to a life which made him, even here below, the adopted child of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and to a destiny which entitled him to the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. To these strictly supernatural <a href="06553a.htm">gifts</a> by which man was truly made partaker of the Divine nature (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs4">2 Peter 1:4</a>) were added preternatural endowments, that is immunity from <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, passion, suffering and death, which left him "little lower than the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>" (<a href="../bible/psa008.htm#vrs6">Psalm 8:6</a>; <a href="../bible/heb002.htm#vrs7">Hebrews 2:7</a>). Through their own fault, our <a href="01129a.htm">first parents</a> forfeited for themselves and their race both the God-like life and destiny and the angel-like endowments. In His mercy <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> promised a Redeemer who, heralded by ages of prophecy, came in the fulness of time in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the incarnate <a href="14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. By His Incarnation, labours, passion, and death, <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> restored <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> to its former Divine sonship and heavenly inheritance, if not to its quasi-angelic prerogatives, the virtue of Redemption being applied to us through the joint ministrations of the inner Spirit, and of the visible Church, in the form of actual helps, habitual <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and the power of meriting <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</p>

<p>An analysis of the supernatural order, barely inaugurated by the Fathers, but brought to a point of great perfection by the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> and post-Tridentine <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, discloses the various elements that make up order, that is an end, means, and <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>. The end is man's destination to <a href="02364a.htm">see God face to face</a> and to <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> Him correspondingly. If, as will be shown, the <a href="02364a.htm">intuitive vision of God</a> is our <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> destiny and moreover transcends our highest natural powers, then we must be given means capable of attaining that end, that is supernatural. Those means can be no other than our own actions, but invested with a higher power that makes them meritorious of <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. Grace, both actual and habitual, is the source of that meriting power: while habitual grace, with its train of infused virtues or faculties raises our mode of being and operating to a sphere which is <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> own, <a href="06689x.htm">actual grace</a> spurs us on to justification and, once we stand justified, sets in motion our supernatural powers causing them to yield good and meritorious works. In the supernatural order, as in all others, there are also specific <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>. The work of man's sanctification depends in a manner on the general <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> and most certainly upon the carrying out of all the moral <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> written in our hearts. Besides these <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> which Christ came not to abolish, there are positive or freely established enactments ranging all the way from the Divinely appointed conditions of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the revealed <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> and even the rules governing our growth in <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Glory and grace, being the central features of the supernatural order, special reference will be made to them both in the exposition of <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> and the establishment of the <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section1">Errors</h2>

<p>The theories denying or belittling the supernatural order may be classified from the standpoint of both their historical appearance and <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> sequence, into three groups according as they view the supernatural;</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>In our present <em>de facto</em> condition,</li><li>In the original status of man,</li><li>In its possibility and evidences.</li></ol></div>

<p>To the first group belong <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> and Semipelagianism. Influenced, no doubt, by the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoic</a> ideal and their own ascetic performances, the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> of the fifth century so magnified the capacity of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> as to pronounce natural to it both the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> and the <a href="01115a.htm">human acts</a> by which it is merited. They were condemned by the Councils of <a href="10304b.htm">Mileve</a> and Carthage, 418. Less daring, the Semipelagians, censured by the Council of Orange (529), subtracted from the supernatural only certain phases of man's life as the beginning of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>. To this group belong also, in a manner, the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> mystics of the fourteenth century, the <a href="02389c.htm">Beghards</a> condemned by the Council of Vienne (1312), for claiming that the <a href="12673b.htm">rational</a> creature possesses beatitude in itself without the help of the <em>lumen glori&oelig;</em> and <a href="05274a.htm">Eckhart</a>, whose identification of the Creator and the creature in the act of contemplation was censured by <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in 1329.</p>

<p>To the second group belong the early <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> and the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist School</a>, though in different degrees. Misinterpreting the still imperfect terminology of the Fathers who called natural, in the sense of original, the elevation of our <a href="01129a.htm">first parents</a>, the early <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> held that, according to Patristic teaching and contrarily to the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>, that elevation was not supernatural. Their <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, rejected by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. V, decretum de peccato originali, can. 1), was taken up again, but in a more refined form, by <a href="02209c.htm">Baius</a> who, indeed, designated as supernatural man's original condition but nullified the meaning of the word by stating that our first parent's elevation was demanded by and due to the normal condition of humanity. In spite of his condemnation by <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 9th ed., nn. 901, 903, 906, 922) he was followed by the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> and the pseudo-Synod of Pistoia, the former censured by <a href="04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, nn. 1249, 1250) and the latter by <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, nn. 1379, 1380, 1383). A confusion between the moral and the supernatural order, frequently found in the <a href="02209c.htm">Baianist</a> and <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> writings, was reproduced more or less consciously by some German <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> like Stattler, <a href="07276c.htm">Hermes</a>, Gunther, Hirsh, <a href="08703a.htm">Kuhn</a>, etc., who admitted the supernatural character of the other gifts but contended that the adoption to eternal life and the partaking of the Divine nature, being a moral necessity, could not be supernatural. That revival of an old <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> found a strong and successful opponent in <a href="08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a> in the second volume of his <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> on the supernatural.</p>

<p>To the third group belongs the <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalist</a> School from <a href="14113a.htm">Socinus</a> to the present <a href="10415a.htm">Modernists</a>. While the foregoing <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> proceeded less from a direct denial than from a confusion of the supernatural with the natural order, the <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalist</a> <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> rejects it in its entirety, on the plea of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> impossibility or critical non-existence. The Syllabus of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and the Vatican Constitution "De fide catholica" (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 1655) checked for a while that radical <a href="10713a.htm">Naturalism</a> which, however, has reappeared lately in a still more virulent form with <a href="10415a.htm">Modernism</a>. While there is nothing common between <a href="13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> and the present <a href="10415a.htm">Modernists</a>, he may, all unwittingly, have paved the way for them in the following vaguely Subjectivist proposition: "The supernatural order consists in the manifestation of Being in the plenitude of its reality, and the effect of that manifestation is a God-like sentiment, inchoate in this life through the light of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and grace, consummate in the next through the light of glory" (36th <a href="13194b.htm">Rosminian</a> proposition condemned by the Holy Office, 14 Dec., 1887). Preserving the dogmatic formul&aelig; while voiding them of their contents, the <a href="10415a.htm">Modernists</a> constantly speak of the supernatural, but they understand thereby the advanced stages of an evolutive process of the religious sentiment. There is no room in their system for the objective and revealed supernatural: their <a href="01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a> declares it unknowable, their Immanentism derives it from our own vitality, their symbolism explains it in term of subjective experience and their criticism declares non-authentic the documents used to prove it. "There is no question now," says <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, in his <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" of 8 Sept., 1907, "of the old <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> by which a sort of right to the supernatural was claimed for <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>. We have gone far beyond that. We have reached the point where it is affirmed that our most <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> religion, in the man Christ as in us, emanated from nature spontaneously and entirely. Than this, there is surely nothing more destructive of the whole supernatural order."</p>

<h2 id="section2">Catholic doctrine</h2>

<p>From the above documents, it may be summarized in three points: (1) The fact of man's elevation to grace and glory as against the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian error</a>; (2) the supernatural character of that elevation as against the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> theory; and (3) as against <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, its possibility and the validity of its credentials.</p>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>The fact of man's elevation, probably alluded to in the likeness of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> imprinted in Adam (<a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs26">Genesis 1:26</a>), in the tree of life from which he was barred in consequence of his <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs22">Genesis 3:22</a>), and in the intimate union of man with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, as described in the Sapiential and Prophetic books, has its full expression in the discourses of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm">John 6</a> and <a href="../bible/joh014.htm">14</a>-<a href="../bible/joh017.htm">17</a>), in the prologue of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> compared with <a href="../bible/joh002.htm">John 2</a> and <a href="../bible/joh003.htm">3</a>, and in the introduction to several Epistles like <a href="../bible/1co000.htm">1 Corinthians</a>, <a href="../bible/eph000.htm">Ephesians</a>, and <a href="../bible/1pe000.htm">1 Peter</a>. The direct and face-to-face <a href="02364a.htm">vision of God</a> is our future destiny (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs2">1 John 3:2</a>). In this world we are not in name only but in very fact the sons of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs1">1 John 3:1</a>), being born anew (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs7">1 John 3:7</a>) and having the charity of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> infused in our hearts by the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> who is given to us (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs5">Romans 5:5</a>). The emphasis laid by the early Fathers on man's deification has been shown elsewhere (<em>see</em> <a href="01147a.htm">A<font size=-2>DOPTION</font></a>). In view of all this it is not <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that the Fathers had not even a name to designate the supernatural, as is often asserted by modern critics. De Broglie (Le surnaturel, p. 45) shows that there were at least four different phrases to express the <a href="06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>: <em>hyper physin</em> (above nature), adscititia (superadded), <em>exothen tes ousias</em> (foreign to the essence), <em>charis, charismata</em> (gratuitous).</p>

<p>The gratuitous or supernatural character of the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> was placed in bold relief by <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#vrs15">1 Timothy 6:15</a>) and St. John (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs18">1:18</a> and <a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs46">6:46</a>). <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> merely paraphrases their teaching in the famous sentence: "Homo a se non videt Deum; ille autem volens videtur hominibus quibus vult, quando vult, quemadmodum vult; potens est enim in omnibus Deus" (Contra h&aelig;res., v, 20). Neither can one read such passages as <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs16">Ephesians 1:16-19</a> and <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#vrs14">3:14-21</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs10">Colossians 1:10 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs4">2 Peter 1:4</a>; etc., without realizing that the supernatural character of the <a href="08082b.htm">intuitive</a> vision applies likewise to present charity "which surpasses all <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>". The transcendence of the supernatural order, not only above our present <em>de facto</em> condition, but also above our native constitution viewed philosophically in the elements and properties and exigencies of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>, is not emphasized in <a href="06001a.htm">early Christian literature</a>, which deals not with abstractions. <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, however, describing the r&ocirc;le of the Redeemer which is to renovate, repair, and restore, comes very near the point by hinting that our present, clearly supernatural elevation is but a return to the no less supernatural condition of the "old Adam"; and while the point is not fully discussed by the Fathers before the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> controversies concerning <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>, yet some passing remarks by <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> (Contra h&aelig;res., III, xviii, 1, 2) and <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> (X Homily on St. John, 2) show that there is no chasm between the early Fathers, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who presented a bold, if not finished, delineation of the supernatural as such, and the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> and post-Tridentine <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> (as <a href="14152a.htm">Soto</a>, "De natura et gratia"; <a href="13062b.htm">Ripalda</a>, "De ente supernaturali"; Francisco Su&aacute;rez, "De variis statibus") who carefully distinguished the various states of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>. <a href="13062b.htm">Ripalda's</a> opinion to the effect that the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> which is <em>de facto</em> supernatural to the whole actual creation might become natural to some possible higher creature, has never been formally condemned by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; it is however unanimously rejected by <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, as it seems less conformable to Scriptural sayings and tends to destroy the absolute transcendence of the supernatural order.</p>

<p>The <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> possibility and the critical ascertainment of the supernatural order are the central point of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="01618a.htm">apologetics</a>. Against the prejudicial views of the <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> who pronounce it inexistent, or unnecessary, or mischievous, or even impossible, <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> apologists urge, and to good purpose, the critical value of the records on which it rests, its quasi-necessity for the correct conduct of life, the profits it brings to its recipients, and the utter want of foundation of its so-called antinomies. Having thus cleared the ground, they proceed to collect and interpret and organize the various data of Revelation, the result being a harmonious and truly grandiose system of overlife. From the commonly received axiom that "grace does not destroy but only perfects nature" they establish between the two orders a parallelism that is not mutual confusion or reciprocal exclusion, but distinction and subordination. The <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> spoke freely of nature's possibilities (<em>potentia obedientialis</em>) and even conations (<em>appetitus naturalis</em>) towards the supernatural. To those traditional methods and views some <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers have, of late, endeavoured to add and even substitute another theory which, they claim, will bring the supernatural home to the modern mind and give it unquestionable credentials. The novel theory consists in making nature postulate the supernatural. Whatever be the legitimity of the purpose, the method is ambiguous and full of pitfalls. Between the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen's</a> <em>potentia obedientialis</em> and <em>appetitus moralis</em> and the <a href="10415a.htm">Modernist</a> tenet according to which the supernatural "emanates from nature spontaneously and entirely" there is space and distance; at the same time, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01618a.htm">apologist</a> who would attempt to fill some of the space and cover some of the distance should keep in mind the admonition of <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> to those "Catholics who, while rejecting immanence as a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, employ it as a method of <a href="01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, and who do this so imprudently that they seem to admit that there is in <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> and rigorous necessity with regard to the supernatural order and not merely a capacity and suitability for the supernatural such as has at all times been emphasized by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apologists" (Encyclical "Pascendi").</p>
