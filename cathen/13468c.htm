<p>(CAESARAUGUSTANA)</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>; comprises a great part of the civil Province of Saragossa (Zaragoza). It is bounded on the north by Navarre and Huesca; on the east by Huesca, <a href="09188a.htm">L&eacute;rida</a>, and Tarragona; on the south by Valencia and Teruel; on the west by <a href="07042b.htm">Guadalajara</a> and Soria. The episcopal city, situated on the Ebro, has 72,000 inhabitants. Before the Roman period the site of Saragossa appears to have been occupied by Salduba, a little village of Edetania, within the boundaries of Celtiberia. Here in A.U.C. 727 <a href="02107a.htm">Octavius Augustus</a>, then in his seventh consulate, founded the colony of Caesar Augusta, giving it the Italian franchise and making it the capital of a juridical <em>conventus</em>. Pomponius Mela called it "the most illustrious of the inland cities of Hispania Tarraconensis." In A.D. 452 it fell under the power of the Suevian king Reciarius; in 466 under that of the <a href="15476b.htm">Visigoth</a> Euric. <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore</a> extolled it as one of the best cities of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the Gothic period, and Pacensis called it "the most ancient and most flourishing."</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is one of the oldest in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, for its origin dates back to the coming of the Apostle James &mdash; a fact of which there had never been any <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> until <a href="02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, influenced by a fabulous story of <a href="09316c.htm">Garc&iacute;a de Loaisa</a>, called it in question. <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> ordered the old lesson in the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a> dealing with this point to be restored (see <a href="04187b.htm">C<font size=-2>OMPOSTELA</font></a>). Closely involved with the tradition of St. James's coming to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and of the founding of the church of Saragossa, are those of Our Lady of the Pillar (see <a href="12083b.htm">N<font size=-2>UESTRA</font> S<font size=-2>E&Ntilde;ORA DEL</font> P<font size=-2>ILAR</font></a>) and of Sts. <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and Theodore, disciples of St. James, who are supposed to have been the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Saragossa. About the year 256 there appears as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> Felix Caesaraugustanus, who defended <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> discipline in the case of <a href="02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Martial, Bishops, respectively, of <a href="02018d.htm">Astorga</a> and <a href="10202a.htm">M&eacute;rida</a>. St. Valerius, who assisted at the Council of Iliberis, was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 290 to 315 and, together with his disciple and <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> St. Vincent, suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Dacian. It is believed that there had been <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> at Saragossa in previous persecutions as Prudentius seems to affirm; but no certain record is to be found of any before this time, when, too, St. Engratia and the "numberless <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>" (<em>santos innumerables</em>), as they are called, gained their crowns. It is said that Dacian, to detect and so make an end of all the faithful of Saragossa, ordered that liberty to practice their religion should be promised them on condition that they all went out of the city at a certain fixed time and by certain designated gates. As soon as they had thus gone forth, he ordered them to be put to the sword and their corpses burned. Their ashes were mixed with those of criminals, so that no veneration might be paid them. But a shower of rain fell and washed the ashes apart, forming those of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> into certain white masses. These, known as the "holy masses" (<em>las santas masas</em>) were deposited in the <a href="04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the church dedicated to St. Engratia, where they are still preserved.</p>

<p>St. Vincent was taken to <a href="15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, where he suffered a long and terrible <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. St. Valerius was exiled to a place called Enet, near <a href="02285b.htm">Barbastro</a>, where he died, and whence his <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> were translated first to Roda, the head and arm being brought thence to Saragossa when that city had been reconquered.</p>

<p>The See of Saragossa was occupied during the Gothic period by two illustrious <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>: <a href="02744b.htm">St. Braulius</a>, who assisted at the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Councils of Toledo; and Taj&oacute;n, famous for his own writings and for having discovered at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the third part of <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory's</a> "Morals." From 592 to 619 the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Maximus, who assisted at the Councils of Barcelona and Egara, and whose name, combined with that of the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> Marcus, has been used to form an alleged <a href="09672a.htm">Marcus Maximus</a>, the <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> continuator of Flavius Dexter. In 542, when the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a> laid siege to Saragossa to take vengeance for the wrongs of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princess, Clotilde, the besieged went forth in procession and delivered to the enemy, as the price of their raising the siege, a portion of the blood-stained stole of St. Vincent, the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>.</p>

<p>Before the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invasion three national councils were held at Saragossa. The first, earlier than those of Toledo, in 380, when Valerius II was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, had for its object the extirpation of Priscillianism; the second, in 592, in the episcopate of Maximus was against the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>; the third, under Bishop Valderedus, in 691, provided that queens, when <a href="15617c.htm">widowed</a>, should retire to some <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> for their security and for the sake of decorum. During the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracen</a> occupation the <a href="15710a.htm">Catholic worship</a> did not cease in this city; the churches of the Virgin and of St. Engratia were maintained, while that of the Saviour was turned into a mosque. Of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this unhappy period the names are preserved of Senior, who visited St. Eulogius at Cordoba (849), and of Eleca, who in 890 was driven from the city by the <a href="10424a.htm">Moslems</a> and took refuge at <a href="11363a.htm">Oviedo</a>. Paternus was sent by Sancho the Great to Cluny, to introduce the <a href="04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> reform into <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of S. Juan de la Pena and S. Salvador de Leyre, and was afterwards appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saragossa.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Alfonso I, the Fighter, of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, reconquered the city on 18 Dec., 1118, and named as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> Pedro de Librana, whose appointment was confirmed by Gelasius II. L&oacute;pez, in his "Historia de Zaragoza," says that Librana first resided at the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Pillar, and on 6 Jan., 1119, purified the great mosque, which he dedicated to the Saviour, and there established his <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. Hence the controversy which began in 1135, in the episcopate of Garc&iacute;a Guerra de Majones, between the canons of the Pillar and those of St. Saviour as to the title of <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.</p>

<p>In 1318 the See of Saragossa was made <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> by a grant of <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (14 June), Pedro L&oacute;pez de Luna being <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. For more than a century (1458-1577) princes of the royal blood occupied the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>: Juan of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, natural son of Juan II (1458); Alonso of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> (1478); another Juan of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> (1520); Fernando of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, who had been the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Veruela.</p>

<p>In the factions which followed upon the death of King Martin, Archbishop Garc&iacute;a Fern&aacute;ndez de Heredia was assassinated by Antonio de Luna, a partisan of the Count of <a href="15223b.htm">Urgel</a> (1411). In 1485 the first inquisitor-general, <a href="11772b.htm">St. Peter Arbues</a>, fell a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, slain by some relapsed <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were led by Juan de la Abadia.</p>

<p>The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is <a href="04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the Saviour, as it had been before the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> invasion. It shares its rank with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Nuestra Se&ntilde;or del Pilar, half of the chapter residing at each of the two churches, while the dean resides six months at each alternately. The building of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun by Pedro Tarrjao in the fourteenth century. In 1412 <a href="09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> caused a magnificent baldachinum to be erected, but one of its pillars fell down, and it was reduced to its present condition. In 1490 Archbishop Alonso of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> raised the two lateral <a href="10724a.htm">naves</a>, which had been lower, to an equal height with the central, and added two more; Fernando of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> added three other <a href="10724a.htm">naves</a> beyond the choir, to counterbalance the excessive width of the building, and thus, in 1550 was the Gothic edifice completed. The great <a href="03572b.htm">chancel</a> and choir were built by order of Archbishop Dalmau de Mury Cervell&oacute;n (1431-58). In the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of S. Dominguito del Val are preserved the relics of that saint, a boy of seven who was crucified by the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> in 1250. The <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and beside it rises the tower, more modern than the body of the church, having been begun in 1790.</p>

<p>The <a href="02081a.htm">Church</a> of Nuestra Se&ntilde;or del Pilar is believed to have originated in a <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> built by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostle</a> James. Bishop Librana found it almost in ruins and appealed to the charity of all the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> to rebuild it. At the close of the thirteenth century four <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> again stirred up the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> to repair the building, which was preserved until the end of the seventeenth century. In 1681 work was commenced on the new church, the first stone being laid by Archbishop Diego de Castrillo, 25 July, 1685. This grandiose edifice, 500 ft. (about 457 English feet) in length, covers the <em>capella angelica</em>, where the celebrated image of the Blessed Virgin is <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a>. Though the style of the building is not of the best period, attention is attracted by its exterior, its multitude of <a href="04569d.htm">cupolas</a>, which are reflected in the waters of the Ebro, giving it a character all its own.</p>

<p>Saragossa possesses many very noteworthy churches. Among them are that of St. Engratia, built on the spot where the victims of Dacian were <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a>. It was destroyed in the War of Independence, only the <a href="04558a.htm">crypt</a> and the doorway being left; a few years ago, however, it was rebuilt, and now serves as a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church. The <a href="13470a.htm">University of Saragossa</a> obtained from <a href="03625a.htm">Carlos I</a> (the <a href="03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>) in 1542, the privileges accorded to others in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Its importance was afterwards promoted by Pedro Cerduna, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14452a.htm">Tarazona</a>; he gave it a building which lasted until it was blown up by the French in 1808. A separate building has been erected for the faculties of medicine and <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace is a splendid edifice erected by Archbishop Agustin de Lezo y Palomeque. There are two <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>: that of Sts.
