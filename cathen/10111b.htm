<p>A medal may be defined to be a piece of metal, usually in the form of a coin, not used as money, but struck or cast for a commemorative purpose, and adorned with some appropriate effigy, device, or inscription. In the present article we are concerned only with religious medals. These are more varied even than secular medals, for they are produced not only to commemorate <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> (e.g. <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and the Saints), places (e.g. famous shrines) and past historical events (e.g. dogmatic definitions, <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>, dedications etc.) as well as personal <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> like First Communion, Ordination, etc., but they are also often concerned with the order of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> (e.g. they may recall the mysteries of our Faith, such as the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> or the Divine Attributes), they are used to inculcate lessons of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, are specially blessed to serve as badges of pious associations or to <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a> and protect the wearer, and finally are often enriched with <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a>.</p>

<h2>In the early Church</h2>

<p>It was at one time <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether anything in the nature of a purely devotional medal was known in the early ages of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Certain objects of this kind were described and figured by seventeenth-century writers on the <a href="03417b.htm">Catacombs</a>, and a few such were preserved in museums. All these; however, were regarded with much suspicion before the appearance of an epoch-making article by de Rossi in the "Bullettino di Archeologia, Cristiana" for 1869, since which time the question has been practically set at rest and the authenticity of some at least of these specimens has remained undisputed. A moment's consideration will establish the intrinsic probability of the existence of such objects. The use of amulets in <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> antiquity was widespread. The word <em>amuletum</em> itself occurs in Pliny, and many monuments show how talismans of this kind were worn around the neck by all classes. That the early Church should have found the abuse ineradicable and should have striven to counteract it by suggesting or tolerating some analogous practice of an innocent character, is in itself highly probable. Many parallel concessions of this kind might be quoted. The letter of <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> to <a href="10168b.htm">St. Mellitus</a> about the dedication of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a>, preserved to us by <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a> (Hist. Eccl., I, xxx), supplies perhaps the most famous example. Moreover we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that the same <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> sent to Theodolind, Queen of the Lombards, two phylacteria, &#151; the cases are still Preserved at Monza &#151; containing a <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="04529a.htm">True Cross</a> and a sentence from the Gospels, which her child Adulovald was to wear around his neck.</p>

<p>This, however, and the practice of wearing "encolpia", little pectoral crosses, lent itself to abuses when magical formulae began to be joined to <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> symbols, as was regularly the practice of the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>. Hence we find many of the fathers of the fourth and later centuries protesting more or less vigorously against these <a href="12046a.htm">phylacteries</a> (cf. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, "In Matt.", iv, 33; P.L., XXVI, 174). But that <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of good name did wear such objects of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> around their necks is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a>, and it is consequently probable that <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> devices, should have been cast in metal for a similar purpose. In Africa (see "Bullettino di Arch. Crist.", 1891), the moulds have been found in which little crosses were cast with rings to hang them by. It follows therefore that certain coin-like objects, for which there exists good evidence of their being actually discovered in the <a href="03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> must be regarded as genuine relics of the devotional practices of the early Church. Two or three of these are specially famous. One, which de Rossi attributes to the close of the fourth century, bears upon both faces the legend <em>Successa Vivas</em>, an "acclamation" which probably indicates that the medal was cast for a certain Successa to commemorate, perhaps, her dedication to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. On one side we see represented the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of a <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, presumably <a href="09089a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, who is being roasted upon a gridiron in the presence of the Roman magistrate. The <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> character of the scene is shown by the <em>chi-rho</em> chrisma, the <em>alpha</em> and <em>omega</em>, and the <a href="09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown. On the reverse is depicted a cancellated structure, no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="09089a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, while a figure stands in a reverent attitude before it holding aloft a candle.</p>

<p>A second remarkable medal, which bean the name of Gaudentianus on the obverse and Urbicus on the reverse, depicts seemingly on one face the sacrifice of Abraham; on the other we see apparently a shrine or altar, above which three candles are burning, towards which a tall figure carrying a <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> in one hand is conducting a little child. The scene no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> represents the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of the child as an oblate (q.v.) by his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> before the shrine of some <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>, a custom for which there is a good deal of early evidence. Other medals are much more simple, bearing only the chrisma with a name or perhaps a cross. Others impressed with more complicated devices can only be dated with difficulty, and some are either spurious, or, as in the case particularly of some representations of the adoration of the <a href="09527a.htm">Magi</a> which seem to show strong traces of Byzantine influence, they belong to a much later epoch. Some of the medals or medallions reputedly <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> are stamped upon one side only, and of this class is a famous bronze medallion of very artistic execution discovered by Boldeti in the cemetery of <a href="06098b.htm">Domitilla</a> and now preserved in the Vatican Library. It bears two portrait types of the heads of the Apostles SS. Peter and Paul, and is assigned by de Rossi to the second century. Other medallions with the (confronted) heads of the two apostles are also known and a lively controversy largely based on these medallic materials has been carried on regarding the probability of their having preserved the tradition of an authentic likeness (See particularly Weis-Liebersdorf, "Christus und Apostelbilder", pp. 83 sq.) Certain supposed early medals with the head of our <a href="08374c.htm">Saviour</a> are distinctly open to suspicion. How far the use of such medal of devotion extended in the early Church it is not easy to decide. One or two passages in the works of <a href="15754d.htm">St. Zeno of Verona</a> have suggested that a medal of this kind was commonly given as a memorial of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but the point is <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. In the life of <a href="06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a>, which, despite the opinion of B. Krusch, is of early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, we read that <a href="06472b.htm">St. Germanus of Auxerre</a> hung around her neck a perforated bronze coin marked with the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, in memory of her having <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> her virginity to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (Mon. Ger. Hist.: Script. Merov., III, 217). The language seems to suggest that an ordinary coin was bored for the purpose, and when we recall how many of the <a href="11152a.htm">coins</a> of the late empire were stamped with the chrisma, or with the figure of the Saviour, it is easy to believe that the ordinary currency may often have been used for similar <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> purposes.</p>

<h2>During the Middle Ages</h2>

<p>Although it is probable that the traditions formed by the class of objects which we have been considering, and which were equally familiar at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and at Constantinople, never entirely died out, still little evidence exists of the use of medals in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. No traces of such objects survive remarkable either for artistic skill or for the value of the metal, and to speak positively of the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of certain objects of lead and pewter which may have been hung round the neck, with a religious intent, is not always easy. But in the course of the twelfth century, if not earlier, a very general practice grew tip at well-known places of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, of casting tokens in lead, and sometimes probably in other metals, which served the pilgrim as a souvenir and stimulus to devotion and at the same time attested the fact that he had duly reached his destination. These signacula (enseignes) known in English as "pilgrims' signs" often took a metallic form and were carried in a conspicuous way upon the hat or breast. <a href="06568d.htm">Giraldus Cambrensis</a> referring to a journey he made to Canterbury about the year 1180, ten years after the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Thomas, describes himself and his companions returning to <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> "cum signaculis Beati Thormae a collo suspensis" [with the tokens of St. Thomas hanging round their neck] (Opera, Rolls Series, I, p. 53). Again the author of Piers the Plowman writes of his imaginary pilgram:</p>

<blockquote><p>An hundred of <a href="01439c.htm">ampulles</a> on his hat seten, <br>Signes of syse and shelles of Galice; <br>And many a crouche on his cloke, and keyes of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <br>And the vernicle bifore, for men shulde knowe <br>And see by his signes whom he sought hadde.</p></blockquote>

<p>The "ampulles" probably represent Canterbury, but may have been tokens of the Holy Tear of Vendome (see Forgeais, "Collection", IV, 65 sq.); Syse stands for Assisi. The "shelles of Galice", i.e. the scallop-shells of St. James of Compostella; the crouche, or cross, of the Holy Land; the keys of St. Peter; the "vernicle", or figure of the Veronica, etc. are all very familiar types, represented in most collections of such objects. The privilege of casting and selling these pilgrim's signs was a very valuable one and became a regular source of income at most places of religious resort.</p>

<blockquote><p>Then, as manner and custom is, signes there they bought . . . <br>Each man set his silver in such thing as he liked,</p></blockquote>

<p>writes a fourteenth-century satirist of one of these shrines. Moreover we find that the custom was firmly established in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, and <a href="08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, by a letter of 18 Jan., 1200 (Pottbast, "Regesta", n. 939), grants to the canons of St. Peter's the monopoly of casting and selling those "signs of lead or pewter impressed with the image of the Apostles Peter and Paul with which those who visit their thresholds [<em>limina</em>] adorn themselves for the increase of their own devotion and in testimony of the journey which they have accomplished", and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> language implies that this custom had existed for some time. In form and fashion these <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims'</a> signs are very various and a considerable literature exists upon the subject (see especially the work of Forgeais, "Collection de Plombs histori&eacute;s", 5 vols., Paris, 1864). From about the twelfth century the casting of these devotional objects continued until the close of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and even later, but in the sixteenth or seventeenth century they began to be replaced by medals properly so called in bronze or in silver, often with much greater pretensions to artistic execution. With these leaden Signs should be noted the custom of casting coin-like tokens in connection with the <a href="06132a.htm">Feast of Fools</a>, the celebration of the <a href="02725a.htm">Boy Bishop</a> and the <a href="07419a.htm">Innocents</a>. The extant specimens belong mostly to the sixteenth century, but the practice must be much older. Though there is often a burlesque element introduced, the legends and devices shown by such pieces are nearly all religious; e.g., Ex Ore Infancium Perfecisti Laudem; Innocens Vous Aidera, etc. (see Vanhende, "Plomm&eacute;s des Innocents," Lille, 1877).</p>

<p>Better deserving of attention are the vast collection of <em>jetons</em> and <em>m&eacute;reaux</em> which, beginning in the thirteenth century, continued to be produced all through the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and lasted on in some places down to the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. The jetons were strictly speaking counters, i.e., they were thin pieces of metal, mostly latten, a sort of brass, stamped an both sides with some device and originally used in conjunction with a <em>comptoir</em> (i.e., an abacus or counting board) to perform arithmetical computations. The name comes from <em>jeter</em>, through the form <em>jectoir</em>, because they were "thrown down" upon this board (see Rondot, "M&eacute;dailleurs Francais", Paris, 1904, p. 48). It soon became the fashion for every personage of distinction, especially those who had anything to do with finance, to have special jetons bearing his own device, and upon some of these considerable artistic skill was lavished. These pieces served various purposes besides that for which they were originally designed, and they were often used in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> where we should now use a ticket or printed card. As might be expected, they tended to take a religious tone. Upon nearly half the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> jetons which survive <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> mottoes are found and often <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> devices (Rouyer, "Histoke du Jeton", p. 30). Among the commonest of these mottoes, which however vary <a href="08004a.htm">infinitely</a>, we might name AVE MARIA GRATIA PLENA; AMES DIEU ET LO (i.e. aimez dieu et louez le); <a href="07649a.htm">IHS</a> Son Gre Soit Fait Ci; Virgo Mater Ecclesie Eterne Porta, Domine Dominus Noster, etc. Often these jetons were given as presents or "pieces de plaisir "especially to <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of high consideration, and on such occasions they were often specially struck in gold or silver. One particular and very common use of jetons was to serve as vouchers for attendance at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> offices and meetings of various kinds. In this case they often carried with them a title to certain rations or payments of money, the amount being sometimes stamped on the piece. The tokens thus used were known as <em>jetons de pr&eacute;sence</em> or <em>m&eacute;reaur</em>, and they were largely used, especially at a somewhat later date, to secure the due attendance of the canons at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> offices, etc. What, however, specially justifies their mention in the present place is the fact that in many cases the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> device they bore was as much or even more considered than the use to which they were put, and they seem to have discharged a function analogous to the Child-of-Mary medals, the <a href="13508b.htm">scapulars</a>, the badges and even the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> pictures of our own day. One famous example is the "m&eacute;reau d'estaing" bearing stamped upon it the <a href="07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>, which the famous Fr&egrave;re Richard, whose name is closely if not too creditably associated with the history of <a href="08409c.htm">Blessed Joan of Arc</a>, distributed to his followers in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1429 (see Rouyer, "Le Nom de J&eacute;sus" in "Revue Belge de Numis.", 1896-7). These jetons stamped with the Name, were very numerous and were probably closely connected with the apostolate of <a href="02505b.htm">St. Bernardine of Siena</a>. Finally it is to be noted that for the purpose of largess at royal <a href="04380a.htm">coronations</a> or for the Maundy, pieces were often struck which perhaps are rather to be regarded as medals than actual money (see Mazerolle, "Les M&eacute;dailleurs Fran&ccedil;ais, 1902-1904, vol. I, page lii).</p>

<h2>In modern times</h2>

<p>Although roughly speaking it is correct to say that medals were unknown in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, still their introduction belongs to the early <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> period, and it is only when we consider them as a form of popular devotion, that we can describe them as of post-Reformation origin. Medals properly so called, i.e. pieces of metal struck or cast with a commemorative purpose, began, though there are only a few rare specimens, in the last years of the fourteenth century (Rondot, loc. cit., 60-62). The first certainly known medal was struck for Francesco Carrara (Novello) on the occasion of the capture of Padua in 1390, but practically the vogue of this form of art was created by Vittore Pisano, called Pisanello (c. 1380-1451), and its first developments were all Italian. These early <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> medals, magnificent as they are, belong to civil life and only touch upon our immediate subject, but though not religious in intent many of them possess a strong religious colouring. Nothing more devotional could be imagined than the beautiful reverse of Pisano's medal of Malatesta Novello, where the mail-clad warrior dismounting from his horse is represented as kneeling before the crucifix. So again the large medal, in the Brittish Museum, of <a href="13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> holding the crucifix, probably executed by <a href="13095a.htm">Andrea della Robbia</a>, portrays with rare fidelity "his deep-set glowing eye, his bony cheeks, the strong nose and protruding lips" (Fabriczy, "Italian Medals", p. 133), while the reverse displays the avenging sword of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the Holy Ghost hovering over the doomed city of Florence. Wonderful again in their religious feeling are Antonio Marescotti's (c. 1453) superb medals of San Bernardino da Siena, while among the series of early <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> medals we have such masterpieces as the portrait of <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> by Andrea Guazzalotti (1435-95).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But it was long before this new art made its influence so far widely felt as to bring metal representations of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and shrines, of mysteries and <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>, together with emblems and devices of all kinds, in a cheap form into the hands of the people. Undoubtedly the gradual substitution of more artistic bronze and silver medals for the rude pilgrim's signs at such great sanctuaries as Loreto or St. Peter's, did much to help on the general acceptance of medals as objects of devotion. Again the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> jubilee medals which certainly began as early as 1475, and which from the nature of the case were carried into all parts of the world, must have helped to make the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> familiar. But this was not all. At some time during the sixteenth century the practice was adopted, possibly following an usage long previously in vogue in the case of Agnus Deis (q.v.) of giving a <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> blessing to medals and even of enriching them with <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. On the other hand it is noteworthy that among the benediction forms of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> no single example is found of a blessing for <em>numismata</em>. A pilgrim's "insignia" were often blessed no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>, but by this term were only meant his scrip and staff (see Franz, "Kirchlichen Benedictionen im Mittelalter", II, 271-89), not the leaden tokens spoken of above. The story runs that the use of blessed medals began with the revolt of the Gueux in <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, A.D 1566. A certain medal or rather set of medals bearing on the obverse, the head of Philip II with the motto EN TOUT FIDELES AU ROI and on the reverse a beggar's wallet and the words JUSQUE A PORTER LA BESACE, Wag used by the Gueux faction as a badge. To this the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> replied by striking a medal with the head of our Saviour and on the reverse the image of our Lady of Hal, and <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> granted an <a href="07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to those who wore this medal in their hats (Simonis, "Art du Medailleur en Belgique", 1904, II, pp. 76-80).</p>

<p>From this the custom of blessing and <a href="07783a.htm">indulgencing</a> medals is said to have rapidly extended under the sanction of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. Certain it is that <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> attached <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to some ancient <a href="11152a.htm">coins</a> discovered in the foundations of the buildings at the <a href="13505a.htm">Scala Santa</a>, which <a href="11152a.htm">coins</a> he caused to be richly mounted and sent to <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of distinction. Thus encouraged, and stimulated further by the vogue of the jubilee and other <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> medals of which we have still to speak, the use of these devotional objects spread to every part of the world. <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and Boherma seem to have taken the lead in introducing the fashion into central <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and some exceptionally fine specimens were produced under the inspiration of the Italian artists whom the Emperor Maximilian invited to his court. Some of the religious medals cast by Antonio Abondio and his pupils at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> are of the highest order of excellence. But in the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries almost every considerable city in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> came to have craftsmen of its own who followed the industry, and the tradition created by such Italian artists as Lesne Leoni at <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, with men, like Jonghelinck and Stephen of <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> for his pupils, and by John de Candida, Nicholas Of Florence and Benvenuto Cellini in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, was bound to have lasting effects.</p>

<p>The number and variety of the religious pieces produced at a later date, as Domanig (Die deutsch Privat-Medaille, p. 29) is fain to attest, defies all classification. Only one writer the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> L. Kuncze (in his, "Systematik der Weihmuzen" Raab, 1885), seems to have seriously grappled with the task and his success is very moderate. As an indication of the vast complexity of the subject, we may note that in the thirty-first of his fifty divisions, the section devoted to medals commemorative of churches and sanctuaries of the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, he enumerates over 700 such shrines of which he has found some record &#151; the number is probably immensely greater &#151; while in connection with the majority of these, special medals have at some time been struck, often, e.g. at Loreto, in an almost endless series. Under these circumstances, all that can be done is to point out a few illustrative groups rather apart from the common rum of <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> medals; those connected with places, confraternities <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, mysteries, <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>, devotions, &amp;c., are types with which everyone is familiar.</p>

<h3 id="A">Plague medals</h3>

<p>Struck and blessed as a protection against pestilence. The subjects are very various e.g., the figure of St. Sebastian and <a href="13100c.htm">St. Roch</a>, and different shrines of the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, often also with a view of some particular city. Round them are commonly inscribed mysterious letters analogous to those depicted on the famous <a href="13338a.htm">medal of St. Benedict</a>. For example <em>+. z +. D. I. A.</em> etc. These letters stand for "Crux Christi salva, nos"; "Zelus domus Dei libera me", "Crux Christi vincit et regnat per lignum crucis libera me Domine ab, hac peste Deus meus expelle pestem et libera me, etc. (See Beierlein "Munzer bayerischer Kloster", and the monographs devoted to this subject by Pfeiffer and Ruland, "Pestilentia, in Nummis", T&uuml;bingen, 1882, and "Die deutschen Pestainulette", Leipzig, 1885.)</p>

<h3 id="B">Medals commemorating miracles of the Eucharist</h3>

<p>There were a very large number of these struck for jubilees, centenaries, etc., in the different places where these <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> were believed to have happened, often adorned with very quaint devices. There is one for example, commemorative of the <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a> at Seefeld, upon which the story is depicted of a nobleman who demanded to receive a large host at communion like the <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a>. The <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> complies, but as a punishment for the nobleman's presumption the ground opens and swallows him up (see Pachinger, "Wallfahrts Medafflen der Tirol", Vienna, 1908).</p>

<h3 id="C">Private medals</h3>

<p>These form a very large class, but particular specimens are often extremely scarce, for they were struck to commemorate life of <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and were only distributed to friends. Baptisms, <a href="09707a.htm">marriages</a>, first communions, deaths formed the principal occasions for striking these private medals. The <a href="02258b.htm">baptismal</a> or a sponsor medals (<em>pathen medaillen</em>) are particularly interesting, and often contain precise details as to the hour of birth which would the child's horoscope to be calculated. (See Domanig, "Die deutsche Privat-Medaille", <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1893, 3, pp 25-26.)</p>

<h3 id="D">Medals commemorative of special legends</h3>

<p>Of this class the famous Cross of St. Ulrich of <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> may serve as a specimen. A cross is supposed to have been brought by an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> to St. Ulrich that he might bear it in his hands in the great battle against the Huns, A.D. 955. Freisenegger in his monograph "Die Ulrichs-kreuze" (Augsburg, 1895), enumerates 180 types of this object of devotion sometimes in cross sometimes in medal form, often associated with the <a href="13338a.htm">medal of St. Benedict</a>.</p>

<p>Papal medals do not immediately belong to this place, for they are not precisely devotional in purpose, but a very large number of these pieces are ultimately associated with <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions of various kinds, and more particularly with the opening and closing of the Holy Door in the years of Jubilee. The series with the pontificate of <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, in 1417, and continues down to the present day. Some types professing to commemorate the acts of earlier <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, e.g. the Jubilee of <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, are reconstructions (i.e. fabrications) of later date. Nearly all the most noteworthy actions of each pontificate for the last five hundred years have been commemorated by medals in this manner, and some of the most famous artists such as Benvenuto Cellini, Carsdosso, and others have been employed in designing them, The wonderful <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the Hamerani, who from 1605 down to about 1807 acted as <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> medallists and supplied the greater proportion of that vast series, deserve to be specially mentioned for the uniform excellence of their work.</p>

<p>Other semi-devotional medals are those which have been struck by important religious association, as for example by the Knights of Malta, by certain <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in commemoration of their <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, or in connection with particular orders of knighthood. On some of these series of medals useful monographs have been written, as for example the work of Canon H. C. Schembri, on "The Coins and Medals of the Knights of Malta", (London, 1908). It has been said above that Agnus Deis seem to have been blessed by the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> With more or less solemnity from an early period, and similar forms of benediction were used in connexion with the <a href="06629a.htm">Golden Rose</a>, the Sword and Cap, and other objects given by the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> as presents. In the sixteenth century this practice was greatly developed. The custom grew up not only of bringing objects which had touched certain relies or shrines to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to be <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a>, but also of the pontiff blessing, <a href="13184b.htm">rosaries</a>, "grains" medals, enriching them with <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and sending them, through his privileged missionaries or envoys, to be distributed to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. On these occasions a paper of instructions was often drawn up defining exactly the nature of these <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and the conditions on which they could be gained. Several papers of this kind &#151; one in favour of <a href="09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a> (1576) and others for <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> north of the Alps &#151; have been preserved, emanating from <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. One is printed by Knox in the "Douay Diaries", P. 367: The <a href="07788a.htm">Apostolic Indulgences</a> attached to medals, <a href="13184b.htm">rosaries</a> and similar objects by all <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> duly authorized, are analogous to these. They are imparted by making a simple <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, but for certain other objects, e.g. the <a href="13338a.htm">medal of St. Benedict</a>, more special faculties are required, and an elaborate form of benediction is provided. Quite recently [1911] <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> has sanctioned the use of a blessed medal to be worn in place of the brown and other <a href="13508b.htm">scapulars</a>. The concession was originally made for the benefit of the native <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the missions of the Congo, but the Holy Father has expressed his readiness to grant to other <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who apply, the faculty of blessing medals which may be worn in place of the <a href="13508b.htm">scapular</a> (see "Le Canoniste Contemporain", Feb., 1910, p. 115).</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">Almost the only attempt at a systematic classification of devotional medals In general seems to have been made by KUNCZE Systematik der Weihnsfingen (Raab, 1885), but the work is neither scholarly nor scientific.
