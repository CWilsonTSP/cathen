<p><a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, scholar, and statesman, b. at <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, 27 Dec., 1756; d. at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 19 Feb., 1844; son of Orazio Pacca, Marchese di Matrice, and Crispina Malaspina. He was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, by the Somaschans in the Clementine College at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and at the Accademia de' Nobili Ecclesiastici. In 1785 <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> appointed him <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, the centre of anti-Roman agitation. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Damiata and arrived at Cologne in June, 1786. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Archduke Maximilian of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who had written a courteous letter to Pacca at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, told him he would not be recognized unless he formally promised not to exercise any act of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the archdiocese. The same attitude was taken by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> and <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. Hostility to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, incited chiefly by the work of <a href="07463a.htm">Febronius</a> (see <a href="06023a.htm">FEBRONIANISM</a>) was then at a high pitch on account of the establishment of the new nunciature of <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a>. The other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, however, and the magistrates of Cologne received Pacca with all due respect. Even <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> made no difficulty, and its monarch, in recognition of his friendly attitude, was accorded at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the title of king, against which <a href="04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (1701) had protested when the emperor would have granted it. On his journey through his dominions on the Rhine Frederick William received the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> with great <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Pacca's position with respect to the three <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> electors was difficult. When the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, in 1786, opened the <a href="02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a>, that of Cologne being still loyal to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the discourses given were a declaration of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. At Cologne, too, an attempt was made to support <a href="06023a.htm">Febronian</a> propositions, but was frustrated by the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, against whom innumerable pamphlets were directed. But Pacca induced some prominent German writers to uphold the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He soon had a dispute with the Elector of Cologne. Conformably to the Punctuation of Ems, agreed on by the three archbishop-electors and the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> in 1786, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a> protested against a matrimonial <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> given by the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in virtue of his faculties, and went so far as to grant <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> not contained in his quinquennial faculties, instructing the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> to have no further recourse to the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> for similar <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a>. The <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, in accordance with instructions from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, directed a circular to all the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> in his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> apprising them of the invalidity of such <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a>. The four <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> thereupon appealed to <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> to entirely abolish the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncios</a>, and the emperor referred the matter to the Diet of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, where it was quashed. Pacca also opposed freedom of worship for the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of Cologne, but so tactfully that his intervention was not apparent, and did not offend the King of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. In 1790 he went on a secret mission to the Diet of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> to safeguard the interests of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and prevented the adoption of a new concordat.</p>

<p>When the French invaded the Rhine Provinces, he was ordered to leave Cologne, but he had the satisfaction of being finally recognized as <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> by the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>. In 1794 he was appointed <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, but accomplished nothing of importance there. Of both nunciatures, he wrote memoirs, containing observations on the character of the countries and their governments. While still at <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, he was created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of the title of S. Silvestro in Capite (23 February, 1801), and assigned to various congregations. In 1808 French troops were stationed in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Yielding to the insistence of <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> sacrificed <a href="04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a>, his faithful secretary of State, and the pro-secretaries, Casoni, Doria, and Gabrielli. The last-named was surprised in his apartments by the soldiers, placed under arrest, and ordered to leave <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> territory. Two days later (18 June, 1808) the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Pacca pro-secretary.</p>

<p>In his new position Pacca carefully avoided everything that might provoke the emperor's <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a>, even ignoring the excesses of the French soldiery in and about <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But in August he felt <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to publish in every province a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> forbidding subjects of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to enlist in the new "Civic Guard" (<em>see</em> <a href="10687a.htm">NAPOLEON I</a>) and, in general, under any foreign command. The "Civic Guard" was a hotbed of turbulence that might easily produce a rebellion in the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>. But Miollis, the French commandant, was furious, and threatened Pacca with dismissal from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The pro-secretary replied that he took orders from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> alone. Realizing that the annexation of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was inevitable, Pacca took precautions to prevent a sudden attack on the Quirinal; at the same time advising calm and quiet. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had been prepared in 1806, to be published in the event of annexation. On 10 June, 1809, when the change of government actually took place, the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> was <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a>; on 6 July, the Quirinal was attacked, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> arrested and taken to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and thence to Savona. Pacca was among those who accompanied him. As far as Florence, he tried to cheer <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>; at Florence he was torn from the pontiff's side, much to his sorrow, and saw him again only at Rivoli and <a href="07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>. From Grenoble he was conducted (6 Aug., 1809) to Fenestrelle, where he was confined with great severity, and could hardly find opportunities for confession and communion. Later, however, this restriction was removed. During this period the captive minister found time to write those records which formed the substance of his "Memorie storiche del ministero" etc.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Finally, on 30 January, 1813, he was told that in view of the concordat between the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> at Fontainebleau (25 January) he was free to join the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had long objected to his liberation, declaring: "Pacca is my enemy". At Fontainebleau he and the other liberated <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> insisted that <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> should retract the last concordat and refuse further negotiations until he was back in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with full freedom. Pacca also suggested the re-establishment of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, although both the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and he himself had been <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in prejudices against the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. When <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was conducted to Savona the second time, Pacca was deported to Uzes (January, 1814), leaving that place on 22 April. He joined the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="14013a.htm">Sinigaglia</a> whence he accompanied him to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Appointed <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="03217a.htm">camerlengo</a> in the same year, he exerted himself to re-establish the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders from the foundations not already sold.</p>

<p>During the absence of <a href="04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> at the Congress of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, Pacca again became pro-secretary of State, the restoration of the pontifical Government thus devolving upon him. He was reproved by <a href="04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, from <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, for his severity towards the supporters of the <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> regime, and vainly tried to justify his conduct. When Murat, King of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, sent his troops through the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> to meet the Austrians, Pacca advised <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to seek temporary refuge at <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, fearing that Murat would attempt to ravage the domains of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. During the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> absence, the provisional Government caused the arrest of Cardinal Maury on a charge of having secret intelligence with Murat, and his trial was continued even after the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> return. But <a href="04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, immediately on his arrival, stopped the proceedings. The rest of Pacca's life was occupied in the affairs of the different congregations to which he was assigned, and in the administration of the <a href="14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>. <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> appointed him pro-datary, he was the first to hold the post of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Velletri</a>, and he was active against the <a href="03330c.htm">Carbonari</a>.</p>

<p>Cardinal Pacca's house was frequented by the most illustrious scientists, men of letters, and artists, both Roman and foreign. He had excavations made at <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a> at his own expense, and with the objects discovered formed a small museum in his vineyard on the Via Aurelia (Casino of <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a>).</p>

<p>Acute observations on politics and the philosophy of history are found in his "Memorie storiche della nunziatura di Colonia"; "Dei grandi meriti verso la Chiesa Cattolica del clero dell' Universita e de' Magistrati di Colonia nel secolo XVI"; "Notizie sul Portogallo e sulla nunziatura di Lisbona"; "Memorie storiche per servire alla storia ecclesiastica del secolo XIX" (1809-14); "Notizie storiche intorno alla vita e gli scritti di Mons. Franc. Pacca, arcivescovo di Benevento (1752-75)".</p>
