<p>[<em>Editor's Note:</em> St. Oliver Plunkett was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Paul VI on October 10, 1975.]</p>

<p><a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="01729a.htm">Armagh</a> and <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of all <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, born at Loughcrew near Oldcastle, County Meath, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1629; died 11 July, 1681. His is the brightest name in the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church throughout the whole period of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. He was connected by birth with the <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> which had just then been ennobled, the Earls of Roscommon and Fingall, as well as with Lords Louth and Dunsany. Till his sixteenth year, his <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> was attended to by Patrick Plunket, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Mary's, <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, brother of the first Earl of Fingall, afterwards <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, successively, of <a href="01699c.htm">Ardagh</a> and <a href="10097a.htm">Meath</a>. He witnessed the first triumphs of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Confederates, and, as an aspirant to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, set out for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1645, under the care of Father Scarampo, of the Roman Oratory. As a student of the <a href="08157a.htm">Irish College</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which some twenty years before had been founded by Cardinal Ludovisi, his record was particularly brilliant. The Rector, in after years, attested that he "devoted himself with such ardour to philosophy, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and mathematics, that in the Roman College of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> he was justly ranked amongst the foremost in talent, diligence, and progress in his studies, and he pursued with abundant fruit the course of civil and canon law at the Roman Sapienza, and everywhere, at all times, was a model of gentleness, integrity, and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>". Promoted to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1654, Dr. Plunket was deputed by the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to act as their representative in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Throughout the period of the Cromwellian usurpation and the first years of Charles II's reign he most effectually pleaded the cause of the suffering Church, whilst at the same time he discharged the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> professor at the College of <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. In the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>, 9 July, 1669, he was appointed to the <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> see of Armagh, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 30 Nov., at <a href="06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, assisted by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06045a.htm">Ferns</a> and another <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> was granted him in <a href="04285a.htm">Consistory</a> 28 July, 1670.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Dr. Plunket lingered for some time in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, using his influence to mitigate the rigour of the administration of the anti-Catholic <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and it was only in the middle of March, 1670, that he entered on his apostolate in <a href="01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. From the very outset he was most <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the exercise of the sacred ministry. Within three months he had administered the Sacrament of Confirmation to about 10,000 of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, some of them being sixty years old, and, writing to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in December, 1673, he was able to announce that "during the past four years", he had confirmed no fewer that 48,655 people. To bring this sacrament within the reach of the suffering faithful he had to undergo the severest hardships, often with no other food than a little oaten bread; he had to seek out their abodes on the mountains and in the woods, and as a rule, it was under the broad canopy of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> that the Sacrament was administered, both flock and <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> being exposed to the wind and rain. He made extraordinary efforts to bring the <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a> of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> within the reach of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> youth. In effecting this during the short interval of peace that marked the beginning of his episcopate his efforts were most successful. He often refers in his letters to the high school which he opened at Drogheda, at this time the second city in the kingdom. He invited <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to take charge of it, and very soon it had one hundred and fifty boys on the roll, of whom no fewer than forty were sons of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> gentry. He held frequent ordinations, celebrated two Provincial Synods, and was untiring in rooting out abuses and promoting <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p>

<p>One incident of his episcopate merits special mention: there was a considerable number of so-called Tories scattered through the province of Ulster, most of whom had been despoiled of their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> under the <a href="01112a.htm">Act of Settlement</a>. They banded themselves together in the shelter of the mountain fastnesses and, as outlaws, lived by the plunder of those around them. Anyone who sheltered them incurred the <a href="12565a.htm">penalty of death</a> from the Government, anyone who refused them such shelter met with death at their hands. Dr. Plunket, with the sanction of the Lord Lieutenant, went in search of them, not without great risk, and reasoning with them in a kind and paternal manner induced them to renounce their career of plundering. He moreover obtained pardons for them so that they were able to transfer themselves to other countries, and thus peace was restored throughout the whole province. The contemporary <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, Dr. Brennan, who was the constant companion of Dr. Plunket, in a few words sketches the fruitful <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a>: "During the twelve years of his residence here he proved himself vigilant, <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a>, and indefatigable, nor do we find, within the memory of those of the present century, that any <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> or <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> visited his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> and province with such solicitude and pastoral <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> as he did, - benefitting, as far as was in his power, the needy; wherefore he was applauded and <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> by both <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people".</p>

<p>The storm of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> burst with renewed fury on the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church in 1673; the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were scattered, the <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> were closed. Dr. Plunket, however, would not forsake his flock. His palace thenceforward was some thatched hut in a remote part of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. As a rule, in company with the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, he lay concealed in the woods or on the mountains, and with such scanty shelter that through the roof they could at night count the stars of the sky. He tells their hardship in one of his letters: "The snow fell heavily, mixed with hailstones, which were very large and hard. A cutting north wind blew in our faces, and snow and hail beat so dreadfully in our eyes that up to the present we have scarcely been able to see with them. Often we were in danger in the valleys of being lost and suffocated in the snow, till at length we arrived at the house of a reduced gentleman who had nothing to lose. But, for our misfortune, he had a stranger in his house by whom we did not wish to be recognized, hence we were placed in a garret without chimney, and without fire, where we have been for the past eight days. May it redound to the glory of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, and of the flock entrusted to our charge".</p>

<p>Writs for the arrest of Dr. Plunket were repeatedly issued by the Government. At length he was seized and cast into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a> in Dublin Castle, 6 Dec., 1679, and a whole host of <a href="11696a.htm">perjured</a> informers were at hand to swear his life away. In <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the character of those witnesses was well known and no jury would listen to their <a href="11696a.htm">perjured</a> tales, but in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> it was not so, and accordingly his trial was transferred to London. In fact, the Shaftesbury Conspiracy against the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> could not be sustained without the supposition that a rebellion was being organized in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> would, of course, be at the head of such a rebellion. His visits to the Tories of Ulster were now set forth as part and parcel of such a rebellion. A French or Spanish fleet was chartered by him to land an army at Carlingford Bay, and other such accusations were laid to his charge. But there was no secret as to the fact that his being a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was his real crime. Lord Brougham in "Lives of the Chief Justices of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>" brands Chief Justice Pemberton, who presided at the trial of Dr. Plunket, as betraying the cause of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and bringing disgrace on the English Bar. This Chief Justice set forth from the bench that there could be no greater crime than to endeavour to propagate the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, "than which (he declared) there is not anything more displeasing to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> or more pernicious to <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> in the world". Sentence of death was pronounced as a matter of course, to which the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> replied in a <a href="07131b.htm">joyous</a> and emphatic voice: <a href="04737a.htm">"Deo Gratias"</a>.</p>

<p>On Friday, 11 July (old style the 1st), 1681, Dr. Plunket, surrounded by a numerous guard of military, was led to Tyburn for execution. Vast crowds assembled along the route and at Tyburn. As Dr. Brennan, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, in an official letter to <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, attests, all were edified and filled with admiration, "because he displayed such a serenity of countenance, such a tranquillity of mind and elevation of <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, that he seemed rather a spouse hastening to the nuptial feast, than a culprit led forth to the scaffold". From the scaffold he delivered a discourse worthy of an apostle and <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>. An eye-witness of the execution declared that by his discourse and by his heroism in death he gave more glory to religion than he could have won for it by many years of a fruitful apostolate. His remains were gathered with loving care and <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> apart in <a href="06559a.htm">St. Giles'</a> churchyard. In the first months of 1684 they were transferred to the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Lambspring in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, whence after 200 years they were with due veneration translated and enshrined in St. Gregory's College, Downside, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The head, in excellent preservation, was from the first enshrined apart, and since 1722 has been in the care of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Nuns at their <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> Convent at Drogheda, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. Pilgrims come from all parts of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and from distant countries to venerate this <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the glorious <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and many <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> are recorded.</p>

<p>The name of Archbishop Plunket appears on the list of the 264 heroic servants of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> who shed their blood for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which was officially submitted for approval to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and for which the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> was signed by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> 9 Dec., 1886, authorizing their Cause of Beatification to be submitted to the Congregation of Rites. The Blessed Oliver Plunket's <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> closed the long series of deaths for the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, at Tyburn. The very next day after his execution, the bubble of conspiracy burst. Lord Shaftesbury, the chief instigator of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, was consigned to the Tower, and his chief <a href="11696a.htm">perjured</a> witness Titus Oates was thrown into gaol. For a few years the <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a> of comparative peace were restored to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.</p>
