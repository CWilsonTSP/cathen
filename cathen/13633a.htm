<p>(Scrantonensis).</p>

<p>A suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> of Philadelphia, <a href="15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> established on 3 March, 1868, comprises the Counties of Lackawanna, Luzerne, Bradford, Susquehanna, Wayne, Tioga, Sullivan, <a href="15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>, Lycoming, Pike, and Monree, all in the north-east part of <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>; area, 8,487 sq. miles.</p>

<p>Scranton, the <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, is in the heart of the anthracite region and is a progressive city of 130,000 inhabitants (1910). Other large cities are Wilkes-Barre, Williamsport, Hazelton, Carbondale, and Pittston.</p>

<p>The pioneer <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers were principally of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> and German descent, but in recent years the coal-mining industry has attracted numerous <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> labourers, mostly of the <a href="14042a.htm">Slav</a> and Italian races, until these now number almost one-half of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>Although many of the pioneer settlers were <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants, yet the first official visit of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> to this territory of which there is any authentic record was in 1787. In that year Rev. James Pellentz travelled up the Susquehanna River as far as Elmira, ministering to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> scattered through this region. He returned to <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, whence he had come, and reported conditions to his superiors. A few years after the visit of Father Pellentz the famous French settlement of Asylum or "Azilum" was founded (1793-94). The site chosen was on the banks of the Susquehanna River, opposite the present village of Standing-Stone, Bradford County. It seems to have been planned as a retreat for the nobility, who were forced to flee from the terrors of the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, and it was evidently intended that the queen herself should take refuge there. The most conspicuous building in the village, the "Queen's house" or "La grande maison", as it was generally called, was built and furnished for her special accommodation. These plans, however, miscarried, for before the house was completed the unfortunate queen had followed her husband to the guillotine. For ten years this unique settlement flourished. It was made up, as we are told, of "some of the nobility and gentlemen of the court of Louis XVI, several of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, a few mechanics and a number of the labouring class". The village consisted of about fifty houses. At the close of the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> most of the prominent refugees at Asylum accepted the invitation of <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and returned to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1804 we find the settlement practically abandoned.</p>

<p>This settlement was evidently made up almost entirely of <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and among them a few <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. From a contemporary writer we learn that among the inhabitants of Asylum in 1795 was a certain "M. Carles, a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and canon of Guernsey" and also a "M. Becdellierre, formerly a canon". Religious services in the settlement were conducted by Ezra Fromentin, "acting <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in the little log <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>" and M. Carles. We read also of a certain Abb&eacute; Colin, who, after the abandonment of the settlement, went to the West Indies as <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in the army. Mention is also made of a beautiful illuminated <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a> used there in the religious services, and afterwards presented to the Vatican Museum. Today scarcely a trace of this unique and interesting settlement remains. The earliest permanent <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlements were at Friendsville, and Silver Lake, Susquehanna County. These, as well as the other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers scattered throughout this district, were attended occasionally by <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> sent from Philadelphia. In 1825, largely through the solicitations of Mr. Patrick Griffin, father of <a href="07032a.htm">Gerald Griffin</a>, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> novelist, dramatist, and poet, then a resident of Susquehanna County, <a href="08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a>, of Philadelphia, sent Rev. John O'Flynn as the first resident <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>. His work, however, was rather that of a missionary, as his field of labour comprised thirteen counties in morth-eastern <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and five counties in New York State. The first church was built in 1825 near Silver Lake. Father O'Flynn died at Danville in 1829, and was succeeded by Father Clancy. On 1 Feb., 1836, Rev. Henry Fitzsimmons was sent to take charge of this territory, and took up his residence at Carbondale, where a church had been built in 1832, Silver Lake being attended from Carbondale as a mission. In 1838 Rev. John Vincent O'Reilly was sent by <a href="08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> to assist in administering to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of this extensive territory. He took up his residence at St. Joseph's, <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>,  and his charge comprised the Counties of Susquehanna, Bradford, Tioga, Potter, and Sullivan in <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and the five adjoining counties in New York State. The early history of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is intimately bound up with the truly heroic labours of Father O'Reilly, and foundations of many of the present <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> were the results of his missionary <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. His fruitful career was brought to an untimely end at the railway station at Susquehanna, 4 Oct., 1873. He was killed while rescuing a friend from the path of an approaching train.</p>

<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>Rt. Rev. William O'Hara, D.D., the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born at Dungiven, County Derry, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 14 Apr., 1816, where his early <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> was received. His <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies were made at the urban College of the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 21 Dec., 1842. His first appointment was as assistant at St. Patrick's Church, Philadelphia. He was afterwards made <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> and professor of <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a> at St. Charles's Seminary. In 1856 he was appointed <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Patrick's Church, Philadelphia. He was afterwards made <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> and professor of <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a> at St. Charles's Seminary. In 1856 he was appointed <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Patrick's Church, Philadelphia, where he remained until his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Scranton, 12 July, 1868. The diocese then numbered 50 churches and 25 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. He died on 3 Feb., 1899, and is buried under the main altar of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Scranton.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Rt. Rev. Michael John Hoban, D.D., the second <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born at Waterloo, <a href="10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, 6 June, 1853. His early <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> was received at Hawley, <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, whither his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> moved shortly after his birth. He afterwards attended <a href="06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> College (New York), Holy Cross College (Worchester, <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>), and St. John's College (<a href="15203b.htm">Fordham</a>). After one year at St. Charles's Seminary, Overbrook, he entered the American College, <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1875, where he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, 22 May, 1880. His first appointment was as assistant at Towanda. He afterwards laboured successively as assistant at Pittston and <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Troy. In 1887 he organized St. Leo's <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, Ashley, <a href="11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, where the present beautiful church and rectory are monuments of his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. There he remained until his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01245a.htm">Alalis</a> and coadjutor <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Scranton, 22 Mar., 1896. During his administration, since the death of Bishop O'Hara, he has enacted important legislation with regard to the internal affairs of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and under his inspiration the present beautiful and well-equipped St. Joseph's Infant Asylum, as also the Maloney Home for the Aged, have been added to the equipment of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the latter being the gift of the Marquess Martin J. Maloney of Philadelphia, in memory of his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>. Since the death of his predecessor, the diocese has grown from 152 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 121 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, and a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 135,000, to 265 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 232 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, and a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 265,000 (1911).</p>

<h2>Catholic education</h2>

<p><a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in the diocese began with, and received a great impetus from the great pioneer Father O'Reilly. In the autumn of 1842 he opened a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at St. Joseph's, Susquehanna County. From a very modest beginning, and under his immediate supervision, it grew and flourished; and in the twenty-two years of its existence <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and over a score of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. It was destroyed by fire, 1 Jan, 1864, and was never rebuilt. At the present time higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is cared for by St. Thomas's College, in charge of the <a href="08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>; The Latin and Greek courses being taught by two of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Mount St. Mary's Seminary, Scranton, conducted by the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and St. Ann's Academy, Wilkes-Barre, conducted by the <a href="03711a.htm">Sisters of Christian Charity</a>, are both flourishing and rapidly growing boarding-schools for girls. St. Mary's <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> high school, Wilkes-Berre, conducted by the <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, deserves mention as a model of equipment and efficiency. Nearly all of the larger <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> have their own <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted by the sisters of the different teaching communities. Facilities for the preservation of the languages of the various nationalities are afforded in their <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, which, for the most part, are conducted by sisters familiar with the mother-tongue. To meet this need two new teaching orders have recently been established; Sisters of Sts. Cyril and Methodius (Slovak) and Sisters of St. Casimir (Lithuanian). Both these orders had their inception in the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="10605a.htm">Mount St. Mary's</a>, Scranton, where the first candidates were trained. The diocese now numbers 49 <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and 14,440 pupils (1911).</p>
