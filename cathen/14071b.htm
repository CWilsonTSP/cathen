<p>A designation of which the exact meaning has varied at different times.</p>

<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p>"By a secret <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was formerly meant a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> which was known to exist, but whose members and places of meetings were not publicly known. Today, we understand by a secret <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> with secrets, having a ritual demanding an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance and secrecy, prescribing ceremonies of a <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="03584b.htm">character</a>, such as the use of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, either by extracts therefrom, or by its being placed an altar within a lodge-room, by the use of <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, of <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, of religious signs and symbols, special funeral services, etc." (Rosen, "The Catholic Church and Secret Societies," p. 2). <a href="12634a.htm">Raich</a> gives a more elaborate description: "Secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> are those organizations which completely conceal their rules, corporate activity, the names of their members, their signs, passwords and usages from outsiders or the 'profane.' As a rule, the members of these <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> are bound to the strictest secrecy concerning all the business of the association by <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> or promise or word of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, and often under the threat of severe punishment in case of its violation. If such secret <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> has higher and lower degrees, the members of the higher degree must be equally careful to conceal their secrets from their brethren of a lower degree. In certain secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, the members are not allowed to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> even the names of their highest officers. Secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> were founded to promote certain ideal aims, to be obtained not by violent but by moral measures. By this, they are distinguished from conspiracies and secret plots which are formed to attain a particular object through violent means. Secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> may be religious, scientific, political or social" (Kirchenlex., V, p. 519). Narrowing the definition still more to the technical meaning of secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> (<em>societates clandestinae</em>) in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> documents, Archbishop Katzer in a Pastoral (20 Jan., 1895) says: "The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has declared that she considers those <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> illicit and forbidden which (1) unite their members for the purpose of conspiring against the State or Church; (2) demand the observance of secrecy to such an extent that it must be maintained even before the rightful <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; (3) exact an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> from their members or a promise of blind and absolute obedience; (4) make use of a ritual and ceremonies that constitute them <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>."</p>

<h2 id="section2">Origin</h2>

<p>Though secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, in the modern and technical sense, did not exist in antiquity, yet there were various organizations which boasted an esoteric <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> known only to their members, and carefully concealed from the profane. Some date <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> of this kind back to Pythagoras (582-507 B.C.). The Eleusinian Mysteries, the secret teachings of <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and Druid hierarchies, the esoteric doctrines of the Magian and <a href="10402a.htm">Mithraic</a> worshippers furnished material for such secret organizations. In <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> times, such <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> as the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> and <a href="09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> also claimed to possess a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> known only to the illuminated and not to be shared with the vulgar. Likewise, the enemies of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order of <a href="14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a> maintained that the brothers of the Temple, while externally professing <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, were in reality <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> who veiled their impiety under <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> terms to which an entirely different meaning was given by the initiated. Originally, the various guilds of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> were in no sense secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> in the modern acceptation of the term, though some have supposed that symbolic <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> was gradually developed in those organizations. The fantastic <a href="13193b.htm">Rosicrucians</a> are credited with something of the nature of a modern secret <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, but the association, if such it was, can scarcely be said to have emerged into the clear light of history.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Modern organizations</h2>

<p>Secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> in the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> sense began with symbolic <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> about the year 1717 in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> (see <a href="09771a.htm">MASONRY</a>). This widespread oath-bound association soon became the exemplar or the parent of numerous other fraternities, nearly all of which have some connexion with <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a>, and in almost every instance were founded by <a href="09771a.htm">Masons</a>. Among these may be mentioned the <a href="07661b.htm">Illuminati</a>, the <a href="03330c.htm">Carbonari</a>, the Odd-Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, the Sons of Temperance and similar <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> whose number is legion. Based on the same principles as the secret order to which they are affiliated are the women-auxiliary lodges, of which almost every secret <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> has at least one. These secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> have also their rituals, their <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a>, and their degrees. Institutions of learning are also infected with the glamour of secret organizations and the "Eleusis" of Chi Omega (Fayetteville, Ark.) of 1 June, 1900, states that there are twenty-four Greek letter <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> with seven hundred and sixty-eight branches for male students, and eight similar <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> with one hundred and twenty branches for <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> students, and a total membership of 142,456 in the higher institutions of learning in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Attitude of ecclesiastical authorities</h2>

<p>The judgment of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on secret oath-bound associations has been made abundantly clear by <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> documents. <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> was condemned by <a href="04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> in a Constitution, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 28 April, 1738. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> insists on the objectionable character of <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> that commit men of all or no religion to a system of mere natural righteousness, that seek their end by binding their votaries to secret pacts by strict <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a>, often under penalties of the severest character, and that plot against the tranquillity of the State. <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> renewed the condemnation of his predecessor on 18 May, 1751. The <a href="03330c.htm">Carbonari</a> were declared a prohibited <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> by <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in a Constitution <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 Sept., 1821, and he made it manifest that organizations similar to <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> involve an equal condemnation. The <a href="01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> "Quo Graviora" of <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> (18 March, 1825) put together the acts and decrees of former pontiffs on the subject of secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> and ratified and confirmed them. The dangerous character and tendencies of secret organizations among students did not escape the vigilance of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and <a href="12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> (24 May, 1829) raised his warning voice concerning those in colleges and academies, as his predecessor, <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, had done in the matter of <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>. The succeeding <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> (15 Aug., 1832) and <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (9 Nov., 1846; 20 Apr., 1849; 9 Dec., 1854; 8 Dec., 1864; 25 Sept., 1865), continued to warn the faithful against secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> and to renew the ban of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on their designs and members. On 20 Apr., 1884, appeared the famous <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, "Humanum Genus." In it the pontiff says: "As soon as the constitution and spirit of the <a href="09771a.htm">masonic</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> were clearly discovered by manifest signs of its action, by cases investigated, by the publication of its <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and of its rites and commentaries, with the addition often of the personal testimony of those who were in the secret, the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> denounced the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> and publicly declared its constitution as contrary to law and right, to be pernicious no less to <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> than to the State; and it forbade anyone to enter the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, under the penalties which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is wont to inflict upon exceptionally guilty <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. The sectaries, indignant at this, thinking to elude or to weaken the force of these decrees, partly by contempt of them and partly by <a href="03190c.htm">calumny</a>, accused the <a href="12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiffs</a> who had uttered them, either of exceeding the bounds of moderation or of decreeing what was not just. This was the manner in which they endeavoured to elude the authority and weight of the Apostolic Constitutions of <a href="04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> and <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, as well as of <a href="12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> and <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. Yet in the very <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> itself there were found men who unwillingly acknowledged that the Roman Pontiffs had acted within their right, according to the <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and discipline. The pontiffs received the same assent, and in strong terms, from many princes and heads of governments, who made it their business either to delate the <a href="09771a.htm">masonic</a> <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, or of their own accord by special enactments to brand it as pernicious, as for example in <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and other parts of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. But, what is of the highest importance, the course of events has demonstrated the <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> of our predecessors." <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> makes it clear that it is not only the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> explicitly called <a href="09771a.htm">Masonic</a> that is objectionable: "There are several organized bodies which, though they differ in name, in ceremonial, in form and origin, are nevertheless so bound together by community of purpose and by the similarity of their main opinions as to make in fact one thing with the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasons</a>, which is a kind of centre whence they all go forth and whither they all return. Now, these no longer show a desire to remain concealed; for they hold their meetings in the daylight and before the public eye, and publish their own newspaper organs; and yet, when thoroughly understood they are found still to retain the nature and the habits of secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>." The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> is not unmindful of the professed benevolent aims of these <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>: "They speak of their <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for a more cultured refinement and of their <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of the poor; and they declare their one wish to be the amelioration of the condition of the masses, and to share with the largest possible number all the benefits of civil life. Even were these purposes aimed at in real <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, yet they are by no means the whole of their object. Moreover, to be enrolled it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that candidates promise and undertake to be thenceforward strictly obedient to their leaders and masters with the utmost submission and fidelity, and to be in readiness to do their bidding upon the slightest expression of their will." The pontiff then points out the dire consequences which result from the fact that these <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> substitute <a href="10713a.htm">Naturalism</a> for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ and inculcate, at the very least, indifferentism in matters of religion. Other <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> utterances on secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> are: "Ad Apostolici," 15 Oct., 1890; "Praeclara," 20 June, 1894; "Annum Ingressi," 18 Mar., 1902.</p>

<p>The extension of the decrees of the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> in regard to <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> hitherto forbidden under censure is summed up in the well-known Constitution <a href="01645a.htm">"Apostolicae Sedis"</a> of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, where <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> is pronounced against those "who give their names to the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="09771a.htm">masons</a> or <a href="03330c.htm">Carbonari</a> or any other <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> of the same nature, which conspire against the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or lawfully constituted Governments, either openly or covertly, as well as those who favor in any manner these <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> or who do not denounce their leaders and chiefs." The condemned <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> here described are associations formed to antagonize the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or the lawful <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>. A <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> to be of the same kind as the <a href="09771a.htm">Masonic</a>, must also be a secret organization. It is of no consequence whether the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> demand an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to observe its secrets or not. It is plain also that public and avowed attacks on Church or State are quite compatible with a secret organization. It must not supposed, however, that only <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> which fall directly under the formal censure of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> are prohibited. The Congregation of the Holy Office issued an instruction on 10 May, 1884, in which it says: "That there maybe no possibility of <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> when there is a question of judging which of these pernicious <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> fall under censure or mere prohibition, it is certain in the first place, that the <a href="09771a.htm">Masonic</a> and other <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> of the same nature are <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, whether they exact or do not exact an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> from their members to observe secrecy. Besides these, there are other prohibited <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, to be avoided under grave <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and among which are especially to be noted those which under <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>, communicate a secret to their members to be concealed from everybody else, and which demand absolute obedience to unknown leaders." To the secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> condemned by name, the Congregation of the Holy Office, on 20 Aug., 1894, in a <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> addressed to the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, added the Odd-Fellows, the Sons of Temperance, and the Knights of Pythias.</p>

<h2 id="section6">Recently condemned societies</h2>

<p>The order of Odd-Fellows was formed in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1812 as a completed organization, though some lodges date back to 1745; and it was introduced into America in 1819. In the "Odd-Fellows' Improved Pocket Manual" the author writes: "Our institution has instinctively, as it were, copied after all secret associations of religious and moral character." The "North-West Odd-Fellow Review" (May, 1895) declares: "No home can be an ideal one unless the principles of our good and glorious Order are represented therein, and its teachings made the rule of life." In the "New Odd-Fellows' Manual" (N.Y., 1895) the author says: "The written as well as the unwritten secret work of the Order, I have sacredly kept unrevealed," though the book is dedicated "to all inquirers who desire to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> what Odd-Fellowship really is." This book tells us "Odd-Fellowship was founded on great religious principles" (p. 348); "we use forms of worship" (p. 364); "Judaism, Christianity, <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> recognize the only living and <a href="06608a.htm">true God</a>" (p. 297). The Odd-Fellows have <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a>, altars, high-priests, ritual, order of worship, and funeral ceremonies.</p>

<p>The order of the Sons of Temperance was founded in New York in 1842 and introduced into <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1846. The "Cyclopaedia of Fraternities" says (p. 409): "The Sons of Temperance took the lead in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in demonstrating the propriety and practicability of both men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> mingling in secret <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> lodges." That the object of this order and its kindred <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> is not confined to temperance "is evidenced by its mode of initiation, the form of the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> and the manner of religious worship" (Rosen, p. 162).</p>

<p>The order of the Knights of Pythias was founded in 1864 by prominent <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> (Cyclop. of Fraternities, p. 263). In number, its membership is second only to that of the Odd-Fellows. Rosen (The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and Secret Societies) says: "The principal objectionable features, on account of which the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has forbidden its members to join the Knights of Pythias, and demanded a withdrawal of those who joined it, are: First, the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of secrecy by which the member binds himself to keep secret whatever concerns the doings of the Order, even from those in <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> who have a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>, under certain conditions, what their subjects are doing. Secondly, this <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> binds the member to blind obedience, which is symbolized by a test. Such an obedience is against the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of man's nature, and against all divine and human law. Thirdly, Christ is not the teacher and model in the rule of life but the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> Pythagoras and the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> Damon, Pythias and Dionysius" (p. 160). The "Ritual for the subordinate Lodges of the Knights of Pythias" (Chicago, 1906) shows that this organization has <a href="11176a.htm">oaths</a>, degrees, <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and a ritual that contains religious worship.</p>

<p>The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Holy Office concerning the Odd-Fellows, Sons of Temperance, and Knights of Pythias, though not declaring them to be condemned under censure, says: "The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> must endeavour by all means to keep the faithful from joining all and each of the three aforesaid <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>; and warn the faithful against them, and if, after proper monition, they still determine to be members of these <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, or do not effectually separate themselves from them, they are to be forbidden the reception of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. A <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of 18 Jan., 1896, allows a nominal membership in these three <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, if in the judgment of the <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>, four conditions are fulfilled: that the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was entered in <a href="06642a.htm">good faith</a>, that there be no <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a>, that grave temporal injury would result from withdrawal, and that there be no danger of perversion. The delegate, in granting a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, usually requires a promise that the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> will not attend any meetings or frequent the lodge-rooms, that the dues be sent in by mail or by a third party, and that in case of death the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> will have nothing to do with the funeral.</p>

<h2 id="section7">Orders of women</h2>

<p>In regard to <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, the Apostolic delegation at Washington, 2 Aug., 1907, declared (Ans. no. 15,352-C): "If these <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> are affiliated to <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> already nominally condemned by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, they fall under the same condemnation, for they form, as it were, a branch of such <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>. As regards other <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> which may not be affiliated with <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> condemned expressly by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the confessor must in cases of members belonging to such <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, apply the principles of <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a> which treat of secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> in general." The document adds that members of <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> affiliated to the three <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> condemned in 1894 will be dealt with by the <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> in the same manner as male members when the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> conditions are fulfilled.</p>

<h2 id="section8">Trades unions</h2>

<p>The Third Council of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (no. 253) declares: "We see no reason why the prohibition of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> against the <a href="09771a.htm">Masonic</a> and other secret <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> should be extended to organizations of workingmen, which have no other object in view than mutual protection and aid for their members in the practice of their trades. Care must be taken, however, that nothing, be admitted under any pretext which favors condemned <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>; or that the workingmen who belong to these organizations be induced, by the cunning arts of wicked men, to withhold, contrary to the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, the labor due from them, or in any other manner violate the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of their employers. Those associations are entirely illicit, in which the members are so bound for mutual defense that danger of riots and <a href="07441a.htm">murders</a> is the outcome."</p>

<h2 id="section9">Method of condemnation</h2>

<p>Finally, in regard to the condemnation of individual <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the council says (no. 255): "To avoid confusion of discipline which ensues, to the great <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> of the faithful and the detriment of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, when the same <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> is condemned in one diocese and tolerated in another, we desire that no <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> be condemned by name as falling under one of the classes [of forbidden <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>] before the Ordinary has brought the matter before a commission which we now constitute for judging such cases, and which will consist of all the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of these provinces. If it be not plain to all that a society is to be condemned, recourse must be had to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in order that a definite judgment be obtained and that uniform discipline may be preserved in these provinces".</p>
