<p>(FELICE PERETTI).</p>

<p>Born at Grottamare near <a href="10516a.htm">Montalto</a>, 13 December, 1521; elected 24 April, 1585; <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> 1 May, 1585; died in the Quirinal, 27 August, 1590. He belonged to a <a href="04606b.htm">Dalmatian</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> which in the middle of the preceding century had fled to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> from the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> who were devastating <a href="07663a.htm">Illyria</a> and threatened to invade <a href="04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>. His father was a gardener and it is said of Felice that, when a boy, he was a swineherd. At the age of nine he came to the <a href="06281a.htm">Minorite</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="10516a.htm">Montalto</a>, where his uncle, Fra Salvatore, was a friar. Here he became a <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> at the age of twelve. He was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="10516a.htm">Montalto</a>, <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and Bologna and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> in 1547. The talented young <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> gained a high reputation as a preacher. At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where in 1552 he preached the <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> sermons in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Santi Apostoli, his successful preaching gained for him the friendship of very influential men, such as Cardinal Carpi, the protector of his order; the Cardinals Caraffa and Ghislieri, both of whom became <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>; <a href="12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> and St. Ignatius. He was successively appointed <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of his <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a> in 1550, of San Lorenzo at <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> in 1553, and of the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Frari at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1556. A year later <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> appointed him also counselor to the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>. His <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and severity in the capacity of inquisitor displeased the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Government, which demanded and obtained his recall in 1560. Having returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was made counsellor to the Holy Office, professor at the Sapienza, and general <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> and <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of his order. In 1565 <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> designated him to accompany to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> Cardinal Buoncompagni (afterwards <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>), who was to investigate a charge of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> against <a href="03376a.htm">Archbishop Carranza</a> of Toledo. From this time dates the antipathy between Peretti and Buoncompagni, which declared itself more openly during the latter's pontificate (1572-85). Upon his return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1566 <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> created him <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sant' Agata dei Goti in the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> and later chose him as his confessor. On 17 May, 1570, the same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> created him <a href="03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> with the titular Church of S. Simeone, which he afterwards exchanged for that of S. Girolamo dei Schiavoni. In 1571 he was transferred to the <a href="06043c.htm">See of Fermo</a>. He was popularly known as the Cardinal di Montalto. During the pontificate of <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> he withdrew from public affairs, devoting himself to study and to the collection of works of art, as far as his scanty means permitted. During this time he edited the works of <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (Rome, 1579-1585) and erected a villa (now Villa Massimi) on the Esquiline.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> died on 10 April 1585, and after a <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> of four days Peretti was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by "adoration" on 24 April, 1585. He took the name Sixtus V in memory of <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, who had also been a <a href="06281a.htm">Minorite</a>. The legend that he entered the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> on crutches, feigning the infirmities of old age, and upon his election exultantly thrust aside his crutches and appeared full of life and vigour has long been exploded; it may, however, have been invented as a symbol of his forced inactivity during the reign of <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> and the remarkable energy which he displayed during the five years of his pontificate. He was a born ruler and especially suited to stem the tide of disorder and lawlessness which had broken out towards the end of the reign of <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. Having obtained the co-operation of the neighbouring states, he exterminated, often with excessive cruelty, the system of brigandage which had reached immense proportions and terrorized the whole of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The number of bandits in and about <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the death of <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> has been variously estimated at from twelve to twenty-seven thousand, and in little more than two years after the accession of Sixtus V the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> had become the most secure country in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>.</p>

<p>Of almost equal importance with the extermination of the bandits was, in the opinion of Sixtus V, the rearrangement of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> finances. At his accession the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> exchequer was empty. Acting on his favourite principle that riches as well as severity are <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for good government, he used every available means to replenish the state treasury. So successful was he in the accumulation of money that, despite his enormous expenditures for public buildings, he had shortly before his death deposited in the Castello di Sant' Angelo three million scudi in gold and one million six hundred thousand in silver. He did not consider that in the long run so much dead capital withdrawn from circulation was certain to impoverish the country and deal the death-blow to commerce and industry. To obtain such vast sums he economized everywhere, except in works of architecture; increased the number of salable public offices; imposed more taxes and extended the monti, or public loans, that had been instituted by <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>. Though extremely economical in other ways, Sixtus V spent immense sums in erection of public works. He built the Lateran Palace; completed the Quirinal; restored the <a href="03041a.htm">Church</a> of Santa Sabina on the Aventine; rebuilt the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and Hospice of San Girolamo dei Schiavoni; enlarged and improved the Sapienza; founded the hospice for the poor near the Ponte Sisto; built and richly ornamented the Chapel of the Cradle in the Basilica of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore; completed the <a href="04569d.htm">cupola</a> of St. Peter's; raised the obelisks of the Vatican, of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore, of the Lateran, and of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> del Popolo; restored the columns of <a href="15015a.htm">Trajan</a> and of <a href="01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a>, placing the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of St. Peter on the former and that of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> on the latter; erected the Vatican Library with its adjoining printing-office and that wing of the Vatican Palace which is inhabited by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; built many magnificent streets; erected various <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; and supplied <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with water, the "Acqua Felice", which he brought to the city over a distance of twenty miles, partly under ground, partly on elevated aqueducts. At Bologna he founded the Collegio Montalto for fifty students from the <a href="01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>.</p>

<p>Far-reaching were the reforms which Sixtus V introduced in the management of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. On 3 Dec., 1586, he issued the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Postquam verus", fixing the number of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> at seventy, namely, six <a href="03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a>, fifty <a href="03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priests</a>, and fourteen <a href="03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacons</a>. Before his pontificate, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> business was generally discharged by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in consistory with the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. There were, indeed, a few permanent <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalitial</a> congregations, but the sphere of their competency was very limited. In his <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Immensa aeterni Dei", of 11 February, 1588, he established fifteen permanent congregations, some of which were concerned with spiritual, others with temporal affairs. They were the Congregations: (1) of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>; (2) of the Segnatura; (3) for the Establishment of Churches; (4) of Rites and Ceremonies; (5) of the Index of Forbidden Books; (6) of the Council of Trent (7); of the Regulars; (8) of the Bishops; (9) of the Vatican Press; (10) of the Annona, for the provisioning of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the provinces; (11) of the Navy; (12) of the Public Welfare; (13) of the Sapienza; (14) of Roads, Bridges, and Waters; (15) of State Consultations. These congregations lessened the work of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, without in any way limiting his authority. The final decision belonged to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. In the creation of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> Sixtus V was, as a rule, guided by their good qualities. The only suspicion of nepotism with which he might be reproached was giving the purple to his fourteen-year-old grand-nephew Alessandro, who, however did <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> and never wielded an undue influence.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1588 he issued from the Vatican Press an edition of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> revised according to a Vatican <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> His edition of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, printed shortly before his death, was withdrawn from circulation on account of its many <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>, corrected, and reissued in 1592 (see <a href="02411d.htm">ROBERT "../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, he objected to some of their rules and especially to the title "Society of Jesus". He was on the point of changing these when death overtook him. A <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/BELLARMINE"</a>). Though a friend of the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> which had been erected in his <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> on the Capitol during his lifetime was torn down by the rabble immediately upon his death.
