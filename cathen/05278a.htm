<p>R<font size=-2>EPUBLIC OF</font> E<font size=-2>CUADOR</font> (L<font size=-2>A</font> R<font size=-2>EP&Uacute;BLICA DEL</font> E<font size=-2>CUADOR</font>).</p>

<p>An independent state of South America, bounded on the north by <a href="04121b.htm">Colombia</a>, on the east by <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, on the south by <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The northwest corner of the state is crossed by the equator, hence its name.</p>

<p>No part of America has been so prominent for scientific explorations, specially <a href="06447a.htm">geographic</a> and physiographic, carried out on a large scale in the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth century. One, sent out in 1735 by the <a href="06166a.htm">French Government</a> for the purpose of measuring the meridian near the equator, recalls the names of <a href="04210a.htm">La Condamine</a> and Bouguer. The other (1790-1804) forever associates Alexander von Humboldt with the history of the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a>.</p>

<h2>Area, physical features, etc.</h2>

<p>Ecuador is the third smallest of the South American republics. It forms, approximately, an isosceles triangle wedged in between <a href="04121b.htm">Colombia</a> and <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>. Indenting the southwest coast is the Gulf of <a href="07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a> within which lies the large island of Pun&aacute;. As in the case of other South American republics, the boundaries of Ecuador are ill-defined and subject to modification by treaty. Its area is variously given as from 80,300 to 152,000 sq. miles, to which must be added the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific, lying about 90&#176;-92&#176; west long., 10 degrees off the coast, and covering from 2490 to 3000 sq. miles. These islands are about ten in number, only one of which (Isabella or Albemarie) is inhabited by some two hundred people.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The eastern half of Ecuador is low, wooded, and traversed by many rivers emptying into the Mara&ntilde;on or Upper Amazon; the western is very mountainous, the high Andes chain dividing the two sections. The mountain chain runs nearly due south from the southern boundary of <a href="04121b.htm">Colombia</a> to the <a href="11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> frontier. It has a number of high peaks, all of volcanic origin, among them Chimborazo (20, 500 ft.) and many volcanoes. Of the latter, Cotopaxi (19,613 ft.), Tunguragua (16,690 ft.) and Sangai (17,454 ft.) are still active; Antisana (19,335 ft.); Pichincha (15,918 ft.), etc. have been extinct for a century or more, while Altar, Cotocachi, etc., show traces only of activity in ages long past.</p>

<p>The Ecuadorian table-land and higher mountain valleys are temperate, though the temperature is low in the greater altitudes. The year is divided into the dry and the wet season. Under the Equator, however, there is little difference between the seasons. The coast valleys and shores are very hot, and the climate generally unhealthful.</p>

<p>Ecuador has but one navigable river, the Guayas, which empties into the Gulf of <a href="07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>. The other streams of Western Ecuador are of little importance. The flora is luxuriant except in high altitudes. Both lower slopes of the Andes are densely wooded. On the coast there is an arid zone of limited extent; the larger portion, however, is very fertile as far as the <a href="11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> boundary at Tumbez. The inland forests in the south are rich in Chicona bark, and extend easterly to a height of nearly 10,000 feet. Then follows a sub-Andean zone for the next 3500 feet, in which cereals thrive in an average temperature of from 53&#176; to 59&#176; Fahr. This is followed by what are called the <em>p&aacute;ramos</em>, cold and stormy wastes, treeless and exposed to daily snows, which reach an altitude of 15,000 feet above sea level, and where the tough puna-grass flourishes. On the eastern slope of the Andes dense forests are found again and the cinnamon tree. Animal life is tropical and found in proportion to the vegetation.</p>

<p>As far as known, Ecuador is fairly rich in minerals. It is the only South American state, with the exception of <a href="04121b.htm">Colombia</a>, where emeralds have been found in any quantity (near the coast at Manta and Esmeraldas); their location, however, is uncertain.</p>

<p>The population is estimated at 1,272,000, of whom about 20,000 are supposed to be Indians. Exact statistics, however, do not exist. Of the 400,000, one-half is allowed to the wild forest-tribes of the eastern section and the other half to the remnants of the diverse sedentary tribes which formerly occupied the table-land and coast. The whole country is divided into fifteen provinces besides the Eastern territory and the Galapagos Islands.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Of the pre-Columbian conditions and languages of the Indians of Ecuador little is known. The coast tribes have almost disappeared, and those of the higher regions have adopted <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> customs. That they differed from the <a href="11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> Quicha seems likely. The best known were the Ca&ntilde;aris, the Carangas, and the Puruaes or Puruays; a tribe known as the Scyri is mentioned in the neighbourhood of <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a>. They were all sedentary; <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> how to work gold, silver, copper, and possibly bronze; and practiced the <a href="06052b.htm">fetishism</a> common to primitive Americans. The coast tribe built their houses of wood and cane while those of the interior used stone. They were skillful navigators, some of their vessels being estimated at thirty tons, and propelled by oars and cotton sails.</p>

<p>The <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, led by <a href="12140a.htm">Francisco Pizarro</a>, first saw the coast of Ecuador in 1525. From Tacamez, or Atacames, where they touched, <a href="12140a.htm">Pizarro</a> dispatched Ruiz, his pilot, to the south. In the account of <a href="12140a.htm">Pizarro</a> we have the earliest description of the Ecuadorian coast and people. He sailed south beyond the present limits of <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>, verifying his pilot's reports, and in 1528 returned to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> to prepare for the conquest of <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>. He returned in 1531, landed at Coaque, and, marching south along the shore, established himself, despite the hostility of the natives, on the island of Pun&aacute;. The permanent <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> occupation of Ecuador, however, began in 1534, from Piura to <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a> under Sebastian de Belalcazar. He had a tedious campaign to <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a>, in which he was assisted by Ca&ntilde;aris. In 1534, three towns were established; San Francisco de <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a> (15 August) at <a href="13061c.htm">Riobamba</a>, thirteen days later transferred to its present site, Chimbo; and <a href="07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a>, also originally founded at a place distinct from the one it now occupies. Meanwhile <a href="01372d.htm">Pedro de Alvarado</a> had landed on the coast with a considerable force from <a href="07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>. Reaching the central plateau, he was confronted by Belalcazar and <a href="01326e.htm">Diego de Almagro the elder</a>. An amicable agreement was reached, and Gonzalo Pizarro pushed into the cinnamon country, but made little headway and had to turn back. His lieutenant, Orellana, however, floated down the Amazon, and landed on the Isle of Trinidad, whence he carries to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> the first information about southeastern Ecuador.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The second epoch of civil <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> in <a href="11732b.htm">Peru</a>, the uprising of Gonzalo Pizarro against the viceroy Nu&ntilde;ez de la Vela, came to an end with the defeat and death of the viceroy near <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a>, 16 Jan., 1546. <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a> became the headquarters of the Crown's representative, and with this as a basis, the independence movement was put down. During the colonial period the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> founded institutions of learning such as the University of <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a> and established a printing press at the same place in 1760. Political disturbances were few, but during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries volcanic and seismic phenomena were frequent and often disastrous. An attempt was made in 1809 to overthrow the <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> power, and Ecuador, <a href="04121b.htm">Colombia</a>, and <a href="15327a.htm">Venezuela</a>, together with the rest of <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> South America, then engaged in efforts toward independence. In 1820 <a href="07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a> succeeded in throwing off <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> control, and the battle of Pichincha (22 May, 1822) finally put an end to the domination of the mother country. Ecuador, with <a href="04121b.htm">Colombia</a> and <a href="15327a.htm">Venezuela</a>, next formed an independent confederacy until 1830, when the union was dissolved and the first Ecuadorian congress met. Since then Ecuador has been toward by internal dissensions and foreign complications, chiefly with <a href="04121b.htm">Colombia</a>. The opposing political parties are the Conservatives, or Clericals, and the Liberals. Since 1893 the latter have been in power and have to a great extent adopted a policy of secularization in church matters. From 1833 to 1908 Ecuador has had nineteen presidents.</p>

<h2>Government, education, etc.</h2>

<p>Ecuador is a constitutional republic. From 1830 to 1883 it had no less than ten constitutions; the last was adopted in 1897. The executive head is the president, elected with the vice-president directly by the people for a term of four years. The senators (30) and the deputies (41) are also elected by direct vote, the former for four, the latter for two years. Congress meets biennially at <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a>, the capital, on 10 August, and is in session for sixty days. The principal cities are: <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a> (80,000); <a href="07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a> (51,000); <a href="04562a.htm">Cuenca</a> (30,000); <a href="13061c.htm">Riobamba</a> (18,000), and five of ten thousand or more inhabitants. <a href="07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a> is the chief seaport. In 1904 Ecuador had 168 miles of railroad and 2565 miles of telegraph, both of which have since been added to. The monetary unit is the <em>sucre</em>, about equal to the <em>peso</em> of other Spanish-American countries, but subject to fluctuation in value. The chief exports are cacao, vegetable <a href="08257b.htm">ivory</a>, india-rubber, and straw hats.</p>

<p>Educational statistics are scanty. There is a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a> with thirty-two professors and two hundred and sixteen students (1905). Institutions of higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> are found at <a href="07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a> and <a href="04562a.htm">Cuenca</a>. The number of secondary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> is 35; primary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> 1088 with 1498 teachers and 68,380 pupils; and 9 high schools and colleges.</p>

<h2>Religion</h2>

<p>Soon after the discovery of the country missionaries began their labour in Ecuador and in 1545 the <a href="12615b.htm">Bishopric of Quito</a> was erected. Work among the different <a href="07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> on the tributaries of the Amazon was difficult, and the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> missions were destroyed in 1599 by the savage <a href="08405a.htm">Jivaros</a>. Later, however, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> re-established themselves and were assisted by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who had been in <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a> since 1596. By the close of the seventeenth century Ecuador was well-evangelized, but after the expulsion of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1767, who on the Napo alone had thirty-three missions with 100,000 inhabitants, the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were unable to keep up the work and the natives fell back into <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>. The revolution destroyed all traces of two hundred years of untiring labour. Since 1848 Ecuador has formed an <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. The population is <a href="03744a.htm">Catholic</a> except for a small number of foreigners and a few <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> Indians in the East.</p>

<p>Up to 1861 the government was in the hands of the Liberal and largely anti-Catholic party. When <a href="06379b.htm">Garcia Moreno</a> was elected president (1861-65 and 1869-75), however, he reorganized civil and religious affairs. Under him a <a href="04196a.htm">Concordat</a> (20 November, 1863) was concluded with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were erected, <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and missions given to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (who had been recalled), and others, and in 1864, at the time of the spolation of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, ten percent of the state's income was guaranteed to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="06379b.htm">Moreno</a> was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> 6 Aug., 1875, and his death not only put an end to the concordat, but under the new regime which succeeded him a series of persecutions occurred. In 1885, when Bishop Schumacher took charge, nearly all the native <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were suspended and replaced by <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a> and practically a new <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> established. The religious and moral <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the people was likewise in bad condition. The revolution of Alfaro in 1895 was a severe blow to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The orders, among them the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, Missionaries of Steyl, and the various sisterhoods, were all banished and Bishop Schumacher <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee.</p>

<p>The State religion is the <a href="03744a.htm">Catholic</a>, but other creeds are not interfered with.

At the same time it was enacted that no new or foreign <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order would be permitted in the country. Suffragan to <a href="12615b.htm">Quito</a>, which became an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> in 1848, are: <a href="04562a.htm">Cuenca</a> (1786), <a href="07054b.htm">Guayaquil</a> (1837), <a href="07613c.htm">Ibarra</a> (1862), <a href="09332b.htm">Loja</a> (1866), Puerto Viejo, or <a href="12294a.htm">Porto Viejo</a> (1871), <a href="13061c.htm">Riobamba</a> (1863).
