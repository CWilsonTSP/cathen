<p>(Also called MASHTOTS)</p>

<p>One of the greatest figures in <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> history, he was born about 361 at Hassik in the Province of Taron; died at Valarsabad, 441. He was the son of Vartan of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the Mamikonians. Goriun, his pupil and biographer, tells us that Mesrob received a liberal <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and was versed in the Greek, Syriac, and Persian languages. On account of his <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning Mesrob was appointed secretary to King Chosroes III. His <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> was to write in Greek, <a href="11712a.htm">Persian</a>, and Syriac characters the decrees and edicts of the sovereign, for, at this time, there was no national alphabet. But Mesrob felt called to a more perfect life. Leaving the court for the service of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, he took <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and withdrew to a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> with a few chosen companions. There, says Goriun, he practised great austerities, enduring hunger and thirst, cold and poverty. He lived on vegetables, wore a hair shirt, slept upon the ground, and often spent whole nights in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the study of the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. This life he continued for a few years, preparing himself for the great work to which Providence was soon to call him. Indeed both <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> needed his services. <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, so long the battle-ground of Romans and <a href="11712a.htm">Persians</a>, lost its independence in 387, and was divided between the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> and <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>, about four-fifths being given to the latter. Western <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a> was governed by Greek generals, while an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> king ruled, but only as feudatory, over Persian <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was naturally influenced by these violent political changes, although the loss of civil independence and the partition of the land could not destroy its organization or subdue its spirit. Persecution only quickened it into greater activity, and had the effect of bringing the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the nobles, and the common people closer together. The principal events of this period are the invention of the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> alphabet, the revision of the liturgy, the creation of an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and national literature, and the readjustment of hierarchical relations. Three men are prominently associated with this stupendous work: Mesrob, Patriarch Isaac, and King Vramshapuh, who succeeded his brother Chosroes III in 394.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Mesrob, as we have noted, had spent some time in a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> preparing for a missionary life. With the support of Prince Shampith, he preached the Gospel in the district of Golthn near the Araxes, converting many <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>. However, he experienced great difficulty in instructing the people, for the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> had no alphabet of their own, but used the Greek, <a href="11712a.htm">Persian</a>, and Syriac scripts, none of which was well suited for representing the many complex sounds of their native tongue. Again, the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the liturgy, being written in Syriac, were, to a large extent, unintelligible to the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Hence the constant need of translators and interpreters to explain the Word of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to the people. Mesrob, desirous to remedy this state of things, resolved to invent a national alphabet, in which undertaking Isaac and King Vramshapuh promised to assist him. It is hard to determine exactly what part Mesrob had in the fixing of the new alphabet. According to his <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> biographers, he consulted Daniel, a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Mesopotamia, and Rufinus, a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="13422a.htm">Samosata</a>, on the matter. With their help and that of Isaac and the king, he was able to give a definite form to the alphabet, which he probably adapted from the Greek. Others, like Lenormant, think it derived from the Zend. Mesrob's alphabet consisted of thirty-six letters; two more (long O and F) were added in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>The invention of the alphabet (406) was the beginning of <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> literature, and <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> a powerful factor in the upbuilding of the national spirit. "The result of the work of Isaac and Mesrob", says St. Martin (Histoire du Bas-Empire de Lebeau, V, 320), "was to separate for ever the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> from the other peoples of the East, to make of them a distinct nation, and to strengthen them in the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> by forbidding or rendering profane all the foreign alphabetic scripts which were employed for transcribing the books of the <a href="11388a.htm">heathens</a> and of the followers of Zoroaster. To Mesrob we owe the preservation of the language and literature of <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>; but for his work, the people would have been absorbed by the <a href="11712a.htm">Persians</a> and Syrians, and would have disappeared like so many nations of the East". Anxious that others should profit by his discovery, and encouraged by the patriarch and the king, Mesrob founded numerous <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in different parts of the country, in which the youth were taught the new alphabet. But his activity was not confined to Eastern <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. Provided with letters from Isaac he went to Constantinople and obtained from the Emperor Theodosius the Younger permission to preach and teach in his <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> possessions. He evangelized successively the Georgians, <a href="01253b.htm">Albanians</a>, and Aghouanghks, adapting his alphabet to their languages, and, wherever he preached the Gospel, he built <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and appointed teachers and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to continue his work. Having returned to Eastern <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a> to report on his missions to the patriarch, his first thought was to provide a religious literature for his countrymen. Having gathered around him numerous disciples, he sent some to <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, Constantinople, <a href="02046a.htm">Athens</a>, <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Alexandria, and other centres of learning, to study the Greek language and bring back the masterpieces of Greek literature. The most famous of his pupils were John of Egheghiatz, Joseph of Baghin, Eznik, Goriun, <a href="10598a.htm">Moses of Chorene</a>, and John Mandakuni.</p>

<p>The first monument of this <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> literature is the version of the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Isaac, says <a href="10598a.htm">Moses of Chorene</a>, made a translation of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> from the Syriac text about 411. This work must have been considered imperfect, for soon afterwards John of Egheghiatz and Joseph of Baghin were sent to <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> to translate the Scriptures. They journeyed as far as Constantinople, and brought back with them authentic copies of the Greek text. With the help of other copies obtained from Alexandria the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> was translated again from the Greek according to the text of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> and <a href="11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <a href="07316a.htm">Hexapla</a>. This version, now in use in the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church, was completed about 434. The decrees of the first three councils &mdash; Nic&aelig;a, Constantinople, and Ephesus &mdash; and the national liturgy (so far written in Syriac) were also translated into <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, the latter being revised on the <a href="02321a.htm">liturgy of St. Basil</a>, though retaining characteristics of its own. Many works of the <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> also passed into <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>. The loss of the Greek originals has given some of these versions a special importance; thus, the second part of <a href="05616a.htm">Eusebius's "Chronicle"</a>, of which only a few fragments exist in the Greek, has been preserved entire in <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>. In the midst of his literary labours Mesrob did not neglect the spiritual needs of the people. He revisited the districts he had evangelized in his earlier years, and, after the death of Isaac in 440, looked after the spiritual administration of the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. He survived his friend and master only six months. The <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> read his name in the Canon of the Mass, and celebrate his memory on 19 February.</p>
