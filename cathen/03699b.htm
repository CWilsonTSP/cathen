<p>In its <strong>wider sense</strong> this term is used to describe the part of the world which is inhabited by <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was the country inhabited by Germans. The word will be taken in this quantitative sense in the article <a href="14275a.htm">R<font size=-2>ELIGIONS</font></a> in comparing the extent of Christendom with that of <a href="11388a.htm">Paganism</a> or of <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a>.</p>

<p>But there is a <strong>narrower sense</strong> in which Christendom stands for a polity as well as a religion, for a nation as well as for a people. Christendom in this sense was an ideal which inspired and dignified many centuries of history and which has not yet altogether lost its power over the minds of men.</p>

<p>The foundations of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> polity are to be found in the traditions of the Jewish theocracy softened and broadened by <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> cosmopolitanism, in the completeness with which <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> principles were applied to the whole of life, in the aloofness of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities from the world around them, and in the hierarchical organization of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The conflict between the new religion and the Roman Empire was due partly to the very thoroughness of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> system and it naturally emphasized the distinction between this new <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> and the old state. Thus when Constantine proclaimed the Peace of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> he might almost be described as signing a treaty between two powers. From that Peace to the time of the Barbarian inroads into the West, Christendom was all but conterminous with the Roman Empire, and it might be thought that the ideal of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> nation was then at least realized. The legal privileges which were granted to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the first and which tended to increase, the protection given to the churches and the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the principle admitted by the emperors that questions of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> were to be freely decided by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> &mdash; all these concessions seemed to show that the empire had become positively as well as negatively <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. To <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the fourth century the destruction of the empire seemed almost incredible except as a phase of the final catastrophe, and the system which prevailed in the delays of <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> seemed almost the ideal <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> polity.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Yet there was about it much that fell short of the ideal of Christendom. In many ways, as a contemporary <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> expressed it, "the church was in the empire, not the empire in the church". The traditions of Roman imperialism were too strong to be easily mitigated. Constantine, though not even a <a href="03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, in a sense at least, presided over the <a href="11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> and the "Divinity" of his son <a href="16027c.htm">Constantius</a>, though formally observing the rule that decisions of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> belonged to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, was able to exert such pressure upon them that at one time not a single strictly <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was left in the occupation of his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. The officious interference of a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> emperor was more dangerous to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> than the hostility of <a href="08558b.htm">Julian</a>, his successor. But the wish to dominate in every sphere was not the only relic of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Though the emperor was no longer pontifex maximus and the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of Victory was removed from the senate house, though <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> decreed the final closing of the <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> and put an end to <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> public worship, the ancient world was not really converted; it was hardly a <a href="03430b.htm">catechumen</a>. In philosophy, literature, and art it clung to the old models and reproduced them in a debased form. <a href="11388a.htm">Pagan</a> civilization had not been <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of a simpler character and a more spontaneous vigour than the inhabitants of the degenerate empire. The formation of Christendom was to be the work of a new generation of nations, <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in their infancy and receiving even the message of the ancient world from the lips of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers.</p>

<p>But it was to be long before the great future hidden in the Barbarian inversions was to become manifest. At their first irruption the influence of the Teutonic tribes was only destructive; the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> polity seemed to be perishing with the empire. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, as a spiritual power survived and mitigated even the fury of the Barbarian, for the helpless population of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> found a refuge in the churches during the sack of the city by Alaric in 410. The distinction between church and empire, which this disaster illustrated, was emphasized by the accusations brought against the patriotism of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and by <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> reply in his <a href="../fathers/1201.htm">"De Civitate Dei"</a>. He develops in this encyclopedic treatise the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the two kingdoms or <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> (<em>city</em>, except in a very metaphorical sense, is too narrow to be an adequate translation of <em>civitas</em>) the <a href="08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> consisting of His friends in this world and the next, whether men or <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, while the earthly kingdom is that of his enemies. These two kingdoms have existed since the fall of the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> but in a more limited sense and in relation to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is spoken of as <a href="08646a.htm">God's kingdom on earth</a> while the Roman Empire is all but identified with the <em>civitas terrena</em>; not altogether, however, because the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>, in securing peace for that part of the <a href="08646a.htm">heavenly kingdom</a> which is on its earthly <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, receives some kind of Divine sanction. We might, perhaps, have expected, now that the empire was <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, that <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> would have looked forward to a new <em>civitas terrena</em> reconciled and united to the <em>civitas Dei</em>; but this prophetic vision of the future was prevented, it may be, by the prevalent opinion, that the world was near its end. The <a href="../fathers/1201.htm">"De Civitate"</a>, however, which had a commanding influence in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, helped to form the ideal of Christendom by the development which it gave to the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> upon earth, its past history, its dignity, and universality.</p>

<p>From the fifth century till the days of <a href="03610c.htm">Charles the Great</a> there was no effectual political unity in the West, and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had no civil counterpart. But Charles' dominions extended from the Elbe to the Ebro and from Britany to Belgrade; there was but little of Western Christendom which they did not include. <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and the South of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> were the only parts of it which his power or his influence did not reach. Over the territories actually comprised in his empire he exercised a real control, administrative and legislative, as well as military. But the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> empire was far more than a mere political federation: it was a period of renewal and reorganisation in nearly every sphere of social life. It was spiritual, perhaps, even more than political. In <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> conversion went hand in hand with victory; in peace Charles ruled through <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> as effectively as through counts; his active solicitude extended to the reform and <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the promotion of learning, the revival of the <a href="02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a>, to the arts, to the liturgy and even the doctrines of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the West Christendom became a temporal polity and a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> as well as a Church, and the empire of Charles, brief though its existence proved to be, remained for many centuries an ideal and therefore a power. Yet the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> civilization was in most cases a return to late Roman models. Originality is not its characteristic. Charles' favourite church at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a> is supported on the columns which he sent for from the ruined <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Even in his relations with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> he would have found the closest precedents for his policy in the attitude of Constantine or even perhaps of Justinian. Great as was his respect for the <a href="12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>, he claimed for himself a masterful share in the administration of matters <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>: he could write, even before his <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> as emperor, to <a href="09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a>, "My part is to defend the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by force of arms from external attacks and to secure her internally through the establishment of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, your part is to render us the assistance of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>". Still every step forward has usually begun with a return to the past; it is thus that the artist or the statesman learns his craft. If the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> system had lasted, no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> much that was new would have been developed, and even under Charles's successor the spiritual and temporal powers were placed on a more equal and more appropriate footing. But Charles was too great for his age; his work was premature. The political bond was too weak to prevail over tribal loyalty and Teutonic particularism. Disorder and disruption would have broken up <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> civilization even if <a href="11115b.htm">Northman</a>, <a href="10424a.htm">Saracen</a>, and Hungarian had not come to plunge <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> once more into <a href="01452a.htm">anarchy</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>During the tenth century the work of moral and political reconstruction was slowly carried on by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="06058c.htm">feudalism</a>; in the eleventh came that struggle between these two creative factors of the new <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> which saved the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> from absorption into <a href="06058c.htm">feudalism</a>. This century opened with what was, perhaps, the most hopeful attempt, after Charles the Great, to give the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> empire a really universal character. The revived empire of <a href="11354a.htm">Otto I</a> in the middle of the tenth century had been but an imperfect copy of its <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> model. It was much more limited geographically, as it included only <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, its dependent states to the east, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; it was limited also in its interests, for Otto left to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> nearly all those spheres of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a>, literary, and artistic activity for which Charles had done so much. But Otto's grandson, the boy emperor <a href="11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, "magnum quoddam et improbabile cogitans", as a contemporary expressed it, attempted to make the empire less German, less military, more Roman, more universal, and more of a spiritual force. He was in intimate alliance with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and with almost startling originality he established in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the first German and then the first <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. He seems to have realized the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> that it was only by leaning on and developing religious aspect of the empire that he could hope at that stage of history to make its influence universal in the West. <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> was so unformed politically that the long reign of a wise and determined emperor backed up by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> might perhaps have changed its future history, have brought together into one broad and rather indefinite channel the small but already divergent streams of national tendencies, and built up <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> on the basis of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> federalism. But Otto <em>mirabile mundi</em>, died at the age of twenty-two, and the dream of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> empire faded away. Never again did a successor of his make a serious attempt to throw off his German character and to make the sphere of his rule conterminous with Christendom. Fascinating as is the theory of the Holy Roman Empire, and great as was its influence on history and speculation, it was always something of a sham. It claimed in political matters a sphere of action as wide as that of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> in things spiritual but, unlike the spiritual, this political plena potestas was never admitted. Even before the War of Investitures and the <a href="04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a> had made so wide a breach in the imperial prestige, an <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="04794b.htm">Dijon</a> of Italian origin could contrast the still enduring <a href="15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> with the disruption of the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>. The empire is generally held to have reached its zenith in the middle of the eleventh century but that is not the century in which we find the ideal of a united Christendom nearest its realization.</p>

<p>Political unity in the West was never restored after the fall of the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Empire, religious unity lasted till the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, but in the twelfth century we find, in addition, a very large measure of what may compendiously be called "social unity". Before that time isolation, disorder and the predominance of <a href="06058c.htm">feudalism</a> had kept men apart; after it the development of national distinctions was to have something of the same effect. The twelfth century is therefore the period in which <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> cosmopolitanism can best be studied. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was naturally the chief unifying force, in the darkest days she had preached the gospel to <a href="06238a.htm">Frank</a>, <a href="13497b.htm">Saxon</a>, and Gallo-Roman, and her organization had been, at critical moments when the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a> had almost sunk under the flood, the only bond which linked together the populations of the West. The opening century found the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the midst of that <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrandine</a> movement, in favour of <a href="03481a.htm">clerical celibacy</a> and against <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>, which was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to save the spiritual character of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> from being obliterated by too close a contact with temporal administration and the material <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> of <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. The reform, though its centre was at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was a <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> movement. Its forerunners had been found in the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and among the students of canon law in the Rhine cities; at the height of the struggle its leaders included <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a>, Lorrainers, <a href="06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, and a German monastic revival. When Paschal II showed signs of faltering, the movement was carried on almost in spite of him by the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of French reformers. Even <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and Demnark caught the saving infection, and the eventual settlement between Church and empire was foreshadowed in the concordat, devised probably by a <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> canonist, which was agreed to by <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> and Henry I. Thus did all the nations which were to be have their share in the victory of <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrandine</a> principles, and there was roused throughout the West a revival of the spiritual life. The ideals of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were raised, or rather they acquired strength and confidence to pursue ideals which they had always, though despairingly, acknowledged. This <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against selfishness, passion, and weakness brought together the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the West, as the attack on more material foes united its peoples, and as a consequence the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> body in the twelfth century is a real <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> almost contemptuous of political or racial frontiers. We find <a href="06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> and an Englishman in the chair of St. Peter; an Italian, <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, at <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; a <a href="13492a.htm">Savoyard</a>, <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>, at Lincoln; an <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> at <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>: instances such as those could be multiplied almost indefinitely. In <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> Latin this vast <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> possessed a language suited to the varied wants of the age, and it is as living as any vernacular if we read it in a letter of <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, a sermon of <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, a poem of <a href="01134b.htm">Adam of St. Victor</a>, the "Polycraticus" of <a href="08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, an assize of Henry II, the desultory chronicle of <a href="11278a.htm">Ordericus Vitalis</a> or the finished history of <a href="15639a.htm">William of Tyre</a>. It was a language which might have had a greater literature if the less simple amongst those who wrote had not been continually harking back to classical models.</p>

<p>The spirit of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was guarded and prompted by the ever increasing power of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. The days when the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had had to be rescued by the emperors from the petty and passionate Roman nobility must have seemed far off, and the most definite result of the War of Investitures was a second liberation, the conquest of the complete independence of papal elections. Never was the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> power in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> so great as in the years between the end of that <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> in 1122 and the great disaster of the <a href="04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a>. Besides being the guardian of the Faith, the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> was fast becoming the central court of Christendom. For close on two centuries, from <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> to <a href="09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> in the middle of the eleventh century, the plenary powers of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had been but exceptionally exercised north of the Alps though they had been acknowledged in principle, but in this most legal of centuries the exercise of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> becomes habitual. The curia was treated as a court of first instance as well as a court of appeal. Hardly any subject was too small or too local to be referred to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>: the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, for instance, decided whether or not the Duke of <a href="09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> might have a castle within four miles of Toul. Papal <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> might be met on all the highways of Christendom, <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> courts sat in every land. Canon law grew fast, and the "Decretum" of Gratian, about the middle of the century, though it was not an authoritative collection, provided <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> and judges with an admirable synthesis of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> pronouncements. St. Bernard was much troubled at the amount of legal business which poured in upon the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; it must, he considered, interfere with the more spiritual <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of his high office. But the movement was irresistible; the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> had become de facto the centre of a vast <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> nation. The empire was, as we have seen, out of court. It was in the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> that <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, a temporal as well as a spiritual <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, found its head in temporal and spiritual things alike.</p>

<p>After the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> the monastic orders have usually formed the strongest bond of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> union, and in the twelfth century the monastic spirit was full of life. In the previous epoch the <a href="04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> had played an essential part in the work of reconstruction; but life was now more complicated, and monasticism took many forms. The contemplative spirit of the old <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> inspired the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> foundation of <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, "the only ancient order which has never been reformed and never required reforming", the increased demand for <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> work led to the revival of regular canons, and in part to the foundation of the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a> produced the <a href="10304d.htm">military orders</a>, while in the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> the new spiritual fervour with its ascetical and mystical tendencies found appropriate expression. Seldom has a new order spread with such rapidity throughout <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> as these white <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and St. Bernard, their great representative is the most marvellous instance of the power of a single man, without official position, over all classes and different nations. The settlement of a disputed papal election practically depended on his verdict, he appeased the feuds of German noble <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> and reconciled Italian cities, he led one emperor to the South of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and sent another on a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> of the East; more wonderful still, single-handed he pursued the Roman people to forsake the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>. Though not the originator, he was the motive power of the <a href="04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a>, and his eloquence seemed as persuasive in the Rhine cities as in <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and as successful in saving the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> from the fanaticism of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> as in rousing the <a href="04543c.htm">crusading</a> spirit.</p>

<p>Besides the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and its many activities, there were other forces at work, other expressions of the energy of youthful Christendom which must at least be enumerated. The twelfth-century <a href="12765b.htm">renaissance</a> was a rapid development of what may be called Franco-Norman civilization. <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, if the name is given a comprehensive meaning, had conquered <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and South <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, had brought about the <a href="04543c.htm">crusades</a>, and had helped the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> to victory over the empire. It was in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> that the new monastic movements took their rise, and the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement as well. The <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> was the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> of Christendom, and the problems stated by the Breton <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a> excited the curiosity and the enthusiasm of young men from every country. French was spoken nearly as widely as Latin, and the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> epic, the romances of the Arthurian legend, and the lyrics of the troubadours, the three most characteristic forms of <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> vernacular literature all were developed amongst men who spoke one of the dialects of French. Politically the Franco-Norman world was divided between Plantagenet, Capetian, and the princes of the South, and the <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> of <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> gave a splendour to German politics, but intellectually and socially French civilization dominated <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It was however, a supremacy which lay in the rapidity and <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> thoroughness with which she expressed <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> common to the whole West. The development of <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> was almost parallel to the French, the epic and the Arthurian legend found a congenial soil in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and the lyrical poetry of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was almost a younger sister to that of Provence. The same spirit seemed to be abroad from <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a> to <a href="11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, and the <a href="09022a.htm">Christians of the West</a> must have felt that they were indeed citizens of a great city.</p>

<p>For this sense of a common Christendom was not confined to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> or the knightly and baronial classes. The peasantry and the town-population had much improved their <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> and legal positions since the beginning of the eleventh century, they had also profited by the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of action and experience. In the movement for the <a href="15068a.htm">Truce of God</a>, in the <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrandine</a> reform, in the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, in all these struggles of a crowded age, the holy people of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> had taken a prominent part; all had increased their self-confidence, all had drawn them closer to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to one another. Though the aim of the <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrandine</a> reform was to preserve the distinctive features of the <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> life, it had not formed the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> into a caste. <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> had appealed to the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, and the reformers found among the people allies most enthusiastic at times indeed fanatical and cruel. The <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, too, had <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the devotion of the poor <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> as well as knightly valour. At one moment, when the leaders had forgotten the Holy City for the sake of <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a> castles, it was the <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the poor that alone saved the fortunes of the expedition. On the other movements of the time <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people were often united, and municipal liberties, at least in their earlier stages, found a support in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, the greatest <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> of the century, was allied with the Lombard republics in their struggle with <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, the greatest of its emperors. It is at least probable that since the early ages of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> have never been so united as in this century. Few <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> have excited so much universal and popular enthusiasm as <a href="14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>, a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who thronged to Canterbury from all parts of Christendom are perhaps the best evidence of the union between people and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and between the different nations of the West.</p>

<p>The pontificate of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, which began before the close of the twelfth century, was the climax of this period of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> cosmopolitanism. It illustrates both the splendour of the ideal and the increasing difficulty of realizing it. Few <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> have had nobler aims than <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent</a>, few have been more favoured by nature and circumstance or have been apparently more successful. He was enabled to put at the head of a national movement in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, to govern <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where his predecessors had been weakest, to compel the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to respect the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of marriage and the King of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> those of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, to help in the success of two papalist candidates to the empire, and to see a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> sail for the East. These are but some of the successes of his reign, yet it is impossible to study the fortunes of his pontificate without observing that nearly every one of his victories is marked by the signs of ultimate failure. Of the two emperors whom he helped to the throne, the first repudiated all his engagements and declared open <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> upon him in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the second was that <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> who was to be the most thoroughgoing foe of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The homage which <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent</a> won from King John contributed in a later generation to embitter the relations between <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In his Italian policy, disinterested as it was, can be traced the first beginnings of future evils; the political power he had acquired led to the first case of nepotism and to the first appeal to a French noble for help in the South of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He lost control over both the religious campaigns which he set in motion, for he endeavoured unsuccessfully to protect Raymond of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> from the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> and to prevent the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> diverting the <a href="04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a> from <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to Constantinople.</p>

<p>That so great a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> should meet with failures so signal was significant of the change coming over <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The control over temporal and even <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters was slipping away from the head of Christendom, though the great <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent</a> and the successful <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> waged by his successors against the empire might disguise the fact from contemporaries. In the fourteenth century the national <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a>, the great Schism, the unimpeded progress of the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>, these were all witnesses to the divisions of Christendom. For a moment, at the time of the <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> in 1414, there seemed to be a rally; the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> appeared to be drawing together again in order to put an end to the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> and to reform the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; but as a matter of fact that council was the first of <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> congresses, a meeting of national delegates rather than a parliament of Christendom. The history of this change from the Christendom of the twelfth century to the nations of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> epoch, is the history of the later <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. It is possible, however, to disentangle some of the elements of this complicated process of disintegration.</p>

<p>To the modern student, who is wise after the event, it is clear by the eleventh century that the <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> of the future is not going to be built up politically as an empire and that the ultimate development of some form of national state is assured. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, though she might have preserved a large measure of social unity and linked the nations together, could never have formed a permanent, universal state, for <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is not, like <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a>, a political system. Politically, there seems but two alternatives; empire or nations. Indeed the roots of nationality can be traced deep down in geographical and racial differences and in the varying degrees in which the Teutonic invaders of the Roman Empire coalesced with its old inhabitants. In the twelfth century, though the sense of a common <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is the predominant characteristic of the age, the development of national distinctions proceeded apace. <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> was long to regret the glories of the reign of <a href="06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, yet even his power failed to level the Alps politically and to overcome the still hardly conscious nationalism of the Lombard cities. The social and <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> influence which <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> had exerted in the middle of the century began under <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> to take a political form; while in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> conquerors and conquered were fast amalgamating, and a national feeling, fostered by insular position, had grown up, though it was concealed for the moment by the extent of the Angevin Empire and the foreign interests of Henry II and <a href="13041b.htm">Richard I</a>. This empire broke into pieces under John, and, after an interval of weakness and hesitation, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> appears in the reign of Edward I as the country where nationality had most rapidly developed. Elsewhere, too, the process continued. The <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> of St. Louis gave to the French monarchy a halo comparable to the spiritual character which was to cling for so many centuries to the Holy Roman Empire. The fall of the Hohenstauffen decided finally what had long threatened, that <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> was to be not a State, but at any rate a nation severed from <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and that <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> itself was to live its own turbulent city life so fruitful in <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, in tyranny, in <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, and in works of art.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the new monarchies of the West became self-conscious through their lawyers. Secular law in the twelfth century had given its support to the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>, but it had been overshadowed, on the whole, by the great development of canon law. Towards the close of the thirteenth it had its revenge as the ally of the national sovereigns. Edward I was both one of the most legal and one of the most powerful of English kings, yet in his case legal absolutism was mitigated by customary law. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the enigmatic figure of <a href="12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> was half-concealed by his legist <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a>, men who combined a radical anti-clericalism, ready to go any lengths, with the most frank acknowledgment of the absolute power of the sovereign. It is an instance of the irony of history that Edward and Philip should be the contemporaries of <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, the boldest assertor of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy. The probable explanation is that the recent victory over the empire misled the papalist writers and perhaps the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> themselves. The disappearance of the Hohenstauffen seemed to leave the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> an undisputed supremacy in the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> world. It had been the practice to speak of the spiritual and temporal powers in terms of <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor, and it was long before it was realized, at least on the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> side, that the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a>, defeated as emperor, had returned to the attack with more aggressive vigour as the Monarchy and the State. The papal-imperial controversy continued, though with increasing unreality, when the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and the emperor was Louis of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and little effort was made to adapt to the new conditions the older theory of the co-ordinate powers of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, both of immediate Divine origin but differing in dignity.</p>

<p>The struggle between <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface</a> and Philip culminated in the outrage of <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, where <a href="11089a.htm">Nogaret</a>, the French lawyer, struck the aged <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. It was a brutal act, disgraceful only to the perpetrator. Unfortunately, it was followed by the migration, a few years later, of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> court to the prison-palace of <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. This premature development of French absolutism was followed by years of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and <a href="01452a.htm">anarchy</a>; but from her misfortunes <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> rose up a consolidated monarchy. In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, aristocratic misrule and some forty years of intermittent civil <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> produced the same result. In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and even in the German and Scandinavian principalities and kingdoms, different causes tended in the same direction. Thus grew up those monarchies, powerful at home jealous of foreign interference, which contributed so much to the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.</p>

<p>While in the political sphere nations were drawing apart, in the social sphere the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was losing much of her influence on the thoughts of men. Some of this loss was perhaps inevitable. New interests were springing up on every side with the growth of wealth, of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and of the complexity of life new professions, other than that of arms, were being opened to the <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>. Religion could hardly expect to keep the hold she had exercised on the outward lives of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Meanwhile the improvement of secular law would in time render unnecessary and invidious many of the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> privileges which had been so essential in a simpler age. Thus as <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> developed, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the most cosmopolitan element of it, would necessarily lose some of the commanding influence they had exercised in the ages when they represented civilization as well as religion. But other causes were at work. The high religious enthusiasm of the earlier twelfth century was not maintained at the same level either in <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> or people. And indeed even that <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> age had had its dark side. Passion, the fierce passionate character of a primitive people, was not yet subdued. What had been won by the <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrandine</a> movement had to be preserved. No moral victory is final: no generation can afford to disarm. The very success of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> brought its dangers, and increased power tended to <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> and worldliness. The faults and the wealth of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> must have contributed something, it would be difficult to say how much to the darkest feature of the age, the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> which even in St. Bernard's time lurked in secret nearly everywhere. This <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> spread like a plague through Southern <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and kept appearing sporadically north of the Alps. It seemed to threaten <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> alike. So acute did the danger become in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> that it almost justified the violences of the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> <a href="04543c.htm">Crusade</a> but the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the thirteenth century had nobler weapons than those of De Montfort or the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>: the Friars and <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> movement attacked <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, morally and intellectually, and routed it. Henceforth, however, till the sixteenth; century, no great religious or monastic movement, common to Christendom, was provoked by the many moral and <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> causes which led to the decline and fall of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> system and finally to the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> itself.</p>

<p>The history of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> cannot be separated from that of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The great <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> of the past had had a share which can hardly be over-estimated in binding together <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> and raising its moral level; it is not surprising that the diminished influence of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> is among the causes of the disintegration of Christendom. It is difficult not to trace the decadence to the struggle with <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. Before that struggle, in the days of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, the difficulties of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> were due to its agents, its subjects, to the very greatness of the task it had undertaken, not to the character or aims of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> themselves. But from <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> a different spirit seemed to prevail. The <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> were engaged in a hand-to-land conflict with a power which aimed at establishing a strong monarchy in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> which threatened to stifle Roman and <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> freedom the contest was not being waged with an imperious but distant German: it was Italian, territorial and bitter. The spiritual ruler seemed almost merged in the sovereign of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> lord of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Money was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and in order to obtain it funds had to be raised in other, and especially, transalpine lands, and by means which aroused much discontent and which affected the credit of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the central court of Christendom. The conception of canon law, of a system of courts <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a sacred <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over-riding political frontiers, is a magnificent one, and the <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> which <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> law owes to the canonists is admitted by the modern masters of legal history. It was a system, however, which had many rivals, and it required the support of a high moral prestige. Unfortunately, the machinery was, from the first, defective, there was no organization at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> capable of dealing with the press of legal business, and even in the twelfth century complaints of venality and delay were frequent and bitter. Litigants are not easily satisfied, nor has the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> often been at once impartial cheap, and speedy in any country yet it can hardly be denied that in the thirteenth century; the Roman courts suffered from very serious abuses.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to follow the fortunes of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> after the thirteenth century; the lesson of the French influence, of the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, of the Italianization of the fifteenth-century <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, is but too clear. Though the essential <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were but seldom denied in those years, it was clear, when the crisis came, and when the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy had to bear the first attack, that that devotion which makes <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and the enthusiasm which inspires righteous rebellion were sadly lacking. It would seem, then that the growth of national divisions, the increased secularism of everyday life, the diminished influence of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, that all these interdependent influences had broken up the social unity of Christendom at least two centuries before the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, yet it must never be forgotten that religious unity remained. As long as Christendom was <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> it was a reality, a visible <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> with one head and one <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Though for the moment centrifugal tendencies were in the ascendant, the future was full of possibilities. A great religious movement, a revival of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit, the reform which should have come when the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> came, any such appeal to the common <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> loyalty might have brought the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> nations together again, have put some check upon their internal absolutism and external combativeness and have removed from the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> name the reproach of mutual antagonism.</p>

<p>Such speculation is, however, as idle as it is fascinating, instead of the reform, of the renewal of the spiritual life of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> round the old principles of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and unity, there came the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was broken up beyond the hope of at least proximate reunion. But it was long before this fact was realized even by the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> and indeed it must have been more difficult for a subject of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> to convince himself that the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> was really being torn asunder than for us to conceive the full meaning and all the consequences of a united Christendom. Much of the weakness of ordinary men in the earlier years of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, much of their attitude towards the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>, can be explained by their blindness to what was happening. They thought, no doubt, that all would come right in the end. So dangerous is it, particularly in times of revolution, to trust to anything but principle.</p>

<p>The effect of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was to separate from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> all the Scandinavian, most of the Teutonic, and a few of the Latin-speaking populations of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> but the spirit of division once established worked further mischief, and the antagonism between <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> was almost as bitter as that between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. At the beginning, however, of the seventeenth century, Christendom was weary of religious <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and for a moment it almost seemed as if the breach were to be closed. The deaths of Philip II and Elizabeth, the conversion and the tolerant policy of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the accession of the House of Stuart to the English throne, the pacification between and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, all these events pointed to the same direction. A like tendency is apparent in the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> speculation of the time: the learning and judgment of Hooker, the first beginning of the High Church movement, the spread of <a href="01740c.htm">Arminianism</a> in <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, these were all signs that in the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant Churches</a>, thought, study, and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> had begun to moderate the fires of controversy, while in the monumental works of Francisco Su&aacute;rez and the other Spanish <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> seems to be resuming that stately, comprehensive view of its problems which is so impressive in the great <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. It is not surprising that this moment, when the cause of reconciliation seemed in the ascendant, was marked by a scheme of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> political union. Much importance was at one time attributed to the <em>grand dessein</em> of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>. Recent historians are inclined to assign most of the design to Henry's <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister, Sully, the king's share in the plan was probably but small. A coalition <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> was first to secure <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> against the domination of the Hapsburgs but an era of peace was to follow. The different <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> States, whether <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> were to preserve their independence, to practise toleration, to be united in a "Christian Republic" under the presidency of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and to find an outlet for their energies in the recovery of the East. These dreams of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> reunion soon melted away. Religious divisions were too deep-seated to permit the reconstruction of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> polity, and the cure for international ills has been sought in other directions. The <a href="09073a.htm">international law</a> of the seventeenth century jurists was based upon national law, not upon <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> fellowship, the balance of power of the eighteenth century on the elementary <a href="08050b.htm">instinct</a> of self-defence, and the nationalism of the nineteenth on racial or linguistic distinctions. It has never occurred to anyone to take seriously the mystic terminology with which in the Holy Alliance Alexander I of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> clothed his policy of conservative intervention. The Greek insurrection and the Eastern questions generally restored the word <em>Christian</em> to the vocabulary of the <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="04798c.htm">chanceries</a>, but it has come in recent times to express our common civilization rather than a religion which so many <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a> now no longer possess.
