<p>The name of a German firm of publishers and booksellers.</p>

<h2>Bartholom&auml;us Herder</h2>

<p>Founder of the present publishing firm, b. at the Swabian free- town of Rottweil on the Neckar, 22 August, 1774; d. at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> im Breisgau, 11 March, 1839. Originally destined for <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, he was elaborating, while yet a student at the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Blasien and at the <a href="04795a.htm">University of Dillingen</a>, his plan of "gaining his livelihood by the dissemination of good books" as a "scholarly publisher". In 1801, during the turbulent period prior to the dissolution of the old <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, he began his career, at the instance of the Prince-Bishop (soon afterwards Prince Primate) Karl Theodore von Dalberg, in the capacity of "publisher to the princely episcopal court of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>", at Meersburg on the Lake of Constance, the episcopal residence and seat of a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Among his first publications, which were mainly of a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and pedagogic character, we find <a href="15590b.htm">Wessenberg's</a> "Archiv f&uuml;r pastorale Conferenzen in den Landkapiteln des Bisthums Constanz" (1802-27). In 1810 Bartholom&#228;us transferred his business to Freiburg im Breisgau, where, in close connexion with the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, he gave a more comprehensive character to his publications and developed his miscellaneous stock in new directions. One of his most important publications was Karl von Rotteck's "Allgemeine Geschichte vom Anfang der historischen Kenntniss bis auf unsere Zeiten" (9 vols., 1812-27; the 15th edition being issued by another firm), which for more than a generation was "the gospel of the <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> liberal middle classes". Being entrusted with the publication of the official <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> bulletin, the "Teutsche Bl&#228;tter", by the royal and imperial authorities at head- quarters as early as the end of 1813, Herder went to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> with the allied armies in 1815 in <a href="10245a.htm">Metternich's</a> train as "Director of the Royal and Imperial Field Press". Subsequent to the conclusion of peace he founded an art institution for lithography, copperplate engraving, and modelling in terra cotta, in connexion with his publishing business. In the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> upwards of three hundred pupils were turned out from this institution, while the sumptuous illustrations and maps that were issued mark an epoch in the history of this branch of technic&mdash;especially the "Heilige Schriften des Alten und Neuen Testamentes in 200 biblischen Kupfern" (the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a> of the Old and the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in 200 biblical engravings), of which he reproduced numerous impressions by an original lithographic process, and Woerl's "Atlas von Central-Europa in 60 Bl&#228;ttern" (Atlas of Central <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 60 plates, 1830), which was the earliest employment of two-colour lithography. As late as 1870 this atlas rendered important service to the German army by reason of the map of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> it contained. Although such great achievements won a <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> reputation for the house, the commercial profits derived therefrom were entirely disproportionate to the expenditure. Consequently the condition of the house at Bartholom&#228;us Herder's death in 1839 was by no means a satisfactory one. His two sons succeeded to the heritage.</p>

<h2>Karl Raphael Herder</h2>

<p>(Born 2 November, 1816; died 10 June, 1865), the older son of Bartholom&#228;us, took up the commercial side of the business, while the younger B<font size=-2>ENJAMIN</font> H<font size=-2>ERDER</font> (b. 31 July, 1818; d. 10 November, 1888), took charge of the publishing department until his brother's retirement in 1856, when he undertook the sole management. Equipped with a thorough, scholarly <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, trained in the book business by his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> and under Gauthier de Laguionie in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Benjamin had had his views further broadened early in life by travels through <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Of a character earnest and religious, he was strongly impressed by the Cologne troubles of 1837, and, as in the case of so many of his contemporaries, they gave a direction to his life, and this youth of twenty-one set to work with the definite aim of taking his part in the liberation and revival of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. First of all he gradually abandoned fine-art publications in favour of book-publishing, being thus enabled to devote the full measure of his energies to the service of religious learning. Herein he displayed such activity in the encouragement of particular branches of erudition that the history of his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> publications, for instance, would comprise a considerable fragment of the history of modern <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> literature, and the <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> branch thereof would constitute one of the most important divisions of the history of catechetics. After <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> Herder applied himself with the greatest zest to pedagogies, to the lives and learning of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> as well as to other edifying biographies; also after a long and cautious delay to the publication of sermons. He next took up works dealing with the religious and political problems of the day, with questions of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy and social controversies and issues. Finally, passing beyond the limits which previously <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature had seldom ventured to transcend, he began the publication of works on the general <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>&mdash;history and philosophy, the natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, geography, and ethnology, including the publication of atlases, <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> textbooks, music, art and its literature, the history of literature, and belles-lettres. His governing purpose throughout was to avoid wasting his energies on particular publications, but to build up the various branches gradually and systematically by the publication of more comprehensive "collections" and "libraries" and by the issue of scientific periodicals.</p>

<p>The "Kirchenlexikon" (Church Lexicon) was the great centre of his fifty years' activity as a publisher. It was the first comprehensive attempt to treat everything that had any connexion with <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> encyclopedically in one work, and also the first attempt to unite all the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> savants of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who had hitherto pursued each his own path, in the production of one great work. Herder had nursed this project since 1840. The difficulties encountered even in the preliminary work were almost inconceivable. Then, when its appearance was made possible and its issue was begun in 1847 under the direction of <a href="15587a.htm">Welte</a>, the <a href="05692b.htm">exegete</a> of T&uuml;bingen, and <a href="15607b.htm">Wetzer</a>, the <a href="11302c.htm">Orientalist</a> of <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, followed the even graver difficulties of ensuring its continuation, difficulties which were heightened at the beginning by the terrors of the Revolution of 1848, and towards the end by the oppression of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="02194a.htm">Baden</a>. But finally, after sixteen years of struggling and striving on the part of Herder, all obstacles were overcome, and the work was brought to completion in 1856, thanks chiefly to the never-failing, self-sacrificing support of Hefele. It had a decisive influence on the subsequent <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and the importance which the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scientific world attributed to it was eloquently demonstrated in the fact that, while it was still in process of issue, the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> scholars made use of Herder's scheme, even down to the smallest details, for the "Real-Encyklop&#228;die f&uuml;r protestantische Theologie". It was sixteen years more before the preliminary work could be begun on the new edition which soon became <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and ten years more before its publication could be started. While the historical element had been especially emphasized in the first edition, the dogmatic and <a href="05692b.htm">exegetical</a> side was expanded to equal dimensions in the second edition, in view of the far-reaching change which had taken place in the domain of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The subjects to be treated were chosen by Adalbert Weiss, professor at the Freising lyceum, and the editorial chair was held by <a href="07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> until his elevation to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, and afterwards by <a href="08611a.htm">Kaulen</a>, the <a href="05692b.htm">exegete</a> of Bonn.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The stupendous plan, which Benjamin had cherished since 1841, of building up a "Theologische Bibliothek" (Theological Library) according to an equally <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> and symmetrical scheme, he was unable to realize until thirty years later. When the "Kirchenlexikon" was nearing completion, Herder sought, by the publication of the "Konversations-Lexikon" (Universal Encyclopedia, 1st ed., 1853-7), to make the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> public independent of the hostile literature which ruled unchallenged in the highly important domain of works of general information. Although, out of regard for the limited purchasing capacity of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> public in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he confined himself to the modest limits of five medium-sized volumes, still the undertaking was for his day a very <a href="06147a.htm">courageous</a> one. Of the very great number of other works published by him, we can draw attention only to the most notable, which spread the reputation of the house far beyond the limits of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Among the earliest were the works of <a href="14302a.htm">Alban Stolz</a>, a man endowed by nature with all the gifts of the popular <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> and teacher of the people, whose "Kalender f&uuml;r Zeit und Ewigkeit", assailing in powerful and eloquent language the fundamental evils of the world and the age, achieved an extraordinary success in strengthening and deepening the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the people. Alongside of <a href="14302a.htm">Stolz</a> we find Ignaz Schuster, whose catechisms and Biblical histories, issued in constantly improved editions and based upon the tradition of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the text of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a>, were scattered over the world, like <a href="14302a.htm">Stolz's</a> works, in hundreds of thousands of copies, the larger editions of the Biblical histories being translated into no less than twenty-five languages. Even before the completion of the "Kirchenlexikon" Hefele began his monumental "Conciliengeschichte". The strong religious revival that set in with the sixties was heralded by <a href="07307a.htm">Hettinger's</a> pioneer work, the "Apologie des Christentums", which set forth the religious teachings of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to the cultured world in well-timed fashion, and which, reprinted again and again, and constantly improved, continues to exercise a potent influence in five foreign civilized languages even to this day. The "Apologien" of Weiss and Schanz were subsequently issued to support and supplement <a href="07307a.htm">Hettinger's</a> "Apologie". Of these works the one contrasts <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life and its historical and cultural development with a purely worldly <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the outlook of the age, while the other strives to harmonize the doctrines of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the results of scientific research.</p>

<p>The Encyclicals of December, 1864, and the question of <a href="07790a.htm">infallibility</a> called forth in the pages of the "Stimmen aus Maria Laach" the comprehensive defence of the authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, as <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and teacher, while the controversies concerning the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> occasioned <a href="07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther's</a> masterly "Anti-Janus", afterwards expanded and strengthened in the almost inexhaustible hisorico-theological essays, the "Katholische Kirche und christlicher Staat in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung und in Beziehung auf Fragen der Gegenwart". The "Stimmen", which at first appeared irregularly, inaugurated those relations between the house of Herder and the German <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> which have <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> of so great importance to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> learning and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life, and have kept the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in such close touch with their native country even while they were in exile during the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>. Of the abundant fruits of these relations we may mention the great "Collectio Lacensis" of the more recent councils, which displays a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> industry in the collection of materials, and the "Philosophia Lacensis", nor can we forget the vigorous "Stimmen", which rapidly developed into the organ of the current <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> movement, and its thoroughly stimulating and very instructive "Erg&#228;nzungshefte" (Supplementary Numbers), which already number more than one hundred. After the <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the fundamental decrees of the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, the "Theologische Bibliothek" was opened under brilliant auspices with <a href="13525b.htm">Scheeben's</a> profound "Handbuch der Dogmatik". While the <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> was threatening to silence every expression of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life, <a href="08284c.htm">Janssen's</a> epoch-making "Geschichte des deutschen Volkes" began its triumphant course, and carried, for the first time, Cathlic research into wide <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> circles. The last ten years of Herder's existence <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> his life-work. Quite apart from the individual volumes of the various Collections and of the Apologies already mentioned, he produced, among other works, the "Real-Encyklop&#228;die der christlichen Alterth&uuml;mer" by F. X. Kraus, the new edition of the "Kirchenlexikon", Knecht's "Praktischer Kommentar zur biblischen Geschichte", the "Bibliothek f&uuml;r L&#228;nder- und V&ouml;lker-kunde", the "Jahrbuch der Naturwissenschaften", Pastor's "Geschichte der P&#228;pste", the "Staatslexikon der G&ouml;rres-Gesellschaft", the "Archiv f&uuml;r Literature und Kirchengeschichte des Mittelalters" by <a href="04719a.htm">Denifle</a> and Ehrle, and the "Bibliothek f&uuml;r katholische P&#228;dagogik".</p>

<p>Thus Benjamin Herder's activity as a publisher was always a faithful mirror of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the nineteenth century, and furthermore a powerful lever exerted in favour of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. This was so much the more creditable, since Herder was not merely the agent, but also in general the originator of his enterprises. Possessing a clear and profound <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the needs of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature, it was usually he who selected the themes for literary treatment. When he once recognized a project to be right, he clung to it tenaciously until conditions <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> favourable, although decades elapsed before his scheme could be realized. Almost always on the watch for competent collaborators, he discovered the majority by his own exertions, personal acquaintance usually developing into lifelong friendship. In no undertaking did he allow material gain to be the deciding factor; even in times of crisis&mdash;and of such he encountered more than one, beginning with the Baden uprising of 1848, right through the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> which raged between 1859 and 1871, down to the dreary years of the <em><a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> which crippled the resources of both <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people&mdash;the end in view alone determined his decision. Thoroughly alive to his grave responsibility as a publisher, he devoted extraordinary care to the training of capable and conscientious assistants. His partner, Franz Joseph Hutter (b. at Ravensburg, 25 November, 1840) issued from the ranks of these "pupils". His essentially practical nature happily complemented Benjamin's <a href="07634a.htm">idealism</a>, which even repeated warnings had not been able to shake. New branches were established to open a wider market than the older establishments at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> and Strasburg afforded. In 1873 were founded the St. Louis (U. S. A.) branch, under the management of Joseph Gummersbach, and the <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> branch under Herder's brother-in-law, Adolf Streber, and in 1886 that at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, while enterprises of even greater promise were contemplated. In 1863 Herder married Emilie Streber, the accomplished daughter of <a href="14315c.htm">Franz Streber</a>, professor at the <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> University, and celebrated as a <a href="11152a.htm">numismatist</a>. His alliance with the Streber <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> introduced Herder to that very circle of men who played the most important part in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. It was also contemporaneous with a more active movement in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, in which Herder took a notable part. Though handicapped throughout by great physical sufferings, he bore all to the end without complaining, striving unceasingly onwards and upwards.</p>

<p>Under the new management, conducted by H<font size=-2>ERMANN</font> H<font size=-2>ERDER</font>, a series of collections, chiefly <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and historical, have been issued, and also a steadily increasing number of publications in foreign languages, principally Spanish and English, while in recent years various annuals have been published. We may here mention the monumental undertakings, the "Geschichte der Weltliteratur" of Baumgartner, the definitive collection of sources for the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine Council</a>, the third, completely revised, edition of the "Konversations-Lexikon", which now ranks with the great Leipzig encyclopedias, and Wilpert's superb work on the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. In 1906 a branch of the firm was established at <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>.</p>
