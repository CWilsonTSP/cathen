<p>(Also called the <em>Assumptionists</em>.)</p>

<p>This congregation had its origin in the College of the Assumption, established in N&icirc;mes <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1843, by the Rev. Emmanuel d'Alzon <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of that <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, some account of whose life and work is given at the end of this article. Although it was organized in 1847, the members did not take their first <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> until 1850; they took their public <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> at <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a> of the next year. A second house was established in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and they continued their work there, encouraged by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The congregation was formally approved by a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 26 November, 1864. The chief objects of the congregation are to combat the spirit of irreligion in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and the spread of <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> in the East. To this end the Assumptionists have devoted themselves to the work of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> higher and secondary <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, to the spread of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> by means of the Press, to the conduct of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, and to missionary work in the East. In addition to their college at <a href="11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a> they established Apostolic schools where poor students were <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> without expense to themselves. They established "La Bonne Presse" which issued periodicals, pamphlets, and books in great numbers the chief publication, "La Croix" appearing simultaneously in several different cities. Their activities provoked the resentment of the French Government, and in 1900 the congregation was suppressed within French territory, this action being based on the charge that they were accumulating a fund to be used in a royalist movement to overthrow the Republic. Many of the Assumptionists left <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> after this, but some remained as <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> under the authority of various <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>At the time of their suppression the Assumptionists maintained twenty Apostolic schools which in twenty-five years gave more than 500 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. These <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> have all been closed, but the congregation has taken up the work in other quarters. Similar <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> have been established in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. "La Bonne Presse" was purchased at the time of the suppression by Paul Feron-Vrau, a wealthy manufacturer of Lisle, and all its publications have been continued without any change of policy. Much of the good accomplished by the Assumptionists was effected through this medium. They entered into competition with the irreligious press in <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> circules, in workshops, and places where workmen congregate, with excellent results. Until recently no popular <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper has reached a degree of circulation equal to that of "La Croix" or of "Le P&egrave;lerin". These two papers are issued at the rate of three million per week, Saturdays this is increased to four million copies. To this must be added the circulation of 600,000 copies of "The Lives of the Saint", 70,000 of the "Les contemporains" besides the many copies of the "Revue scientifique"; "Cosmos"; "Questions actuelles"; "Les Echos de l'Orient"; the "Petit Bleu", and many others. In <a href="03660a.htm">Chile</a>, where these Fathers have been for thirteen years, they publish in Spanish "Echoes from the Sanctuary of Lourdes". In their journalistic work they were aided by the Oblate <a href="02006a.htm">Sisters of the Assumption</a>, an order established by them to assist in their Oriental missions, but whose activities are not contained to that field. Until the suppression they directed the <a href="15687b.htm">women's</a> section in the publishing rooms of the "Christian Press" as well as the <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</p>

<p>Among other works carried on by the Assumptionists in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> prior to their suppression was that of the "Association of Our Lady of Salvation", a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> devoted to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, and setting a good example for the reformation of the <a href="08719a.htm">working</a> class. This <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was established in eighty <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and it succeeded in drawing the higher classes of <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> more closely to the workingmen. It encouraged everywhere social <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and social and national expiation, and discouraged human respect, social apostasy, and isolation in <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. It raised funds to convey workmen, <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, paupers, and sick poor to Lourdes to the number of a thousand each year; it was <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the cause of workmen's clubs, and of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Schools, and was active in the movement in favour of the keeping of Sunday as a day of rest. Another field of missionary labour was found among the Newfoundland fishermen. Every year 12,000 or 15,000 fishermen leave the coasts of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, to go to the Banks of Newfoundland for codfish. The Prostestants have long maintained a flotilla of <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> ships, with which they go to the aid of these unfortunate men and, while ministering to their material needs, draw their <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> to <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The Assumptionists found here a field for their activity and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. They have organized the most prominent catholic sailors into a committee and have been encouraged to equip two catholic <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> ships, which now succour the unfortunate fishermen. The vessels have already been wrecked twice, but have been replaced, and the Assumptionists have continued their labours.</p>

<p>The Assumptionists have been active missionaries in the Orient, where at the present time 300 of the congregation, Fathers and Brothers, and nearly 400 Sisters are engaged. Their labours take them from the Balkans to the Dead Sea. They have established there twenty-two permanent residences thirty regular missionary stations, and fifteen institutions entrusted to the Oblates of the Assumption. In the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in Turkey in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and Turkey in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> the Assumptionists have 2,500 scholars. Here the Oblates have opened a <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> an <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, and nine gratuitous dispensaries, where they care for about 30,000 sick every year. Of the twenty-two public churches of the congregation in the East twelve are <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and in four of them the Offices are held in the rites of the Orient (Greek, or <a href="14042a.htm">Slav</a>). These rites the Assumptionists have embraced to render the teaching of the Gospel more fruitful. The Orientals, whether from <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of their legitimate traditions, or from <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, make of the exterior form of the rites a question of supreme importance. Called in 1862 to work for the conversion of the <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, the Assumptionists have founded in the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> quarter of <a href="01161a.htm">Adrianople</a>, and in Karagatch the <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> quarter, a residence with a <a href="14042a.htm">Slav</a> church and a Latin church a <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a>, three <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and a <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the Greek and <a href="14042a.htm">Slav</a> Rites, in which forty young men receive their maintenance and are prepared for the office of the sacred ministry. A similar work is being done at Philippopoli, the cradle of the Oriental missions of the Assumptionists. There is also a primary <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, attended by 200 scholars, and an <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> institute, many of the former pupils of which occupy important official positions in Eastern Rumelia. The Assumptionists have also churches and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of different rites at Yamboli and Varna.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>At the instance of Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli when he was <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>, the Assumptionists went to Constantinople and established themselves in the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> quarter at Koum-Kapou. The animosity of the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the jealousy of the Greeks and <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> caused the new missionaries to be very badly received. To escape <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> they worked on their building at night, doing their masonry, carpentry and <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a> themselves. By this stratagem they constructed their church of Anastasia, the first church <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship in this quarter since 1453. This church, to favour the conversion of the schismatics, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> and dedicated by the <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> himself. The congregation possess other Greek churches at Kadikoi (Chalcedon) on the <a href="01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> bank of the Bosporus, and at Gallipoii. In order to prepare a native <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the Assumptionists have opened at Stamboul (Constantinople) a <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em>, where sixty young men are instructed in the <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>. At Kadikoi in the great Leonine <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, they follow with the ordinary <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course special lessons in preparation for the pastoral ministry. They are also given instructions in liturgy, history, canon law and in the Greek, <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a>, and <a href="14042a.htm">Slav</a> languages. At the day of its opening this <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> had thirty scholars and eight professors. At Stamboul, as at kadikoi, there are flourishing <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and girls, with more than 700 scholars in attendance. They do not suffice for receiving all the scholars who present themselves. To the labours of teaching are united those of the apostleship, in behalf of the natives as well as foreigners. At Stamboul and at Kadikoi the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> preach and hear <a href="11618c.htm">confessions</a> in Italian, French, German, Greek, and <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a>. In the various houses established throughout the empire at least ten living languages are spoken. Greeks, Latins, and Orientals unite for the conferences of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and the Sisters visit and ensure for the sick to the number of 10,000 annually.</p>

<p>Their <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Oriental languages has been of great service to the Assumptionist Fathers in their journalistic labours. Twelve of the Fathers who are the most skilled in these studies write in the Oriental Review. They have their special bulletin, "Les Echos de l'Orient", which circulates among Greeks and Orientals. Because of the Oriental <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of splendour in external worship the feasts of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> are celebrated with great pomp. With the consent of the authorities, and under the protection of a corps of soldiers the processions of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> are conducted through all the streets around Santa Sophia. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> funerals solemnized with reverential pomp produce also a great effect upon the impressionable natives. In 1890 the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a> confided to the Assumptionists the territory in <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> extending from Broussa to Angora. It practically embraces the ancient Bithynia. Already six residences have been established there; in the city of Broussa of 100,000, they have established a large and two churches, one of which is the Latin <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>. The towns of Eski-Chehir Ismid, Sultan Eschoir, Koniah (Iconium), Fanaraki have each a residence for the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> with a public church; the Oblate Sisters are also established in these places. At <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the Assumptionists have erected the Hostelry of Our Lady of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> for the reception of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> annexed to which is a scholasticate of forty religious. They have established there also the Society of the Croises of Purgatory and they have a church in which to receive the Latin <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The Eucharitic Congress at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1893 was held in the Hostelry of our Lady of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<p>Emmanuel-Joseph-Marie-Maurice d'Alzon, founder and first Superior General of the Augustinians of the Assumption was born 30 August, 1810, and died at <a href="11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, 21 November, 1880. He was a member of a noble <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, and, being an only son, encountered strong opposition when he decided to enter the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> state. He studied at the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> and later at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> 26 December 1834. On his return to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the next year he was appointed <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="11083a.htm">Diocese of N&icirc;mes</a>, which position he held for forty-five years, serving under four <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Among his earliest notable works was the establishment at <a href="11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a> in 1843 of the children of the aristocracy. This college later became the cradle of his congregation. He was associated with <a href="07058a.htm">Gu&eacute;ranger</a>, <a href="15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a>, and other champions of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. With the "Revue de l'enseignement chr&eacute;tien", which he founded and directed, he restored the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit in classical studies. To combat <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in Southern <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> he established the Association of St. Francis de Sales. He also suggested the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> caravan, formed by the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> at <a href="11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, who by request of Mgr. Plantier came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to visit the <a href="12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>. This was the beginning of the great <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> called the national <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, the directors of which were for many years the religious of the order founded by P&egrave;re d'Alzon. By his "alumnats", or Apostolic schools, he supplied the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the poor children called to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, who, owing to lack of means, could not be admitted to the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. The Fathers of the Assumption opened fifteen of these houses which in twenty-five years gave more than 500 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. To sustain this work of charity, P&egrave;re d'Alzon founded the Association of Our Lady of Vocations, enriched with numerous <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. The brotherhood, by a degree of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was been canonically established in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the College of <a href="11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, and has received the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of many <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. P&egrave;re d'Alzon was much esteemed by the Popes <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> and <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. The latter in 1863 sent him to Constantinople to found in the East the missions of the Congregation of the Assumption. More than once he was proposed for the episcopate, but he always declined the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, preferring to devote himself to the work of his congregation.</p>
