<h2>Origin of the word</h2>

<p>The Teutonic word <em>Lent</em>, which we employ to denote the forty days' <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> preceding <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, originally meant no more than the spring season. Still it has been used from the <a href="01505a.htm">Anglo-Saxon</a> period to translate the more significant <a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> term <a href="12589a.htm"><em>quadragesima</em></a> (French <em>car&#234;me,</em> <a href="08245a.htm">Italian</a> <em>quaresima</em>, Spanish <em>cuaresma</em>), meaning the "forty days", or more literally the "fortieth day". This in turn imitated the Greek name for Lent, <em>tessarakoste</em> (fortieth), a word formed on the analogy of <a href="11661a.htm">Pentecost</a> (<em>pentekoste</em>), which last was in use for the <a href="08399a.htm">Jewish</a> festival before <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> times. This etymology, as we shall see, is of some little importance in explaining the early developments of the <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a>.</p>

<h2>Origin of the custom</h2>

<p>Some of the <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> as early as the fifth century supported the view that this forty days' <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> was of <a href="01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> institution. For example, <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo</a> (d. 461) exhorts his hearers to <a href="01067a.htm">abstain</a> that they may "fulfill with their <a href="05789c.htm">fasts</a> the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> institution of the forty days" &mdash; ut apostolica institutio quadraginta dierum jejuniis impleatur (P.L., LIV, 633), and the historian <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (d. 433) and <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (d. 420) use similar language (P.G., LXVII, 633; P.L., XXII, 475).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But the best modern scholars are almost unanimous in rejecting this view, for in the existing remains of the first three centuries we find both considerable diversity of practice regarding the <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> before <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> and also a gradual process of development in the matter of its duration. The passage of primary importance is one quoted by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.24</a>) from a letter of <a href="08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</a> to <a href="15408a.htm">Pope Victor</a> in connection with the <a href="05228a.htm">Easter controversy</a>. There <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> says that there is not only a controversy about the time of keeping <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> but also regarding the preliminary <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a>. "For", he continues, "some think they ought to <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> for one day, others for two days, and others even for several, while others reckon forty hours both of day and night to their <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a>". He also urges that this variety of usage is of ancient date, which implies that there could have been no <a href="15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a> on the subject. <a href="13221b.htm">Rufinus</a>, who translated <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> into <a href="09023a.htm">Latin</a> towards the close of the fourth century, seems so to have punctuated this passage as to make <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> say that some people <a href="05789c.htm">fasted</a> for forty days. Formerly some difference of opinion existed as to the proper reading, but modern criticism (e.g., in the edition of Schwartz commissioned by the Berlin Academy) pronounces strongly in favor of the text translated above. We may then fairly conclude that <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> about the year 190 knew nothing of any <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> of forty days.</p>

<p>The same inference must be drawn from the language of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> only a few years later. When writing as a <a href="10521a.htm">Montanist</a>, he contrasts the very slender term of <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> observed by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (i.e., "the days on which the <a href="08374c.htm">bridegroom</a> was taken away", probably meaning the <a href="06643a.htm">Friday</a> and <a href="07424a.htm">Saturday</a> of <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>) with the longer but still restricted period of a fortnight which was kept by the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a>. No doubt he was referring to <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> of a very strict kind (<em>xerophagi&aelig;</em> &mdash; dry <a href="05789c.htm">fasts</a>), but there is no indication in his works, though he wrote an entire treatise <a href="../fathers/0408.htm">"De Jejunio"</a>, and often touches upon the subject elsewhere, that he was acquainted with any period of forty days <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to more or less continuous <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> (see <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0408.htm"><em>On Fasting</em> 2</a> and <a href="../fathers/0408.htm">14</a>; cf. <a href="../fathers/0322.htm"><em>On Prayer</em> 18</a>; etc.).</p>

<p>And there is the same silence observable in all the pre-Nicene <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, though many had occasion to mention such an <a href="01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> institution if it had existed. We may note for example that there is no mention of Lent in <a href="05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a> (ed. Feltoe, 94 sqq.) or in the <a href="04781b.htm">"Didascalia"</a>, which <a href="06322c.htm">Funk</a> attributes to about the year 250; yet both speak diffusely of the <a href="11516a.htm">paschal</a> <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a>.</p>

<p>Further, there seems much to suggest that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age designed to commemorate the <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>, not by an annual, but by a weekly celebration (see "The Month", April 1910, 337 sqq.). If this be so, the <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> <a href="09790b.htm">liturgy</a> constituted the weekly memorial of the <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and the Friday <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> that of the <a href="11527b.htm">Death of Christ</a>. Such a theory offers a natural explanation of the wide divergence which we find existing in the latter part of the second century regarding both the proper time for keeping <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and also the manner of the <a href="11516a.htm">paschal</a> <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a>. <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were at one regarding the weekly observance of the <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> and the Friday, which was primitive, but the annual <a href="05224d.htm">Easter festival</a> was something superimposed by a process of natural development, and it was largely influenced by the conditions locally existing in the different <a href="03744a.htm">Churches</a> of the <a href="05230a.htm">East</a> and <a href="09022a.htm">West</a>. Moreover, with the <a href="05224d.htm">Easter festival</a> there seems also to have established itself a preliminary <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a>, not as yet anywhere exceeding a week in duration, but very severe in character, which <a href="11526a.htm">commemorated the Passion</a>, or more generally, "the days on which the <a href="08374c.htm">bridegroom</a> was taken away".</p>

<p>Be this as it may, we find in the early years of the fourth century the first mention of the term <em>tessarakoste</em>. It occurs in the fifth <a href="03287a.htm">canon</a> of the <a href="11044a.htm">Council of Nicea</a> (A.D. 325), where there is only question of the proper time for celebrating a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a>, and it is conceivable that it may refer not to a period but to a definite <a href="06021b.htm">festival</a>, e.g., the <a href="01767b.htm">Feast of the Ascension</a>, or the <a href="03245b.htm">Purification</a>, which &AElig;theria calls <em>quadragesim&aelig; de <a href="05503a.htm">Epiphania</a></em>. But we have to remember that the older word, <em>pentekoste</em> (<a href="15614b.htm">Pentecost</a>) from meaning the fiftieth day, had come to denote the whole of the period (which we should call <a href="11516a.htm">Paschal Time</a>) between <a href="05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> and <a href="15614b.htm">Whit-Sunday</a> (cf. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0302.htm"><em>On Idolatry</em> 14</a>, &mdash; "pentecosten implere non poterunt"). In any case it is certain from the "Festal Letters" of <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> that in 331 the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> enjoined upon his flock a period of forty days of <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> preliminary to, but not inclusive of, the stricter <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> of <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, and secondly that in 339 the same <a href="06001a.htm">Father</a>, after having traveled to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and over the greater part of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, wrote in the strongest terms to urge this observance upon the people of <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> as one that was universally practiced, "to the end that while all the world is <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, we who are in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> should not become a laughing-stock as the only people who do not <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> but take our pleasure in those days". Although <a href="06322c.htm">Funk</a> formerly maintained that a Lent of forty days was not known in the <a href="09022a.htm">West</a> before the time of <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, this is evidence which cannot be set aside.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Duration of the fast</h2>

<p>In determining this period of forty days the example of <a href="10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="05381b.htm">Elias</a>, and <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> must have exercised a predominant influence, but it is also possible that the fact was borne in mind that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> lay forty hours in the <a href="07425a.htm">tomb</a>. On the other hand just as <a href="15614b.htm">Pentecost</a> (the fifty days) was a period during which <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were <a href="07131b.htm">joyous</a> and <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> standing, though they were not always engaged in such <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, so the <a href="12589a.htm">Quadragesima</a> (the forty days) was originally a period marked by <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, but not necessarily a period in which the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> <a href="05789c.htm">fasted</a> every day. Still, this principle was differently understood in different localities, and great divergences of practice were the result. In <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the fifth century, Lent lasted six weeks, but according to the historian <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a> there were only three weeks of actual <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, exclusive even then of the Saturday and <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> and if Duchesne's view may be trusted, these weeks were not continuous, but were the first, the fourth, and sixth of the series, being connected with the ordinations (Christian Worship, 243). Possibly, however, these three weeks had to do with the <a href="13641a.htm">"scrutinies"</a> preparatory to <a href="02258b.htm">Baptism</a>, for by some authorities (e.g., A.J. Maclean in his "Recent Discoveries") the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> along with the candidate for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> is put forward as the chief influence at work in the development of the forty days. But throughout the <a href="05230a.htm">Orient</a> generally, with some few exceptions, the same arrangement prevailed as <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius's</a> "Festal Letters" show us to have obtained in <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, namely, the six weeks of Lent were only preparatory to a <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> of exceptional severity maintained during <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>. This is enjoined by the <a href="../fathers/07155.htm">"Apostolic Constitutions" (V.13)</a>, and presupposed by <a href="08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (Hom. xxx in Gen., I). But the number forty, having once established itself, produced other modifications. It seemed to many necessary that there should not only be <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> during the forty days but forty actual <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> days. Thus we find &AElig;theria in her "Peregrinatio" speaking of a Lent of eight weeks in all observed at <a href="08355a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, which, remembering that both the Saturday and <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of ordinary weeks were exempt, gives five times eight, i.e., forty days for <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>. On the other hand, in many localities people were content to observe no more than a six weeks' period, sometimes, as at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> only five days in the week after the <a href="05230a.htm">oriental</a> fashion (<a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, "De Elia et Jejunio", 10). In the time of <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (590-604) there were apparently at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> six weeks of six days each, making thirty-six <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> days in all, which <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, who is followed therein by many <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers, describes as the spiritual <a href="14741b.htm">tithing</a> of the year, thirty-six days being approximately the tenth part of three hundred and sixty-five. At a later date the wish to realize the exact number of forty days led to the practice of beginning Lent upon our present <a href="01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>, but the <a href="10298a.htm">Church of Milan</a>, even to this day, adheres to the more primitive arrangement, which still betrays itself in the <a href="10354c.htm">Roman Missal</a> when the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="13673b.htm">Secret of the Mass</a> on the first <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of Lent speaks of "sacrificium quadragesimalis initii", the <a href="10006a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the opening of Lent.</p>



<h2>Nature of the fast</h2>

<p>Neither was there originally less divergence regarding the nature of the <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a>. For example, the historian <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26015.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.22</a>) tells of the practice of the fifth century: "Some <a href="01067a.htm">abstain</a> from every sort of creature that has <a href="09238c.htm">life</a>, while others of all the living creatures eat of fish only. Others eat birds as well as fish, because, according to the <a href="07310a.htm">Mosaic account of the Creation</a>, they too sprang from the water; others <a href="01067a.htm">abstain</a> from fruit covered by a hard shell and from eggs. Some eat dry bread only, others not even that; others again when they have <a href="05789c.htm">fasted</a> to the ninth hour (three o'clock) partake of various kinds of food". Amid this diversity some inclined to the extreme limits of rigor. <a href="13393b.htm">Epiphanius</a>, <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, and the author of the "Life of St. Melania the Younger" seem to contemplate a state of things in which ordinary <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were expected to pass twenty-four hours or more without food of any kind, especially during <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, while the more austere actually subsisted during part or the whole of Lent upon one or two meals a week (see Rampolla, "Vita di. S. Melania Giuniore", appendix xxv, p. 478). But the ordinary rule on <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> days was to take but one meal a day and that only in the evening, while meat and, in the early centuries, wine were entirely forbidden. During <a href="07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, or at least on <a href="06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> it was common to enjoin the <em>xerophagi&aelig;</em>, i.e., a diet of dry food, bread, salt, and vegetables.</p>

<p>There does not seem at the beginning to have been any prohibition of <em>lacticinia</em>, as the passage just quoted from <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a> would show. Moreover, at a somewhat later date, <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a> tells us of <a href="03475a.htm">Bishop Cedda</a>, that during Lent he took only one meal a day consisting of "a little bread, a hen's egg, and a little milk mixed with water" (<a href="../fathers/26013.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.23</a>), while <a href="14579b.htm">Theodulphus of Orleans</a> in the eighth century regarded <a href="01067a.htm">abstinence</a> from eggs, cheese, and fish as a mark of exceptional <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>. None the less <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> writing to <a href="02081a.htm">St. Augustine of England</a> laid down the rule, "We <a href="01067a.htm">abstain</a> from flesh meat, and from all things that come from flesh, as milk, cheese, and eggs." This decision was afterwards enshrined in the <a href="04391a.htm">"Corpus Juris"</a>, and must be regarded as the <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Still exceptions were admitted, and <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> to eat "lacticinia" were often granted upon condition of making a contribution to some pious work. These <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> were known in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> as Butterbriefe, and several <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> are said to have been partly built by the proceeds of such exceptions. One of the steeples of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was for this reason formerly known as the Butter Tower. This general prohibition of eggs and milk during Lent is perpetuated in the popular custom of <a href="02599b.htm">blessing</a> or making gifts of eggs at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and in the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> usage of eating pancakes on <a href="13763a.htm">Shrove Tuesday</a>.</p>

<h2>Relaxations of the lenten fast</h2>

<p>From what has been said it will be clear that in the early <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Lent throughout the greater part of the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a> consisted of forty weekdays, which were all <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> days, and six <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. From the beginning to the end of that time all flesh meat, and also, for the most part, "lacticinia", were forbidden even on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, while on all the <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> days only one meal was taken, which single meal was not permitted before evening. At a very early period, however (we find the first mention of it in <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a>), the practice began to be tolerated of breaking the <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> at the hour of <a href="11097a.htm">none</a>, i.e., three o'clock. We learn in particular that <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, about the year 800, took his lenten repast at 2 p.m. This gradual anticipation of the hour of dinner was facilitated by the fact that the <a href="07500b.htm">canonical hours</a> of <a href="11097a.htm">none</a>, <a href="15381a.htm">vespers</a>, etc., represented rather periods than fixed points of time. The ninth hour, or <a href="11097a.htm">none</a>, was no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> strictly three o'clock in the afternoon, but the <a href="11219a.htm">Office</a> of <a href="11097a.htm">none</a> might be recited as soon as <a href="13747c.htm">sext</a>, which, of course, corresponded to the sixth hour, or midday, was finished. Hence <a href="11097a.htm">none</a> in course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> came to be regarded as beginning at midday, and this point of view is perpetuated in our word <em>noon</em> which means midday and not three o'clock in the afternoon. Now the hour for breaking the <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> during Lent was after <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> (the <em>evening service</em>), but by a gradual process the recitation of <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> was more and more anticipated, until the principle was at last officially recognized, as it is at present, that <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> in lent may be said at midday. In this way, although the author of the <a href="10285a.htm">"Micrologus"</a> in the eleventh century still declared that those who took food before evening did not observe the lenten <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a> according to the <a href="03287a.htm">canons</a> (P.L., CLI, 1013), still, even at the close of the thirteenth century, certain theologians, for example the Franciscan Richard Middleton, who based his decision in part upon contemporary usage, pronounced that a <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> who took his dinner at midday did not break the lenten <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a>.</p>

<p>Still more material was the relaxation afforded by the introduction of "collation". This seems to have begun in the ninth century, when the <a href="01001a.htm#councils">Council of Aix la Chapelle</a> sanctioned the concession, even in <a href="04340c.htm">monastic houses</a>, of a draught of water or other beverage in the evening to quench the thirst of those who were exhausted by the manual labor of the day. From this small beginning a much larger indulgence was gradually evolved. The principle of <em>parvitas materiae</em>, i.e., that a small quantity of nourishment which was not taken directly as a meal did not break the <a href="05789c.htm">fast</a>, was adopted by <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> and other <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and in the course of centuries a recognized quantity of solid food, which according to received authorities must not exceed eight ounces, has come to be permitted after the midday repast. As this evening drink, when first tolerated in the ninth-century <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, was taken at the hour at which the "Collationes" (Conferences) of <a href="03404a.htm">Abbot Cassian</a> were being read aloud to the brethren, this slight indulgence came to be known as a "collation", and the name has continued since.</p>

<p>Other mitigations of an even more substantial character have been introduced into lenten observance in the course of the last few centuries. To begin with, the custom has been tolerated of taking a cup of liquid (e.g., tea or coffee, or even chocolate) with a fragment of bread or toast in the early morning. But, what more particularly regards Lent, successive <a href="07789a.htm">indults</a> have been granted by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> allowing meat at the principal meal, first on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, and then on two, three, four, and five weekdays, throughout nearly the whole of Lent. Quite recently, <a href="10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, upon which meat was hitherto always forbidden, has come to share in the same indulgence. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> grants faculties whereby working men and their <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> may use flesh meat once a day throughout the year, except Fridays, <a href="01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>, <a href="07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, and the <a href="05647a.htm">vigil</a> of <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a>. The only compensation imposed for all these mitigations is the prohibition during Lent against partaking of both fish and flesh at the same repast. (See <a href="01067a.htm">ABSTINENCE</a>; <a href="05789c.htm">FAST</a>; <a href="07695a.htm">CANONICAL IMPEDIMENTS</a>; <a href="08737c.htm">LAETARE SUNDAY</a>; <a href="13721b.htm">SEPTUAGESIMA</a>; <a href="13747a.htm">SEXAGESIMA</a>; <a href="12614a.htm">QUINQUAGESIMA</a>; <a href="12789a.htm">QUADRAGESIMA</a>; <a href="15388a.htm">VESTMENTS</a>).</p>
