<p>The Drevets were the leading portrait engravers of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> for over a hundred years. Their fame began with Pierre, and was sustained by his son, Pierre-Imbert, and by his nephew, Claude.</p>

<h2>Pierre Drevet</h2>

<p>Pierre Drevet, the Elder, b. at Loire in the Lyonnais in 1663; d. in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1738, was the son of Estienne Drevet, a man of excellent <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, and began his studies with <a href="02071a.htm">Germain Audran</a> at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, continuing them with <a href="02071a.htm">G&eacute;rard Audran</a> in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. So rapid was his progress, so quickly did he imbibe and assimilate <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and with such precision and delicacy did he manage the graver, that in 1696 he was made court engraver. In 1707 he was admitted to membership in the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts, his reception picture being an engraving of Robert de Cotte.</p>

<p>Rigaud's portraits were in high favour at the end of the seventeenth century and Drevet was the first to encounter and surmount the difficulties of translating into black and white the natural appearance of texture and materials which the brilliant oils readily presented. He was an excellent draughtsman, and he treated flesh and fabrics, the flash of jewels and the shimmer of steel, with painter-like realism, surpassing all his predecessors in these effects. With all his elegance of detail he produced an harmonious ensemble, combining artistic feeling with skilful technic. Although his work with the burin was like that of the great <a href="10682a.htm">Nanteuil</a>, he attained a style of his own. Previous engravers sacrificed much to make the head prominent, but Drevet made everything salient, though never <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a> so. Always engraving after oil-paintings, Drevet was at times uneven, but this was because the originals were uneven. Orders poured in upon him faster than he could fill them, and throughout his life he had command of every important work produced in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. His engravings were mainly the portraits of distinguished people. Among his many superb plates a portrait of <a href="04096a.htm">Colbert</a> (1700) marks the acme of his art; and next in point of excellence come the portraits of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and Louis XV, both after Rigaud. Other celebrated works of his are a Crucifixion, after Coypel, and a portrait of Charles II of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. During the last years of his life Drevet worked with his son and they produced plates together.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Pierre-Imbert Drevet</h2>

<p>Pierre-Imbert Drevet, called the Younger Pierre, was born in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1697; died there, 1739. His father, the elder Drevet, gave him such assiduous instruction that at the age of thirteen he produced a superb little plate which indicated his future eminence. At first he engraved after <a href="09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>, but he soon developed a style of his own, spontaneous, sincere, and brilliant. Under his facile, sure, and soft graver every detail was rendered, every shade of colour and every variety of texture. The result was always an harmonious unit. He was his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> constant companion and worked with unwearying patience with him. In 1723 Pierre-Imbert finished his portrait of <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> after Rigaud, "perhaps the finest of all the engraved portraits of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>" (Lippman). In 1724 the portrait of Cardinal Dubois was engraved. Both of these are treated broadly and freely, show magnificent handling of draperies, and possess exquisite finish. The great plate of Adrienne Lecouvreur (1730) and that of Samuel Bernard are by many authorities ranked with the <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>. For Bernard's portrait Rigaud himself made the drawing, a most unusual event in eighteenth-century engraving. Besides his masterly portraits, Pierre-Imbert produced many religious and historical plates, chiefly of Coypel. A sunstroke (1726) resulted in intermittent imbecility, and the talented and hardworking master &mdash; the last of the pure-line men &mdash; had thirteen years of such madness before his death. He kept on engraving, however, until the end. He was a member of the Acad&eacute;mie de Peinture and the king assigned him apartments in the Louvre. Among his pupils were Fran&ccedil;ois and Jacques Ch&eacute;reau and Simon Vall&eacute;e.</p>

<p>The following are among his principal works: "Presentation of the Virgin", after Le Brun; "Presentation in the Temple", after L. Boullogne; portraits of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> (after Vivien); and Ren&eacute; Pucelle, his last work, after Rigaud.</p>

<h2>Claude Drevet</h2>

<p>A French engraver, b. at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1705; d. in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1782. He was a nephew and pupil of Pierre the Elder and at first followed the traditions of the two Pierres, forming about him a coterie of engravers who endeavoured to keep alive their great traditions. Later he became very hard and precise with the graver, and his work lost all its artistic and painter-like quality, everything being sacrificed for a brilliant technic. Nevertheless, many of his plates possess great charm and delicacy. Claude seemed indifferent to his art and produced but little compared with the other members of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. When Pierre-Imbert died, his rooms in the Louvre were given to Claude, who proceeded to squander nearly all the money left him by his uncle and his cousin.</p>

<p>He engraved portraits of Henri Oswald, Cardinal d'Auvergne, after Rigaud, and of De Vintimille, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, also after Rigaud.</p>
