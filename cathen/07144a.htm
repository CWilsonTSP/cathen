<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Hartford, established by <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, 18 Sept., 1843. When erected it embraced the States of <a href="04253b.htm">Connecticut</a> and <a href="13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a>. As Providence was the most considerable city, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hartford resided there until 1872, when a new see was erected (see <a href="12509a.htm">D<font size=-2>IOCESE OF</font> P<font size=-2>ROVIDENCE</font></a>). As now constituted, the Diocese of Hartford is coextensive with the <a href="04253b.htm">State of Connecticut</a>. It has an area of about five thousand square miles and a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 375,000, or one-third of the total population of <a href="04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>.</p>

<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>The vestiges of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> travellers and sojourners in the territory now embraced by the Diocese of Hartford are numerous. <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants were scattered throughout the colony, and they rendered notable service during the Pequot <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of 1637. Their movements are chronicled in the governorship of Theophilus Eaton (1639-57). Their numbers became considerably augmented during the century which followed. In the War of Independence they took an important part, but they were deprived of the consolations of their religion. Throughout the Colonial period Spanish, <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a>, and French sailors and adventurers landed at New London and the other ports of the State, and some remained to spend their lives and lose their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> among those by whom the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was <a href="07149b.htm">hated</a> or feared. In the year 1756 four hundred Acadians were scattered throughout the State, but, bereft of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and plunged into a hostile atmosphere, they and their descendants made shipwreck of the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> so much cherished by their ancestors. Now and again <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> visited Connecticut, coming either as emissaries or <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to the French troops, but they took no part in the upbuilding of the future diocese. The attitude of the white settlers was decidedly hostile to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the few confessors who persevered are lost in oblivion. Bishop <a href="03650a.htm">Cheverus</a>, of <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a> (1810-23), and Bishop Fenwick, his successor, made occasional missionary journeys to Connecticut. At the request of the latter, the Rev. R. D. Woodley, of Providence, visited and ministered to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the section during the earlier months of 1828. In August of that year the Rev. Bernard O'Cavanaugh was appointed first resident <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the present Diocese of Hartford. His <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> comprised the <a href="04253b.htm">State of Connecticut</a>, and he made Hartford his home. July, 1829, was a memorable month for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the future diocese. On the 10th of that month Bishop Fenwick came to Hartford; on the 11th the first number of the "Catholic Press" appeared; on the evening of that day the visiting <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> preached to a fine concourse of people, and before departing answered an attack made upon the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the "Episcopalian Watchman". He also gave directions for the purchase of the old Episcopalian church which was subsequently moved to Talcott Street. Bishop Fenwick was pleased with the visit and wrote in his journal: "Splendid prospects for religion in Hartford". Father O'Cavanaugh laboured alone in Hartford until 1 July, 1830, when he was joined by the <a href="06084b.htm">Rev. James Fitton</a>. <a href="06084b.htm">Father Fitton</a> continued to serve in <a href="04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, sometimes alone and sometimes with one or two assistants, for six years. On the erection of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1843, there were but three resident <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>. Hartford and New Haven had <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>, but Bridgeport was attended from the latter place. <a href="06084b.htm">Father Fitton</a> ministered to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in New London, going to them from <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, where he was then stationed.</p>

<h2>Bishops of Hartford</h2>

<p>(1) WILLIAM TYLER was born at Derby, Vt., 5 June, 1806. He was from a <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of converts. His <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, with their seven children, like the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of his maternal cousin, the Rev. Virgil Barber, renounced <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the future <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> embracing the Faith in his sixteenth year. Having completed his classical course at Mr. Barber's academy at Claremont, N.H., young Tyler became a member of the household of Bishop Fenwick in 1826. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> three years later, and immediately distinguished himself for <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> on the missions of <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> and Maine. He held the office of <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a> until his promotion to the Bishopric of Hartford. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 17 March, 1844, and installed at <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> Church 14 April. At his advent the entire diocese contained 9937 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, of whom only 4817 resided in <a href="04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>. At that time Hartford was a city of 13,000 inhabitants, and of these only 600 were adult <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Providence, however, could boast of 23,000 inhabitants, 2000 of whom were adherents of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> accordingly petitioned <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to move his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> from Hartford to <a href="12509a.htm">Providence</a>, where he took up his residence in June, 1844. So poor was the Diocese of Hartford at its inception that Bishop Kendrick of Philadelphia, in writing to the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="08157a.htm">Irish College</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was constrained to make the following complaint: "The unfortunate haste with which Little Rock and Hartford were made sees in a former council should make us pause when a new <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> is to be erected". The chief anxiety of the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was to provide <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and care for the instruction of the young. His episcopal residence was a mere shanty, "which could be easily drawn by oxen from one end of Providence to the other". Bishop Tyler appealed successfully for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to All Hallows College, Dublin; he likewise received substantial aid from the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and from The Leopold Society, <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. He attended the Seventh <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> which convened 5 May, 1849. Never robust, his health was broken by consumption, and he petitioned the Fathers of the council to accept his resignation. They refused to accede to his wishes, but requested the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to grant him a coadjutor in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of the Very Rev. Bernard O'Reilly, <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="03037a.htm">Diocese of Buffalo</a>. But it was a successor and not a coadjutor that the good <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> needed, for he was called to his reward 18 July, 1849. His episcopate covered five years. Bishop Fitzpatrick characterized him as "a man of saintly life consumed with <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>".</p>

<p>(2) BERNARD O'REILLY was a native of Columkille County Longford, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where he was born in 1801. He made his classical studies before coming to America, and completed his course of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at St. Mary's Baltimore. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in New York, 13 Oct. 1831. He began his <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> life in the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, the city of <a href="02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a> being his out-mission. The future <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> distinguished himself by devoted heroism during the plague which swept over New York in 1832. He was later on transferred to Rochester, where he served with great success for fifteen years. On the erection of the <a href="03037a.htm">Diocese of Buffalo</a>, in 1847, Father O'Reilly was made <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and remained in that capacity until appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hartford. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at St. Patrick's church, Rochester, N.Y., 10 Nov., 1850. Dearth of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> was the chief anxiety which weighed upon him in his new field. "A short time since", he wrote in 1852, "our affliction was very great, when, from almost every section of the State, the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> were asking for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and we had none to give them." On his accession there were but seven <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, and five churches. The <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at once opened a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in his own house, over which he placed the Rev. Hugh Carmody. The institution prospered, and the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> body was considerably augmented. Two years after his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, Bishop O'Reilly visited <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and at All Hallows, <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, he secured several <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for his growing mission. Among these was a young man named Thomas Hendricken who laboured with distinction in <a href="04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, and later on became the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12509a.htm">Providence</a>. To provide for the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the young, Bishop O'Reilly brought to his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> the <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, establishing them in his episcopal city in 1851. When <a href="08677a.htm">Knownothingism</a> was raging, a mob assembled to demolish their <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>. The Bishop came to the rescue, making use of these words: "The Sisters are in their home; they shall not leave it for an hour. I shall protect them while I have life, and if needs be, register their safety with my blood." The mob was not prepared for such heroism. Intent upon the welfare of the young, Bishop O'Reilly went to <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> again in 1854 in order to secure the aid of the <a href="08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>. He sailed for home 23 Jan., 1856, on the ill-fated "Pacific". He perished with all hands on board. The activity of Bishop O'Reilly may be realized when it is recalled that during the six years of his episcopate he added to the equipment of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> 34 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, 28 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 5 academies, 9 <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 3 <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>. At his death there were within the present limits of the Diocese of Hartford 27 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, 26 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 2 academies, and 2 <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>.</p>

<p>(3) FRANCIS PATRICK MCFARLAND was born at Franklin, Penn., 16 April, 1819. He studied at Mt. St. Mary's, Emmitsburg, Md., and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Archbishop Hughes in New York. After teaching for a year at <a href="15203b.htm">Fordham College</a>, he was made <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Watertown, N.Y. On 1 March, 1851, he was sent to preside over the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="15241b.htm">Utica</a>. He was appointed Vicar-Apostolic of Florida 9 June, 1857. He declined the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, and was made <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hartford in March, 1858. The same labours that consumed the energies of his predecessor confronted the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>: the building of churches and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, the securing of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. The devoted <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> multiplied himself, visiting all corners of his extensive diocese, preaching, lecturing, and examining every child whom he admitted to confirmation. He went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1869 to attend the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. His health failing, he asked to be relieved from the cares of his office, or to be granted a coadjutor. Neither request was granted. But, as a compromise, the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided, the <a href="13020a.htm">State of Rhode Island</a> being cut off. Dr. McFarland retained his title of <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hartford, and came to reside in his episcopal city in February, 1872. He immediately addressed himself to the labour of erecting a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, an episcopal residence, and a mother-house for the <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, who were already engaged in <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> work throughout the State. Two of these works he lived to complete. The third, the stately edifice of which the faithful of the Diocese of Hartford are so justly proud, was well started before his death. He departed this life 2 Oct., 1874, in the fifty-sixth year of his age and the seventeenth of his episcopate. He was a scholar and a man of rare <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.</p>

<p>(4) THOMAS GALBERRY was likewise born outside of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, coming from <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> with his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> at the tender age of three years. He was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at Villanova College, and was called from the presidency of that institution to the See of Hartford in 1875. When notified of his elevation, he declined the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, and begged the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to relieve him of the burden. A mandamus was returned 17 Feb., 1876. He then proceeded to prepare for his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. On coming to Hartford he selected St. Peter's church for his procathedral, pushing forward the erection of the new edifice with energy. He set out for his ad limina visit in May, 1876. Returning in autumn, his health began to fail, but he ceased not to provide churches and <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious teachers for his rapidly developing diocese. Seeking rest, he set out for Villanova College 10 Oct., 1878. On the way to New York he was stricken with a haemorrhage and died in the Grand Union Hotel a few hours later. During his episcopate "The Connecticut <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>" was established, and since that memorable day, in 1876, the Diocese of Hartford has never been without a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper.</p>

<p>(5) LAWRENCE S. MCMAHON, the fifth <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hartford, though a native of St. John's, N.B., spent his childhood and youth in Cambridge, Mass. He entered Holy Cross College, Worcester, <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, at the age of fifteen. He pursued his higher studies in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> 21 March, 1860. He was serving as assistant at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a> when the 28th <a href="10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> called from swamps of <a href="14157a.htm">South Carolina</a> for a <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. Father McMahon volunteered, and served with distinction until his health completely failed him. After the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> he became <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> successively of Bridgewater and New Bedford. He was the first <a href="15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="12509a.htm">Diocese of Providence</a> and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hartford 10 August, 1879. His great work in his new field was the erection and the adornment of St. Joseph's Cathedral. In ten years he collected more than $500,000, and on 8 May, 1892, he <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the splendid edifice free from all <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a>. While engaged in this work, he gave direction for the wise development of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, organizing 18 new <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, dedicating 70 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, and establishing 16 <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, as well as 16 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>. He died at Lakeville, 21 August, 1893, and was <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> in the great <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to erect which he had laboured so hard and with such distinguished success.</p>

<p>(6) MICHAEL TIERNEY was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Hartford 22 Feb., 1891. Born in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he spent his youth at Norwalk, in the diocese over which he was destined to preside with such fruit. After completing his studies at Bardstown, at <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and at Troy, New York, he was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in May, 1866. Bishop McFarland immediately made the young <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> his chancellor and the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which offices he held until his appointment as <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of New London. After a year in that post he was transferred to Stamford, and three years later he was promoted to the rectorship of St. Peter's church, Hartford. Here, besides his <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, he was charged with the responsible office of inspecting the erection of the new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> - a post for which he was admirably fitted by his aptitude for the technical details of the building art as well as by his experience at <a href="12509a.htm">Providence</a>, New London, and Stamford, where he was called upon successively to erect a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, to rebuild a church, and push to completion one of the stateliest <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> edifices in New England. Previously to the episcopate of Bishop Tierney, the resources at the disposal of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> were mainly absorbed in the erection of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and it happened that there were within the confines of the State but few <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. The new <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> felt the need of a preparatory college for boys destined for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and proceeded to erect one in his episcopal city. The foundation flourished, and before his death, that is, during the first decade of its existence, St. Thomas's Seminary could boast of 100 students. Other charitable works established under Bishop Tierney's inspiration are St. Mary's Home for the Aged, St. John's Industrial School, the <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport, Waterbury, Willimantic, and the numerous charitable enterprises conducted by the Sisters of the Holy Ghost and the <a href="12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>. Bishop Tierney was a man of tireless activity. He multiplied himself, visiting every <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> and every school-room in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> at least once a year. During his episcopate he confirmed 85,000 children and administered to every one of them the total-abstinence pledge. He was a patron of literature and established a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> missionary band to preach retreats to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics. He died on 5 Oct., 1908, universally mourned.</p>

<h2>Present condition of the diocese</h2>

<p>Within the limits of the <a href="04253b.htm">State of Connecticut</a> there are now at least 375,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
