<p>Until the eighth century the Arabians, although they expressed their religious feelings in a somewhat mystic poetry, failed to give expression to their thoughts about the world around them, except in so far as those thoughts may be said to be expressed in the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a>. It was only when they came in contact with other civilizations, notably with that of <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>, that their speculative and scientific activities were stimulated into action. A circumstance which favoured the study of letters and philosophy was the accession to the throne about A.D. 750 of the Abassides, an enlightened line of Caliphs who encouraged learning, and patronized the representatives, chiefly Syrian and Persian, of foreign culture. The introduction of foreign <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> resulted first in a twofold movement among the followers of <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>. There was on the one hand a movement in the direction of <a href="07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a>, a kind of <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> questioning of the authority of the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a>, which led to the rejection of the current <a href="01558c.htm">anthropomorphism</a> and fatalism. The representatives of this movement were called "Motazilites" or "Dissidents". They were the first <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> of <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a>. Opposed to this movement was the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> current, tending to emphasize more and more the authority of the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a>, while, at the same time, it attempted to do this by the aid of Greek philosophy and <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. The representatives of this movement were called the "Motacallimin", or "professors of the word". They were <a href="12652a.htm">rationalists</a>, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, in so far as they fell back on Greek philosophy for their metaphysical and physical explanations of phenomena; still, it was their aim to keep within the limits of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>. In this they bore a close resemblance to the first <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In reaction against both the "Motazilites" aud "Motacallimin" arose the "Sufis", or "Mystics", who flourished chiefly in the Persian portion of the Arabian Empire. They represented the most extreme phase of protest against all <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> inquiry; they condemned the use of Greek philosophy even within the limits of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and taught that whatever <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> there is can be attained by reverent reading of the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a> and meditation on the words of the <a href="../bible.html">sacred text</a>. They placed contemplation above observation and inquiry, and set more value on <a href="05277a.htm">ecstatic</a> meditation than on the study of <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. From the conflict of these divergent forces there arose, about the ninth century, the tendency of thought represented by the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a>. These <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> had more in common with the Dissidents and the <a href="14580a.htm">Theologians</a> than with the Mystics; they made ample use of Greek philosophy, and in their free inquiry into the secrets of nature, in which they soon outstripped the Greeks themselves, they paid little attention to the authority of the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a>. For this reason they fell into disrepute with the rulers both in North Africa and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, as well as in the East, and instances of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, exile, and death inflicted by the Caliphs on the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a> were of frequent occurrence from the ninth century to the thirteenth.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Taking its origin from the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>, the philosophy of the Arabians was at first <a href="12159a.htm">Platonic</a> in spirit and tendency. The Arabians translated the "Timaeus", the "Republic", and the "Laws", and when, attracted by the medical treatises of Galen, they were led to the study of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, they translated not only the genuine writings of the <a href="01713a.htm">Stagirite</a>, but also the so-called "Theologia Aristotelis" which was merely a compilation from the "Enneads" of Plotinus, and the famous "Liberde Causis" which was a compilation from the "Elements of Theology" of Proclus. Thus, from the beginning, they imparted to <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> teaching a <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> meaning, and even those among them who came to be recognized as the most faithful exponents of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a> were not entirely free from the influence of the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>. Plotinus's view of reality, as a kind of pyramid with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> at the apex and material things at the base, and Proclus's view of hypostatized <a href="15182a.htm">universals</a> as constituting a <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of "Causes", mediating between <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and matter, came to be the recognized views in the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of Eastern and Western <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a>.</p>

<p>Among the most famous of the Arabian <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the East were Alkendi or Alkindi (d. about the year 870), Alfarabi (d. about 950), <a href="02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, or Ibn Sina (980-1037), the <a href="02025a.htm">astronomer</a> Alhazen (eleventh century), and Algazel, or Gazali (1059-1111). In the West, that is in Northern Africa and in <a href="10424a.htm">Moorish</a> <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the most celebrated <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were <a href="02150a.htm">Avempace</a>, or Ibn Badsha (d. 1138), Abubacer, or Abn Bekr, also called Ibn Tofail (1100-85), and <a href="02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, or Ibn Roshd (1126-98). Of these <a href="02150a.htm">Avempace</a>, <a href="02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, and <a href="02150c.htm">Averroes</a> were best known to the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. <a href="02156a.htm">Avicebrol</a>, whom the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> regarded as an Arabian, was in reality a Jewish <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and poetic writer named Salomon ben Gabirol. The philosophy of the Arabians is not distinguished by its originality; in point of fact, it is merely an interpretation of Greek philosophy and, even as an interpretation, adds little to the interpretations already given by Plotinus, Proclus, Simplicius, and the Syrian <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>. It is Arabian only in the sense that it was written in Arabic &#151; the greatest of its representatives, <a href="02157a.htm">Avicenna</a> and <a href="02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, were not natives of the Arabian peninsula at all. In one respect only did the Arabians develop Greek philosophy, namely, in its relation to medicine, and it was in this regard that they exerted the most far-reaching influence in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a> from whom they borrowed their interpretation of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, the Arabians were pantheists or semi-pantheists. <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> taught that matter is the eternal substratum of movement; in <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>, taught the Arabian commentators, there is no distinction between the actual and the possible, between the substratum, or subject, of movement and the Mover. Therefore, whenever the Arabians had the <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> of their convictions they taught more or less openly that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the First Mover, is really the subject of movement, that He and the Universe are substantially identical. The various teachers, however, compromise more or less successfully between <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="11447b.htm">pantheism</a> and the <a href="10499a.htm">monotheism</a> of the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a>. With regard to the government of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>, the Arabians taught that <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> is concerned only with the universal, not with the particular. The world, says <a href="02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, is a city which is governed from the centre by a ruler whose immediate authority extends only to his own palace, but who, through his subordinates, rules each and every district of the city subject to his sway. This <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> implied the mediation of numberless beings from the Highest Intelligence down to the lowest material creature. From <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is indeed the Author, though He cannot be called the Creator, of the Universe, there emanates in the first place, the First Intelligence (akin to the <em>Logos</em> of <a href="12023a.htm">Philo</a>), then the Second Intelligence, and so on, down to the lowest of all the cosmic intelligences, the intelligence which animates and directs the sphere of the moon. Each of these intelligences is incorporated in, or inhabits a heavenly sphere &#151; hence the close dependence of <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="02018e.htm">astrology</a> on the Arabians, and on their immediate disciples in <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, as, for instance, <a href="13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a>. The lowest intelligence, to which reference has just been made (the intelligence which rules the sphere of the moon), plays an important part in the <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> of the Arabians. In treating of <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> taught that in the acquisition of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> a twofold <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> principle is involved, the one active and the other passive. The text of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> being obscure at this point (De Anima, Book III), the commentators were at a loss to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> what the <a href="01713a.htm">Stagirite</a> meant by the "active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>". The Arabians here, as elsewhere, took up the tradition of the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>. The latter had taught that the "active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>" is something physically distinct from the individual <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>; an intelligence, namely, that is, somehow, common to all men. The Arabians adopted this monopsychism and made it part of their <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a>. There is, they taught, but one active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> and that is common to all men. It resides in the sphere of the moon, but, being brought, in some way, into contact with the individual <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> (which thereby "participates" in it), it generates there the universal, abstract, immaterial, <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>. It was principally against this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the unity and separation of the active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> that the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> directed their attacks on the Arabians. The <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> objected to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on two accounts. They denied that it was a tenable <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a>, and they denied that it was a faithful interpretation of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. This is the main contention of <a href="01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> and <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, both of whom wrote special treatises on the unity of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and on one point at least the most unsympathetic critic of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> agrees with them, namely, when they argue that monopsychism is not in keeping with the general tone and spirit of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> philosophy.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Another aspect of monopsychism to which the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> did not fail to call attention was its bearing on the question of <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>. The passive <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the Arabians taught, is material, and perishes with the body. The active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, although it is immaterial and, therefore, imperishable, is not part of the individual <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. There is nothing, therefore, in man that has the power of resisting death; and to say that man is <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a> because the impersonal, universal, <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> is <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a> has no more meaning than if one were to say that man is <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a> because the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature are <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a>. This conclusion is frankly admitted by <a href="02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, who teaches that according to philosophy the human <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is mortal, although according to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> it is <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a>. This admission of the principle of two-fold <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> (namely, that what is <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> may be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and vice versa) shows more clearly than anything else the inherent irreconcilability of Arabian philosophy and <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. The <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> movement from beginning to end, whatever may be its deviations and aberrations on other points, held steadfastly to the principle that, since <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is the Author of all <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of reason and the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of revelation (that is, philosophy and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>) cannot come to any real conflict. The beginning of the decline of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> dates from the introduction (from <a href="01663a.htm">Arabian</a> sources) into the Schools of the principle of twofold <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. In the acquisition of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the Arabians taught, there is a contact (<em>copulatio, continuatio</em>) of the impersonal active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> with the individual passive <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>. The contact, indeed, is only momentary. The passive <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, however, has a longing for the active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, desires it, as matter desires form. Hence the tendency on the part of the individual <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> towards a more permanent union with the great Impersonal Intellect, a union that is to be attained by the practice of asceticism and the exercise of the contemplative powers of the mind. In this union man becomes a saint and a seer, a being divine rather than human; in this state of <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> all that is base and petty becomes transformed into the sublime and noble, until at last man can exclaim, "I am <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>". Here again one sees how closely the Arabian reproduces the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of purification and <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>. It is only fair, however, to add that some of the more faithful <a href="01713a.htm">Aristoteleans</a> among the Arabians, such as <a href="02150c.htm">Averroes</a>, were content to put scientific <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the place of <a href="05277a.htm">ecstatic</a> contemplation, and thus succeeded in avoiding the contradictions implied in the <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> of the Sufis.</p>

<p>The Arabian philosophy, as is well known, exercised a profound influence on the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> of the twelfth and succeeding centuries. It is not so well-known that, even when <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> was at its height, when Albert and Thomas were attracting attention by their brilliant exposition of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> philosophy, there was in the very heart of the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> stronghold, the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, a group of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who openly professed adherence to the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="02150c.htm">Averroes</a>. And this counter current of <a href="02150c.htm">Averroism</a> is traceable in the progress of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> down to the time of the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. Still, one must not overrate the <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> which <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> owes to "Arabism" as it was called. The Arabians contributed in a very large degree to making <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> known in <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>; however, in doing this, they were but transmitting what they themselves had received from <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> sources; and, moreover, the <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> who finally gained recognition in <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> was not the Arabian <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, but the Greek <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, who came to Western <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> by way of Constantinople. The Arabians, in the second place, contributed to <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> medicine, geography, <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, arithmetic, and chemistry, but failed to exert any direct influence in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. They provoked discussion, their doctrines were the occasion of disputation and controversy, and thus, indirectly, they contributed to developing the philosophy of the Schools; but, beyond this they cannot be said to have contributed towards shaping the course of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> thought. Indeed the whole spirit of Arabian philosophy &#151; its tendency towards materialistic <a href="11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, its <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the unity of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, its hesitation on the problem of individual <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and, above all, its <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the twofold <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> &#151; must have revealed at every point of possible contact the utter impossibility of a reconciliation between Arabian and <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>, or some of them at least, drew largely from <a href="02156a.htm">Avicebrol's</a> "Fons Vitae"; but, though they did not suspect it, their teacher in that case was a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>, not an Arabian. Indeed whatever influence came from the Mosque passed through the <a href="14379b.htm">Synagogue</a> before it reached the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. When Arabian works were translated into Latin the translation was often made from the Hebrew translation of the Arabic text, and the <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> was often the only means of interchange of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> between <a href="10424a.htm">Moorish</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Whatever <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> owes to the Arabians, it owes in equal, if not in greater measure, to the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>
