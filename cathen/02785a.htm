<p>The Brigittine Order (also, ORDER OF ST. SAVIOUR) was founded in 1346 by St. Brigit, or Bridget, of Sweden at <a href="15248c.htm">Vadstena</a> in the <a href="16053b.htm">Diocese of Link&ouml;ping</a>. The saint, who was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> twenty years after her death, was a <a href="14347a.htm">Swedish</a> princess renowned for her <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> from her childhood; she was given in marriage to Ulf, Prince of Mercia, by whom she had a large <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. Ulf died in 1344, and two years later tradition relates that St. Bridget had revealed to her the rule of the new order she was to found at <a href="15248c.htm">Vadstena</a>. Here with the help of King Magnus she established on her own estate the first <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> for men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, of which Katherine, her daughter, became the first <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> soon after her death in 1375. At this time <a href="10452a.htm">double monasteries</a> were not unusual: the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> used the same <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, but lived in separate wings of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, the confessor alone having access to the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. In Brigittine <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, who were strictly enclosed, attended to the cooking, washing, and making and mending of clothes for the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> as well as for themselves, but everything was passed through a turnstile from one wing to the other. This arrangement, unsuitable to modern times, has long ceased.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the new order the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, who was called the "Sovereign", was supreme in all things temporal for both houses; all deeds were in her name, all charters were addressed to her; but in spiritual things the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> was not allowed to interfere with the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who were <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> were under the direction of the superior of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who was appointed confessor-general. The order was founded principally for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, and for this reason the supreme government was vested in the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>; the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were founded to give the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> the spiritual help they needed. The special interior devotion of the order is to the <a href="11527b.htm">Passion of Our Lord</a> and to <a href="15464b.htm">His Blessed Mother</a>.</p>

<h2>Rule of St. Bridget</h2>

<p>The Rule enacts "that the number of choir <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> shall not exceed sixty, with four lay sisters; the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> shall be thirteen, according to the number of the thirteen Apostles, of whom Paul the thirteenth was not the least in toil; then there must be four <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, who also may be <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> if they will, and they are the figure of the four principal Doctors, <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory</a> and <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, then eight <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, who with their labours shall minister necessaries to the <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, therefore counting three-score sisters, thirteen <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, four <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and the eight servitors, the number of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> will be the same as the thirteen Apostles and the seventy-two disciples". (The Rule of St Bridget.) The <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> were not to be professed before they were eighteen and the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> not before they were twenty-five years of age. The counsel of holy poverty is strictly enjoined by the Rule on all the members of the order, who are forbidden to possess anything, though at the same time they may expect the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> to supply them with all necessaries; one luxury is allowed them, they may have as many books as they like for study. All the cast-off clothing and the surplus of their yearly income, after all has been provided for, are to be given to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the Rule strictly forbids the <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> to make larger buildings than are <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>.</p>

<p>The Constitutions were first approved by <a href="15214a.htm">Pope Urban V</a>, afterwards by <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, and finally by <a href="09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. In 1603 <a href="04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> made certain changes for <a href="10452a.htm">double monasteries</a> in <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and in 1622 <a href="07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> changed certain articles in the Constitutions which refer only to double <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> for the Monastery of Ste. Marie de Foi, in the Diocese of Ypres. These new Constitutions <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> that manual work should be done during certain hours of the day by the members of the order, that a red cross should be worn on the mantle, that the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> might be professed at the age of sixteen, and that the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> should say the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> according to the <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>. Those who followed these Constitutions took the name of Brigittines Novissimi of the Order of St. Saviour, to distinguish them from those who lived in double <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>.</p>

<h2>Foundations</h2>

<p>The order spread into <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="11117b.htm">Norway</a>, <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="06076d.htm">Finland</a>, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Four foundations were made in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> at <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a>, Valenciennes, <a href="01752c.htm">Arras</a>, and <a href="05138a.htm">Douai</a>, but all were destroyed in the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. In <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> several houses were founded, but except that of Dendermonde they did not last very long, and all have now disappeared. The first Italian house was founded in 1394, when the Monastery of Paradiso was opened at the gates of Florence, and about this time some of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of the order took up their abode in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the house in which St. Bridget died. In 1426 a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was opened at <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and that same year the order was introduced into <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, where several foundations were made, one of which still remains. This is the celebrated old <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monastery of Mary Altom&uuml;nster, between <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> and Augsburg, of which the Brigittines took possession in 1497 establishing a double <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> there. This <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was twice plundered and partially destroyed by fire, and the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> who were dispersed at the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> twice returned to it. In 1803 it was suppressed, and it is only Since 1844 that a community of Brigittine <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> again lives there. The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Revel in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> was burnt by schismatics in 1575, but in <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> most of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were preserved till the middle of the sixteenth century, and three new foundations were made. <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> still possesses two Brigittine houses, both of which now take pupils.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>At the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> most of the <a href="10452a.htm">double monasteries</a> had to be given up, and the rule as to numbers could no longer be observed, while many of the houses were suppressed altogether. The <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> at <a href="15248c.htm">Vadstena</a> endured much <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> at this time; the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> threatened to tear them to pieces and expelled them from their <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but in 1588, King John III became their protector, and restored their <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> to them. In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> the Brigittine Order is the only pre-Reformation order in existence. The celebrated <a href="14394b.htm">Brigittine Monastery of Syon House</a> was founded in 1415, when Henry V himself laid the foundation-stone on part of the royal manor of Isleworth on the Thames. It is supposed that the cause of the extension of the order in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> was due to the fact that Henry's sister Philippa was the wife of Eric XIII, King of Sweden. King Henry endowed the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> richly and transferred the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of certain houses dependent on <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> to <a href="14394b.htm">Syon</a>. At the <a href="10455a.htm">dissolution of monasteries</a> under <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, who in the earlier years of his reign had himself been a benefactor of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> were dispersed and took refuge in a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of their order at Dendermonde in <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. Here they were visited by <a href="12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, and through his influence were re-established at <a href="14394b.htm">Syon</a> under <a href="09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, but they were driven into exile again when Elizabeth came to the throne, and returned to Dendermonde. After several attempts to settle in different parts of <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, they went to Rouen where they remained fourteen years, and finally in 1594, they moved to <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> where they remained for 267 years. In 1809 an attempt was made to return to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, but it was not till 1861 that the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> found a home at Spettisbury in Dorsetshire, whence they moved to Chudleigh in Devonshire in 1887, where they are still living.</p>

<h2>Brigittines of the Recollection</h2>

<p>The Brigittines of the Recollection were founded at Valladolid in the seventeenth century by Venerable Marina de Escobar, formerly a <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a>, who modified the Rule to suit the Spanish nation and the age in which she lived. The Constitutions were approved by <a href="15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a>. Like St. Bridget she neither took the habit herself nor did she live to see the first <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the order erected. This congregation which has five houses was founded for <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> only, the habit and the office differ slightly from those of the Brigittines.</p>

<p>In all houses of the Brigittine Order <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> are constantly offered for the restoration of the Monastery of Vadstena. This was formerly the great centre and stronghold of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, a place where kings and queens frequently visited, sometimes took refuge, and were occasionally <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, but which was suppressed and the religious dispersed under Gustavus Vasa. Nine Brigittine <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are now in existence: <a href="14394b.htm">Syon Abbey</a>, Chudleigh in Devonshire, Altomunster in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Uden and Weert in <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>; and the five Spanish houses of the Brigittines of the Recollection: Valladolid founded in 1651, Vittoria founded in 1653, Lasarte and Parades de Nava in 1671, and Ascoytia in 1690.</p>
