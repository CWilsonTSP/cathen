<p>(Nagasakiensis).</p>

<p>Nagasaki, capital of the prefecture (<em>ken</em>) of the same name, is situated on a small peninsula on the south-eastern coast of the Island of Kiushiu, <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a>. Its harbour, enclosed on three sides by mountains sloping down to the sea-shore and sheltered on the fourth (the entrance) by numerous islands, is one of the safest and most important in <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a>. Being the first port of entry for vessels coming from the south and west, it is also one of the leading coaling-stations of the Far East. The principal industries of the town are the manufacture of engines and ship-building. It imports mainly cotton, coal, sugar, and petroleum; among its chief exports are coal, rice, flour, camphor, and tobacco. In the first ten centuries of our era we find references to the town under no less than seven distinct names, of which <em>Fukaye no Ura</em> (Fukaye Bay) is the best known. Its present name is probably derived from a certain Nagasaki Kotaro, who, about 1185-90, received Fukaye no Ura as his fief. Prior to the arrival of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries, however, Nagasaki was an insignificant village.</p>

<p>Although <a href="06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> missionary labours in <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> were confined to the territory now included in the Diocese of Nagasaki &#151; the <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of this territory is practically identical with the early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> history of <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> &#151; the town of Nagasaki appears not to have been visited by the missionaries until 1569. In this year Father Vilela, S.J., erected a church on the site of a pagoda which had been given him by the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> lord of the district, and in 1571 had already made 1500 converts. In 1570 the <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> began trading with Nagasaki. Yinzeyemon, the imperial governor of the province, received them kindly, and, perhaps to induce them to trade with him alone, and thus to prevent others from obtaining fire-arms, affected to favour the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. When, however, the traders and missionaries, as a safeguard against future oppression, insisted on his recognizing the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority over the territory of Nagasaki, he showed great hesitation and yielded to their wishes only when they threatened to withdraw and choose some other headquarters if their request were refused. From the arrival of the foreigners dates the rapid growth of Nagasaki, numbers of the native merchants settling in the town in the hope of enriching themselves by foreign commerce. By 1587 the last traces of the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> and Shinto <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> had vanished from the district, which already contained three principal churches (called by the <a href="08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <em>Ki-kuwan</em> "strange sight") and numerous <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>. To 1587 must also be referred Hideyoshi's sudden change of attitude towards <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> (see <a href="08297a.htm">J<font size=-2>APAN</font></a>). Influenced by the bonzes' insinuations concerning the ultimate aim of the missionaries, he issued, during a night of orgy (24 July), a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> proscribing the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> and ordering the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to leave <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> within twenty days. Subsequently, however, the taiko grew calmer and consented to ten fathers remaining at Nagasaki, nor did he adopt any active measures to suppress <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as long as outward respect was shown for his decrees.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The San Felipe incident, however (see <a href="08297a.htm">J<font size=-2>APAN</font></a>), led to a new persecution in 1596, and twenty-six missionaries (6 <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, 3 <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and 17 <a href="08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>) were crucified at Nagasaki in 1597. Persistent rumors that the taiko was about to revisit Kiushiu in person led the Governor of Nagasaki, who had previously shown himself not unfavourable towards the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to send a force to destroy the churches and residences of the missionaries in 1598. In the territory of the present Diocese of Nagasaki 137 churches of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were demolished, as well as their college in Amakusa and their <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> in Arima. The death of Hideyoshi on 16 Sept., 1598, put an end to this <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Iyeyasu, anxious to promote commerce with the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, allowed free ingress to the missionaries, and, beyond enforcing the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> that no <em>daimio</em> should receive <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, showed at first no hostility to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In 1603 Nagasaki, the population of which had grown from about 2500 to 24,500 in fifty years, possessed eleven churches. About 1612 or 1613 the bonzes &#151; assisted, it is to be feared, by some English and <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> captains &#151; succeeded in thoroughly alarming Iyeyasu as to some imaginary intrigue between certain of his officers and the representatives of Philip III of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. On 27 January, 1614, orders were issued for the expulsion of the missionaries and the destruction of the churches. In 1622, Nagasaki was the scene of the "Great Martyrdom". (See <a href="09744a.htm">J<font size=-2>APANESE</font> M<font size=-2>ARTYRS</font></a>) In 1629 the custom of <em>Fumi-ye</em>, or trampling on the crucifix, was introduced; paper pictures were at first used, but later more durable images were utilized &#151; at first wood, and still later (1669) 20 bronze images cast by an engraver of Nagasaki from metal obtained from the altars of the demolished churches. Between the 4th and 9th day of the first month of each year all suspect <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were called upon to trample on these images: those who refused were banished from their homes, and when again caught, if still recalcitrant, were taken to the boiling springs of Shimabara and thrown in, or subjected to crucifixion and various kinds of refined torture. Goaded into action by such <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> and by the miseries consequent on the suppression of the <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, which had been the only source of alleviation for the needs of the impoverished peasantry, the people rose in revolt, in 1637, but, after some fierce fighting, were crushed by the shogun's forces, assisted by <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a> artillery. In 1640 four Portuguese envoys from <a href="09481b.htm">Macao</a> were seized at Nagasaki, and, on refusing to <a href="01624b.htm">apostatize</a>, were <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</p>

<p>For more than two centuries after 1640, <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> was practically closed to the outside world. The persistent attempts of missionaries to penetrate into the country during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had no other success than that of winning them the <a href="09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown. The discovery of a large body of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> by Father Petitjean on 17 March, 1865, when he was establishing the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in Nagasaki, after the reopening of <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> to the missionaries, has been referred to in the article <a href="08297a.htm">J<font size=-2>APAN</font></a>. In 1866 this <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary was created <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Myriophyte and <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and in 1876, on the division of the territory into two vicariates, he retained the administration of Southern <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> (1879-85). On the cessation of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> (see <a href="08297a.htm">J<font size=-2>APAN</font></a>), Mgr Petitjean devoted his whole energy to winning back into the Fold the descendants of the old <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, organizing the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> districts, and founding a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the formation of a native <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He was succeeded as Vicar Apostolic by Mgr Julius Alphonsus Cousin (b. April, 1842), now <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nagasaki. Father Cousin landed in <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> in 1866, and was the first missionary to penetrate into the Goto Islands. In 1869 he founded the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> station at <a href="11333b.htm">Osaka</a>, where he laboured for eighteen years. Created <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01105c.htm">Acmonia</a> in 1885, on succeeding Mgr Petitjean, he fixed his residence at Nagasaki, when Southern <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> was divided into two vicariates, in 1887. In 1890 the First Synod of <a href="08297a.htm">Japan</a> was held at Nagasaki, of which Mgr Cousin became first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, on the establishment of the <a href="08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, in 1891. In 1897 the third centennial of the twenty-six <a href="09744a.htm">Japanese martyrs</a>, <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1867, was celebrated by the construction and solemn benediction of the church of Our Lady of Martyrs at Nagasaki. The episcopal jubilee of Bishop Cousin was celebrated in 1910. During his episcopate of twenty-five years, Bishop Cousin has laboured to increase the native <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to extend the work of the mission. He has <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> 40 <a href="08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, founded 35 new stations (with residences), established 38 new <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> settlements, and built 50 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>. During his administration the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population has more than doubled.</p>
