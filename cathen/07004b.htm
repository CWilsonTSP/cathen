<p>(ALESSANDRO LUDOVISI).</p>

<p>Born at Bologna, 9 or 15 January, 1554; died at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 8 July, 1623. After completing the humanities and philosophy under <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> teachers, partly at the Roman and partly at the German College in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he returned to Bologna to devote himself to the study of <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. After graduating at the <a href="02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a> in canon and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>, he went back to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was appointed judge of the Capitol by <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> made him referendary of both signatures and member of the rota, and appointed him vicegerent in temporal affairs of Cardinal Vicar Rusticuccio. In 1612 <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a> appointed him <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Bologna, and sent him as <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, to mediate between Duke Charles Emmanuel of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> and King Philip of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in their dispute concerning the Duchy of Monferrat. In 1616 the same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> created him <a href="03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Transpontina. Henceforth Ludovisi remained at his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> in Bologna until he came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> after the death of <a href="11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a> to take part in the election of a new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. On 9 February Ludovisi himself was elected successor of <a href="11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, chiefly through the influence of Cardinal Borghese, and took the name of Gregory XV. Although at his elevation to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne he had already reached the age of 67 years and was, moreover, in a bad state of health, his pontificate of two years and five months was one of remarkable activity. He saw that he needed a strong and energetic man, in whom he could place implicit confidence, to assist him in the government of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. His nephew Ludovico Ludovisi, a young man of 25 years, seemed to him to be the right <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> and, at the risk of being charged with nepotism, he created him <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on the third day of his pontificate. On the same day, Orazio, a brother of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, was put at the head of the pontifical army. The future revealed that Gregory XV was not disappointed in his nephew. Ludovico, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, advanced the interests of his <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> in every possible way, but he also used his brilliant talents and his great influence for the welfare of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and was sincerely devoted to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Eleven <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in all were created by Gregory XV.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>One of the most important pontifical acts of Gregory XV, affecting the inner affairs of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, was his new regulation concerning papal elections. In his <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Aeterni Patris" (15 Nov., 1621) he prescribes that in the future only three modes of papal election are to be allowed: scrutiny, compromise, and quasi-inspiration. His <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Decet Romanum Pontificem" (12 March, 1622) contains a ceremonial which regulates these three modes of election in every detail. The ordinary mode of election was to be election by scrutiny, which required that the vote be secret, that each <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> give his vote to only one candidate and that no one vote for himself. Most of the papal elections during the sixteenth century were influenced by political conditions and by party considerations in the <a href="03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>. By introducing secrecy of vote Pope Gregory XV intended to abolish these abuses. The rules and ceremonies prescribed by Gregory XV are substantially the same as those that guide the papal elections of our day. Gregory XV took great interest in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions in foreign countries. These missions had become so extensive and the missionary countries differed so greatly in language, manners, and civilization from the countries of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, that it was extremely difficult to keep a proper control over them. At the request of the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Girolamo da Narni and the Discalced <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Dominicus a Jesu-Maria, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> established on 6 January, 1622, a special congregation of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who were to have supreme control over all foreign missions (<a href="12456a.htm">Congregatio de Propaganda Fide</a>). <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> and <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> had already previously formed temporary congregations of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to look after the interest of particular foreign missions, but Gregory XV was the first to erect a permanent congregation, whose sphere of activity should extend over all foreign missions (see <a href="12456a.htm">PROPAGANDA</a>). For particulars concerning the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the new congregation see the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Inscrutabili" of 22 June, 1622, in "Bullarium Romanum", XII, 690-3.</p>

<p>Both Gregory XV and his nephew Ludovico held the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in high esteem, especially the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. On 12 March, 1622, he <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="07639c.htm">Ignatius of Loyola</a>, their founder, and Francis Xavier, their most successful missionary. He had already permitted them on 2 October, 1621, to recite the office and celebrate the mass in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a> youth <a href="01331c.htm">Aloysius of Gonzaga</a>. Other <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders he <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the same way. On 12 March, 1622, he <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> Philip Neri, the founder of the <a href="11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>, and Theresa, the reformer of the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In the same year he <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> <a href="01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>, the great <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, and permitted the feast and the office of Ambrogio Sansedoni, another <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, to be celebrated as that of a saint. On 18 April, 1622, he <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> the <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="06281a.htm">Minorite</a>, Peter of Alcantara, and on 17 Feb., 1623, he ordered the feast of <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, the founder of the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, to be entered in the <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>. One <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>, the Spanish husbandman <a href="08189a.htm">Isidore</a>, he <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> on 22 March, 1622. During his short pontificate he approved the famous <a href="10069b.htm">Maurist Congregation</a> of B&eacute;n&eacute;dictines, the Congregation of the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Calvary (<a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> de Notre-Dame du Calvaire), the <a href="14557a.htm">Theatine</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> and the <a href="14557a.htm">Theatine</a> <a href="07280a.htm">recluses</a>, the Congregation of Pious Workmen (Pii Operarii), the Priests of St. Briget in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (Fratres novissimi Brigittini), and raised the <a href="13588a.htm">Piarists</a> and the <a href="04052b.htm">Priests of the Mother of God</a> (Clerici regulares Matria Dei) to the dignity of a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order. On 18 March, 1621, he founded at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> an international college for the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, the Collegium Gregorianum which was the cradle of the now famous international <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> college of <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>. Before passing to the political achievements of Gregory XV, mention must be made of his Constitution "Omnipotentis Dei", issued against magicians and <a href="15674a.htm">witches</a> on 20 March, 1623. It is the last <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> ordinance against <a href="15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>. Former punishments were lessened, and the <a href="12565a.htm">death penalty</a> was decreed only upon those who were <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> to have entered into a compact with the devil, and to have committed <a href="07441a.htm">homicide</a> with his assistance.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The great activity which Gregory XV displayed in the inner management of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was equalled by his efficacious interposition in the politics of the world, whenever the interests of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> were involved. He gave great financial assistance to Emperor Ferdinand II in regaining the <a href="02612b.htm">Kingdom of Bohemia</a> and the hereditary dominions of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Gregory XV then sent Carlos Caraffa as <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, to assist the emperor by his advice in his efforts to suppress <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, especially in <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Moravia, where the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> considerably outnumbered the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. To a great extent it was also due to the influence of Gregory XV that, at a meeting of princes at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, the Palatinate and the electoral dignity attached to it were granted to Duke Maximilian of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in the early part of January, 1623. In order to effect this grant, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had previously sent the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Father Hyacinth, a skilled diplomat, to the imperial court at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. The transfer of the Palatinate Electorate from a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> (Frederick V) to a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> was of great consequence, since it secured a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> majority in the supreme council of the empire. Out of gratitude to Pope Gregory XV, Maximilian presented him with the Palatinate <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of Heidelberg, containing about 3500 <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Early in 1623 Gregory XV sent the Greek <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> <a href="01317b.htm">Leo Allatius</a> to transport the valuable collection to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where it was put up as the "Gregoriana" in the Vatican Library. Thirty-nine of these <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, which had come to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1797, were returned to Heidelberg at the Peace of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1815, and <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> returned 852 others as a gift in 1816.</p>

<p>The relations between <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman See</a> assumed a more friendly character during the pontificate of Gregory XV. For a time it seemed probable that, through the intended marriage of the Prince of <a href="15532a.htm">Wales</a> (afterwards King Charles I) with the Spanish Infanta Maria, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> could be restored in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Though the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> favored the marriage, it never took place. The treatment, however, of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects of James I became more tolerable and, to some extent at least, they enjoyed religious liberty. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the power of the <a href="07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> was on the decrease, owing to the influence of Gregory XV with King Louis XIII. Here the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> converted large numbers of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. Even in the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, that stronghold of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reaction set in, despite the fact that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and expelled from the country.</p>

<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers respected the authority of Gregory XV, not only in religious affairs, but also in matters of a purely political nature. This was noticeable when an international dispute arose concerning the possession of the Valtelline (1620) the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> occupied that district, while the Austrians took possession of the Grisons passes and were in close proximity to the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. The proximity of the two allied armies endangered the interests of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. These three powers, therefore, combined to compel the Austrians and <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> to evacuate the Valtelline, by force of arms if <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Upon request, Pope Gregory XV intervened by sending his brother Orazio at the head of the pontifical troops to take temporary possession of the Valtelline. After a little reluctance on the part of Archduke Leopold of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, the disputed territory with its fortresses was yielded to Orazio, and the impending <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> was thus averted.</p>
