<p>The word <em>age</em>, taken in its widest meaning, may be described as "a period of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>". The geologist, physiologist, and jurist define it differently, each from his own viewpoint. Jurists define it as "that period of life at which the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> allows <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> to do acts and discharge functions which, for want of years, they were prohibited from doing or undertaking before" (Bouvier's Law Dict.). They divide the years of a man into seven ages, to wit: infancy, from the day of birth, not <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> (Sacr. Congr. Conc., 4 December, 1627), to the seventh year; childhood, 7-14; puberty, 14-25; majority (young manhood), 25-40; manhood, 40-50 or 60; old age, 60-70; decrepitude, 70-100, or death. The terminal year in each of the above ages must be complete. Canonical age is the year. fixed by the canons, or law of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, at which her subjects become capable of incurring certain <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a>, enjoying special privileges, embracing special states of life, holding office or dignity, or receiving the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Each and every one of these, being a <a href="01115a.htm">human act</a>, requires a development of mind and body proportioned to the free and <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acceptance of these gifts and privileges, also an adequate <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of, and capability for, the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> attached. Hence the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> prescribes that age at which one is generally supposed to have the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> qualifications. It is evident that a lesser development of body and mind is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the reception of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> than is required for either matrimony or the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and greater qualifications for the higher than for the lower offices. Hence, the canonical age necessarily varies as do the privileges, offices, dignities, etc. The three states, <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, religious, and laic, embrace all the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> enactments concerning age.</p>

<h2>Ante-Tridentine discipline</h2>

<h3>Ecclesiastical state</h3>

<p>The ancient <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> was neither universal nor fixed, but varied with circumstances of time and locality. The requisite age, according to Gratian, for <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and the first three <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, i.e. <a href="12284b.htm">doorkeeper</a>, reader, and <a href="05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, was seven and for <a href="01106a.htm">acolyte</a>, twelve years complete. The present age for <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a> is seven full years (Cap. 4, de romp. ordin. in sexto; <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "Inter sollicitos", &#167; 9-1795). Subdeaconship called for the attainment of the twentieth year (<a href="04311b.htm">Conc. Trullanum</a>, 692; Conc. Rothomag., 1074). <a href="04647c.htm">Deaconship</a> required the thirtieth year complete, according to <a href="14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (385 Orig. text C. 3, Dist. 77); twenty-five full years according to various councils, including that of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1056); and the twentieth year inchoate according to <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (1305-16). For <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, although <a href="14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (lot. cit.) demanded thirty-five years, the general <a href="05030a.htm">discipline</a> up to the Lateran Council exacted only thirty full years. Dispensations from that age were frequently granted, owing to the great need for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> from the eighth century onward. The aforesaid Lateran Council fixed the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> age for a <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> at the twenty-fifth year inchoate, which <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (loc. cit.) finally confirmed. The episcopate was not conferred until the completion of the forty-fifth year, according to <a href="14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (lot. cit.). Various councils fixed the Episcopal age at thirty years complete.</p>

<h2>Tridentine discipline</h2>

<p>The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. xxiii, cap. 4, de Reform.) fixed no certain age for <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a>; yet the qualifications specified by it for <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a> indicate seven years for the former, and a more advanced age than seven for the latter, which, however, may be licitly received before the fourteenth year (ibid., c. 4).</p>

<h3>Major orders</h3>

<p>The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. xxiii, cap. 12) fixed the age of twenty-two for Subdeaconship, twenty-three for <a href="04647c.htm">Deaconship</a>, and twenty-five for the Priesthood, The first day of the year prescribed suffices for the reception of the Order. <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> (Sess. vii, c. 1, de reform.) confirmed the Lateran age of thirty full years for the episcopate. The age for <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> (even <a href="03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacons</a>) was fixed by the Council (Sess. xxiv, de reform, cap. 1) at thirty years complete. <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, however, made the twenty-second year inchoate age sufficient for <a href="03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacons</a>, provided that within a year he can be, and is, <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a>, under penalty of loss of active and passive vote in all consistories, and even in the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> for the election of a pope.</p>

<h3>Papacy</h3>

<p>No certain age is fixed by law for election to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. History records the election of some very young <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. <a href="08426a.htm">John XI</a> was scarcely twenty-three (Fuga), or twenty-four (according to Berninus), and <a href="08426b.htm">John XII</a> was not twenty-two. But they were exceptions. The exalted position and important <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> attached to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> require qualifications greater than those <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> even for the episcopate. Consequently, a mature age is desired.</p>

<p>Dispensation from the canonical, age is a relaxation of the canon law; hence the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> alone can dispense. He rarely does so in the case of age requisite for <a href="14320a.htm">subdeaconship</a> or <a href="04647c.htm">deaconship</a>. But on account of recent military <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> in certain <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> countries, he has dispensed with the age prescribed for candidates for Subdeaconship. Though a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a> who has not completed his thirtieth year cannot be <a href="05374b.htm">elected</a>; he can be <a href="12319c.htm">postulated</a> for as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The Holy Father ordinarily refuses unless the cleric is fully twenty-seven years old. Bishops in countries subject to the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> (e.g. Great Britain, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>,: Australia, <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>, and the Orient) have fatalities (Formula; I, art. 3) to dispense (a) with twelve months in the case of candidates for <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, whether they are yet in: orders or not. This applies to regular as well as secular candidates. (Holy Office, 29 January, 1896); (b) with fourteen months in the case of <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, also regular and secular candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (Formula C, art. 3; etc.). The <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are empowered: (Formula T, art. 1) to dispense with eighteen months in case of fifteen <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> (regular and secular) about to be <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. These <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> do not apply to candidates for <a href="14320a.htm">subdeaconship</a> or <a href="04647c.htm">deaconship</a>. Though the censures to be incurred by the violators of the canonical ages, according to ancient law and the constitution of <a href="12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, have been abrogated (see <a href="01645a.htm">APOSTOLIC&AElig; SEDIS</a>), nevertheless the vindictive punishments, i.e. prohibition to exercise the order received and privation of <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> annexed, still remain in full force (Santi, I, 120, n. 10; Wernz., Jus Decret., II, 148).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Benefices</h2>

<p>No special age was fixed by ancient canons for collation of a simple <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>, i.e. without any <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> attached. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> required the fourteenth year inchoate, but it said nothing about the age for <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> whose foundation permitted a lesser age. For such seven years sufficed. The same age was sufficient in the case of canons upon whom collectively, not singly, the <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> devolved, as also of recipients of <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> half-portions and pensions arising from <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Canons of collegiate churches whose <a href="12371a.htm">prebend</a> neither by foundations nor by custom demanded Sacred Orders in its incumbent, were required to be fourteen years old. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> did not change this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. Dignitaries of <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and collegiate churches with <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> attached should have attained their twenty-fifth year. (Cone. Trid., Sess. xxiv, cap. 12). The age of twenty-three years complete for <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, as fixed by the <a href="04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> (cap. 14, de elect. in sexto), still holds; the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> made no innovation in this matter. The <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a> age of fourteen years for <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and collegiate dignitaries without <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> was changed to twenty-two years complete, by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, de reform, cap. 12, &#167; ad caeteras). A <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> must be twenty-five, and a penitentiary, or <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> confessor, forty years inchoate. For <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons there was no fixed <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a> age. <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, however, decreed that canons not having at least <a href="14320a.htm">subdeaconship</a> should have no vote in the chapter, and those possessing a <a href="12371a.htm">prebend</a> to which a major order was affixed should receive that order within a year, under forfeiture of half the daily distributions and of a vote in chapter. <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> decreed that every <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="12371a.htm">prebend</a> should have attached to it one of the three major orders, which must be received within a year from election to the office of canon. It advised all <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to make division of the <a href="03252a.htm">canonries</a>, so that the one half should be presbyteral and the other half diaconal and <a href="14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a>. Hence, for a <a href="14320a.htm">subdiaconal</a> <a href="12371a.htm">prebend</a> twenty years complete, for a diaconal twenty-one years complete, and for a presbyteral twenty-three years complete sufficed. Where the <a href="15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> division was not introduced the Clementine law qualifying the fourteen years holds. Collation of a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> or <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office, without <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, upon a candidate who lacks even one day of the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> age, is invalid.</p>

<h2>Religious state</h2>

<p>Generals, <a href="12514b.htm">provincials</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and other regular <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> having quasi-Episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> must, according to many, have completed their thirtieth year before election (Ferraris, Wernz, et al.); according to others, the twenty-fifth year inchoate: will suffice (Plat, Vermeersch, and Ferrari). The various orders and congregations, however, have their peculiar rules as to the requisite age for inferior offices and dignities in their respective organizations. The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. xxv, cap. 7, de regular. et monial.) fixed forty years complete and eight years after her profession for an <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>, mother general, or <a href="12428a.htm">prioress</a> of any <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Could no such one be found in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>; then a <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a> over thirty years old and more than five years a professed, can be elected. An election contrary to these rules is invalid. For clothing with the religious habit or entrance into the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> no special age was fixed by <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a> law. <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> (Cure ad Regularem, 19 March, 1603) decreed that the constitution of each community should be the guide. He directed, however, that <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and lay sisters should not be admitted before their twentieth year. The Sacred Congregation of the Council (16 July, 1632; 7 April, 1634) forbade the reception of <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a> until they attained their fifteenth year. The Congregation of Bishops and Regulars (23 May, 1659) prohibited the clothing with the habit before the completion of the fifteenth year. The same Congregation (Normae de Novis Institutis, 28 June, 1901) decreed that no one could be admitted under fifteen, or over thirty, years of age without <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. For <a href="12451b.htm">religious profession</a> the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. xxv, cap. 15) exacted sixteen years complete with one year's <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> necessarily preceding. The latest enactment, prescribing simple Vows for three continuous years after the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> before solemn profession, fixes the age for solemn profession at nineteen years complete. This applies to <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> (Congr. of Bishops and Regulars, 3 May, 1902) as well as to men. It is forbidden to postpone the solemn profession of men, who have been under simple <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> for three, years, beyond the full twenty-fifth year of their age, except in some localities and institutes, e.g. the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, in which the profession of simple <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> is continued for a much longer term of years than three.</p>

<h2>Ordinary Christian life</h2>

<p>No certain age is fixed for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; yet the Holy Office (30 July, 1771) forbids the postponement of infant <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> beyond the third day. According to early <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> confirmation and <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> were administered to infants after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>Today, twelve years is generally recommended for <a href="04215b.htm">confirmation</a>; but, if urgent reasons exist for not awaiting that age, it is expedient not to confirm before the age of reason, i.e. seven years (<a href="13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a>; Holy Office, 11 December, 1850; Second Cone. Balt., V, c. iii, 252). <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> commended Robert, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, for introducing the <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> of confirming before <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> (22 June, 1897).</p>

<p>For confession the age is seven years, i.e. the age of reason, when a child is generally supposed to be capable of mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and bound by the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of annual confession [Conc. Lat., c. 21; Second Conc. Balt., tit. ix; First Plenary Conc. of S. America (Rome, 1899), tit. V, cap. 4].</p>

<p>Children should receive <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> when they have attained the age of discretion (<a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in Conc. Lat., c. 21). There is much controversy as to what that age precisely is. According to some, it ordinarily occurs between the tenth and fourteenth year (<a href="14319a.htm">Suarez</a>, quoted by <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "Syn. Dioc., " VII, xii, 3; Raimundi, "Inst. Past., " tit. I, cap. iv, n. 57; Zitelli, Apparatus Jur. Pont. p. 319, no. 4; Second Plen. Conc. Balt., tit. V). Others, e.g. <a href="06048a.htm">Ferraris</a> (I, 154, n. 39), place it between eleven and twelve years. Children in danger of death, capable of committing and making confession of mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of distinguishing the heavenly from the ordinary food, and desiring to receive <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, must not be denied it, although they may not have reached the minimum year mentioned (<a href="13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a>, de Euch., n. 63; Second Plen. Conc. Balt., and First Plen. Conc. of South America, loc. cit.).</p>

<p>Extreme unction is to be administered to a child of seven years or younger, capable of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>Children of seven years complete are bound by the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of abstinence and of hearing <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>. They can also be sponsors in the conferring of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> and confirmation; but the <a href="13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> (tit. II, n. 24) says that it is more expedient that they should be fourteen years old and also confirmed. The Congregations of <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (4 May, 1774) and the Holy Office (1 July, 1882) forbid children under fourteen years of age to act as sponsors at confirmation. Only those who have completed their twenty-first year are bound to fast.</p>

<p>Betrothals [<em>sponsalia</em>] require seven full years in the contracting parties. The marriageable age is fourteen full years in males and twelve full years in <a href="15687b.htm">females</a>, under penalty of nullity (unless natural puberty supplies the want of years). Marriages void because of the absence of legal or natural puberty are held as <em>sponsalia</em>, inducing thereby impediment of "public decorum" (Cap. 14, tit. de despon. impub., X, 4, 2). Civil codes generally require a more advanced age than the canonical. Dispensations, however, as to the required ages are expressly granted by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, Roumania, and <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The marriageable age in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and Roumania is eighteen for men, and fifteen for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> (France requires also, under penalty of nullity, the consent of <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>); <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> (Caucasian Provinces excepted), fifteen and thirteen; and <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> fixes the age at eighteen and sixteen; <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, fourteen for both parties; <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, twenty and sixteen; <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, twenty-one (minors set free by <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> at eighteen) and sixteen years respectively. Marriages contracted in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> below the ages aforesaid are valid but illicit. In <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> natives marry under canonical age. So also in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, where there is a further deviation from canonical age, owing to the Chinese method of reckoning age by lunar rather than solar years (thirteen lunar months make a solar year). The canonical age holds in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, Greece (Ionian Isles excepted, where it is sixteen and fourteen), and as regards <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> even in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. While in some parts of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the canonical marriage age of fourteen and twelve still prevails, in others it has been enlarged by <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>. Such <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a>, however, as a rule, do not make void marriages contracted by a male and <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> of fourteen and twelve years respectively, unless the statute expressly forbids them under penalty of nullity.</p>

<p>The <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="09068a.htm">Common Law</a> age of fourteen in males and twelve in <a href="15687b.htm">females</a> prevails in all the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> provinces, with the exception of <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a> and Manitoba. <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a> requires fourteen years, and Manitoba sixteen years, in both parties. Marriages contracted at more youthful ages than these are not irreparably null and void. They can be, and are, ratified by continued cohabitation after the prescribed age. In all the provinces consent of <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> or guardians is required where one or both of the parties have not attained a certain age &#151; <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, <a href="09602a.htm">Manitoba</a>, and New Brunswick, eighteen years; in Qu&eacute;bec, <a href="11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, <a href="02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, Prince Edward Island, <a href="13482b.htm">Alberta</a>, and Saskatchewan the age is twenty-one. Except in the case of Qu&eacute;bec and Prince Edward Island such consent is only directory, and does not affect the validity of marriage after celebration. Such marriages in the former province are not void, and can only be attacked by parties whose consent is required; in the latter province they are null and void by virtue of a pre-confederation law of 1831.</p>

<p>The marriage law in nearly every part of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> requires the consent of <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> before license is granted to minors. Such <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> are merely directive, and do not render void marriages without the <a href="11478c.htm">parents'</a> consent ("Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law," art. "Marriage", 1191). Neither in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> is a marriage declared void for want of <a href="11478c.htm">parental</a> consent (Brown, Hast. Matr. Inst., II, 191).</p>
