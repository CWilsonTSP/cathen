<p>This <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> originated in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the fourth century and was derived from the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>-<a href="09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> doctrines taught by Marcus, an <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> from <a href="10176a.htm">Memphis</a>.</p>

<p>His first adherents were a lady named Agape and a rhetorician named Helpidius, through whose influence Priscillian "a man of noble birth, of great <a href="15571a.htm">riches</a>, bold, restless, eloquent, learned through much reading, very ready at debate and discussion (<a href="14332a.htm">Sulpicius Severus</a>, "His. Sac.", II, 46) was also enrolled. His high position and great gifts made him the leader of the party and he became an ardent apostle of the new doctrines. Through his oratorical gifts and reputation for extreme <a href="01767c.htm">asceticism</a> he attracted a large following. Among those drawn to him were two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Instantius and Salvianus. The adherents of the new <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> organized themselves into an oath-bound <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> the rapid spread of which attracted the attention of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04359b.htm">Cordova</a>, Hyginus, who made known his <a href="06021a.htm">fears</a> to Idacius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Emeritu, and, at the instance of the latter and of Ithacius of Ossanova, a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> was held at Saragossa in 380. <a href="02581b.htm">Bishops</a> were present at this <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> not only from <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> but from Aquitaine. Though summoned, the Priscillianists refused to appear, and the <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> pronounced <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the four leaders, Instantius, Salvianus, Helpidius, and Priscillian.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The enforcement of the synod's <a href="04670a.htm">decrees</a> was committed to Ithacius, an impulsive and <a href="15446a.htm">violent</a> man. He failed to bring the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> to terms, and, in defiance, Priscillian was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="02160b.htm">Avila</a>. Idacius and Ithacius <a href="01652a.htm">appealed</a> to the imperial authorities. The <a href="06729c.htm">Emperor Gratian</a> issued a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> which not only deprived the Priscillianists of the churches into which they had <a href="08082a.htm">intruded</a> themselves but <a href="13720b.htm">sentenced</a> Priscillian and his followers to exile. Instantius, Salvianus, and Priscillian proceeded to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to gain the aid of <a href="04614a.htm">Pope Damasus</a> in having this <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> <a href="13007a.htm">revoked</a>. Denied an <a href="02069a.htm">audience</a>, they went to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> to make a similar request of <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, but with the same result. They then resorted to intrigue and <a href="02778c.htm">bribery</a> at the Court with such success that they were not only freed from the <a href="13720b.htm">sentence</a> of exile, but permitted to regain possession of their churches in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where, under the patronage of the imperial officials, they enjoyed such power as to compel Ithacius to withdraw from the country. He, in turn, <a href="01652a.htm">appealed</a> to <a href="06729c.htm">Gratian</a>, but before anything had been accomplished the emperor was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the usurper Maximus had taken his place.</p>

<p>Maximus, wishing to curry favour with the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party and to replenish his treasury through confiscations, gave orders for a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a>, which was held in <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> in 384. Instantius was first tried and condemned to <a href="04737b.htm">deposition</a>. Thereupon Priscillian <a href="01652a.htm">appealed</a> to the emperor at <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Ithacius acted as his accuser and was so vehement in his <a href="04733b.htm">denunciations</a> that <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, who was then in <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>, intervened, and, after expressing his disapproval of bringing an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> case before a civil tribunal, obtained from the emperor a promise not to carry his condemnation to the extent of shedding blood. After <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin</a> had left the city, the emperor appointed the Prefect Evodius as judge. He found Priscillian and some others guilty of the crime of magic. This decision was reported to the emperor who put Priscillian and several of his followers to the sword; the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of others was confiscated and they were banished.</p>

<p>The conduct of Ithacius immediately met with the severest reprobation. <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin</a>, hearing what had taken place, returned to <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> and compelled the emperor to rescind an order to the military tribunes, already on their way to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> to extirpate the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. There is no ground in the condemnation and death of Priscillian for the charge made against the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of having invoked the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authority</a> to punish <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> censured not only the actions of Ithacius but also that of the emperor. <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> was equally stern in his <a href="04733b.htm">denunciation</a> of the case and some of the Gallican <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were in <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a> under the leadership of Theognistus, broke off communion with Ithacius, who was subsequently <a href="04737b.htm">deposed</a> from his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> by a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> of <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and his friend and abettor Idatius, was compelled to resign.</p>

<p>The death of Priscillian and his followers had an unlooked for sequel. The numbers and <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> increased; those who were executed were <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> as <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The progress and spread of the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> called for fresh measures of repression. In 400 a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> was held in Toledo at which many among them two <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Symphonius and Dictinnius were reconciled to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Dictinnius was the author of a book "Libra" (Scales), a <a href="10559a.htm">moral</a> treatise from the Priscillianist viewpoint. The upheaval in the Spanish peninsula consequent on the invasion of the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandals</a> and the Suevi aided the spread of Priscillianism. So menacing was this revival that <a href="11322a.htm">Orosius</a>, a <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, wrote to <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (415) to enlist his aid in combating the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Pope Leo at a later <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> took active steps for its repression and at his urgent insistence councils were held in 446 and 447 at <a href="02018d.htm">Astorga</a>, Toledo, and Galicia. In spite of these efforts the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> continued to spread during the fifth century. In the following century it commenced to decline, and after the <a href="02729a.htm">Synod of Braga</a>, held in 563, had legislated concerning it, it soon died out.</p>

<p>In regard to the doctrines and teaching of Priscillian and his <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, it is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to go into the <a href="10202b.htm">merits</a> of the discussion as to whether Priscillian was guilty of the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> traditionally ascribed to him, whether he was really a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>, or whether he was <a href="08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned &#151; the object of misunderstanding and reprobation even in his lifetime and afterwards made to bear the burden of <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions subsequently developed and associated with his name. The weight of evidence and the entire course of events in his lifetime make the supposition of his innocence extremely improbable. The discovery by Schepss of eleven treatises from his pen in a fifth or sixth-century <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, in the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="15720a.htm">University of W&uuml;rzburg</a>, has not put an end to a controversy still involved in considerable difficulty. Kunstle (Antipriscilliana), who has examined all the testimony, has decided in favour of the traditional view, which alone seems capable of offering any adequate solution of the fact that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Aquitaine was aroused to activity by the <a href="13529a.htm">separatist</a> tendency in the Priscillianist movement.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The foundation of the doctrines of the Priscillianists was <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>-<a href="09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> <a href="05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, a <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="05543b.htm">existence</a> of two kingdoms, one of Light and one of Darkness. <a href="01476d.htm">Angels</a> and the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="09580c.htm">men</a> were said to be severed from the <a href="14322c.htm">substance</a> of the <a href="04683a.htm">Deity</a>. Human <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> were intended to conquer the Kingdom of Darkness, but fell and were imprisoned in material bodies. Thus both kingdoms were represented in <a href="09580c.htm">man</a>, and hence a conflict symbolized on the side of Light by the Twelve Patriarchs, <a href="07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="14220b.htm">spirits</a>, who corresponded to certain of <a href="09580c.htm">man's</a> powers, and, on the side of Darkness, by the Signs of the Zodiac, the symbols of <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and the lower kingdom. The <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="09580c.htm">man</a> consists in liberation from the domination of <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a>. The twelve <a href="07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="14220b.htm">spirits</a> having failed to accomplish their release, the <a href="08374c.htm">Saviour</a> came in a <a href="07170a.htm">heavenly</a> body which appeared to be like that of other men, and through His <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and His apparent death released the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the men from the influence of the material.</p>

<p>These doctrines could be harmonized with the teaching of <a href="13635b.htm">Scripture</a> only by a strange system of <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, in which the literal sense was entirely rejected, and an equally strange theory of personal inspiration. The <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was received, but the narrative of <a href="04470a.htm">creation</a> was rejected. Several of the <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal Scriptures</a> were acknowledged to be genuine and <a href="08045a.htm">inspired</a>. The <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> side of the <a href="05169a.htm">Dualism</a> of Priscillian with its low concept of <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> gave rise to an indecent system of <a href="01767c.htm">asceticism</a> as well as to some peculiar <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> observances, such as <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and on <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>. Because their doctrines were esoteric and exoteric, and because it was <a href="02408b.htm">believed</a> that men in general could not understand the higher paths, the Priscillianists, or at least those of them who were enlightened, were permitted to tell lies for the sake of a <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> end. It was because this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was likely to be a <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> even to the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> that Augustine wrote his famous work, <a href="../fathers/1312.htm">"De mendacio"</a>.</p>
