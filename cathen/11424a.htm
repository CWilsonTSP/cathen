<p>First <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> sent by Pope Celestine to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (431). The chronicle of the contemporary <a href="12487a.htm">St. Prosper of Aquitaine</a> present two import entries relating to <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>. Under date of 429 it has, "Agricola, a <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian</a>, son of Severianus, a <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, corrupted the churches of Britain by the insinuation of his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; but at the insistence of the Deacon <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> (<em>ad actionem Palladii Diaconi</em>), Celestine sends Germanus, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Auxerre as his representative to root out <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> and direct the Britons to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>". Again under the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of 431, in the consulship of Bassus and Antiocus: "Palladius was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Pope Celestine and sent to the Scots <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> in Christ, as their first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>" (Ad Scotum in Christum credentes ordinatur a Papa Celestino <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> et primus episcopus mittitur). In his work against Cassian, St. Prosper compendiates both entries: "Wherefore the Pontiff Celestine of venerable memory, to whom the Lord gave many gifts for safeguarding the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, knowing that for those who are already condemned, the remedy to be applied is not a further judicial inquiry but only repentance, gave instructions for Celestius, who asked for a further hearing in a matter already settled, to be driven from the borders of all <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> . . . with no less jealous care he delivered Britain from the same disease, when he drove even from that hidden recess of the ocean some enemies of Grace who were settling in their native soil; and by ordaining a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> (<em>Scotis</em>), whilst he laboured to keep the Roman Island <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, he made also the barbarous Island <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>." The words of the second entry to the chronicle, "to the Scots <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> in Christ" can only have the meaning that when the chronicle was being written in 447, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> had become a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> people.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Some writers with Dr. Todd regard <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> as <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="06484a.htm">St. Germanus</a>, but it appears more probable that he held the high rank of Deacon of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; it can hardly be supposed that a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Auxerre would exercise such influence in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as that assigned to <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, and it is in accordance with St. Prosper's usage to indicate the Roman <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> by the simple title <em>diaconus</em>. Thus in the chronicle we have frequent entries such as "Hilarius Diaconus", "Ioannes Diaconus", "Leo Diaconus", which invariably refer to the <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The seventh century life of <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> by Muircu Maccumachthenus in the "Book of Armaugh" expressly styles <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> "Archidiaconus Pap&aelig; Coelestini urbis Rom&aelig; Episcopi", repeated in several of the other lives of <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. Usshers registers the tradition long current in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> that <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> was born in Britain and that he had combatted the <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagian heresy</a> there. The <a href="02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> are also of the opinion that he was "a Briton by birth". The Palladii, however, were reckoned among the noblest <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and several of them held high rank about this time in the <a href="06395b.htm">Church of Gaul</a>. These conflicting opinions may perhaps be reconciled. Under <a href="08558b.htm">Julius the Apostate</a> there was a <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> holding prominent rank in the army of Gaul, who, for his fearless profession of the Faith, was exiled into Britain. We may easily suppose that the scion of such a privileged Gaulo-British <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> would attain the position of Deacon of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, would take much interest in the British Church, and, would by his familiarity with the Celtic language, be qualified to undertake the mission of the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>. <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> is <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the Scottish calendar on 6 July. The <a href="02777a.htm">Aberdeen Breviary</a> describes him as "pontificem et fidei Catholic&aelig; apostolum pariter et doctorem". In some ancient records he is styled a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a>, probably because of the hardships endured during his missionary career in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Palladius landed in the territory of the Hy-Garchon, on the strand where the town of Wicklow now stands, then occupied by the tribe of Cualann who have left their name on the beautiful valley of Glencullen, seven miles distant from the spot where <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> landed. The chieftain of the district had no welcome for the missionaries. However, some of the tribe appear to have extended a better measure of kindness to them and at least three churches were in after times assigned as a result of <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius's</a> mission. The Life of St. Patrick, already referred to, records the failure of the mission: "Palladius was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> and sent to covert this land lying under wintry cold, but <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> hindered him, for no man can receive anything from earth unless it be given to him from <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>; and neither did those fierce and cruel men receive his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> readily, nor did he himself wish to spend time in a strange land, but returned to him who sent him. On his return hence, however, having crossed the first sea and commenced his land journey, he died in the territory of the Britons." In the Scholia on St. Fiace's Hymn in the ancient "Liber Hymnorum", it is stated that in the country of the Hy-Garchon, <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> "founded some churches: <em>Teach-na-Roman</em>, or the House of the Romans, <em>Kill-Fine</em>, and others. Nevertheless he was not well received, but was forced to go round the coast of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> towards the north, until driven by a tempest he reached the extreme part of Mohaidh towards the south, where he founded the church of Fordun, and <em>Pledi</em> is his name there." The <em>Vita Secunda</em>, Life of St. Patrick in <a href="04099c.htm">Colgan's</a> collection, adds further interesting details: "The most blessed Pope Celestine <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> Bishop the <a href="01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, named <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, and sent him to the Island of Hibernia, after having committed to him the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of Blessed Peter and Paul and other Saints, and having also given him the volumes of the Old and <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, entering the land of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>, arrived at the territory of the men of Leinster where Nathi Mac Garchon was chief, who was opposed to him. Others, however, whom the Divine mercy had disposed toward the worship of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, having been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the sacred Trinity, the blessed <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> built three churches in the same district; one, which is called <em>Cellfine</em>, in which even to the present day, he left his books which he had received from St. Celestine, and the box of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of blessed Peter and Paul and other Saints, and the tablets on which he used to write, which in the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> language are called from his name Pallere, that is, the burden of <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, and are held in veneration. Another, <em>Tech-na-Roman</em>, and the third, <em>Domnach Arcdec</em>, in which are buried the holy men of the companions of <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, Sylvester and Sallonius, who are <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> there. After a short time <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> died in the plain of Girgin in a place which is now called Fordun. but others say that he was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> with <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> there." Another ancient document, known as the <em>Vita Quinta</em> in <a href="04099c.htm">Colgan's</a> work, repeats the particulars given here relating to the foundation of three churches, and adds: "But St. Palladius, seeing that he could not do much good there, wishing to return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, migrated to the Lord in the region of the Picts. Others, however, say that he was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> with <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>."</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The three churches have been identified. <em>Teach-na-Roman</em> is Tigroney, where are the ruins of an old church in the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Castle Mac Adam in the county of Wicklow. <em>Kill-Fine</em> was supposed by Father Shearman to be the same as Killeen Cormac, a remarkable old churchyard, three miles southwest of Dunlavin, but more probably situated in the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Glendalough, in the townland which the Ordnance Survey has named Lara-West, but which is still called Killfinn by the people. The third church <em>Domnec Ardec</em> is Donard which gives its name to a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> and village in the west of the County Wicklow in the barony of Lower Talbotstown. This <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, as Father Shearman writes, retains "some vestiges of its ancient importance: the sites of primeval <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches, large and well-preserved Raths and Timuli, Cromlechs, Ogham Pillars, ancient <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Cahels, <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> Cathairs on the surrounding hills, with many other evidences of a civilized and numerous population". The modern critical Scottish historians, Bishop Forbes, Skein, and others, confess that in regard to the connection of St. Palladius with <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> documents are the only reliable sources. The traditions set forth in Fordun's chronicle and later writings are regarded as purely mythical. One assigns to <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> an apostolate in <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a> of twenty-three years; another makes him the tutor of St. Sevanus, contemporary of <a href="01135c.htm">St. Adamnan</a>, and Brude, king of the Picts (A.D. 697-706), all of which is irreconcilable with the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> narratives and with the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> mission from St. Celestine. A German theory has found favour with some writers in recent times, to the effect that the Bishop <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> referred to in the second entry by Prosper as sent to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> by Celestine was none other than <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. This theory viewed independently of the ancient historical narratives would have much to commend it. It would merely imply that the Bishop <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> of the second entry in the chronicle was distinct from the Deacon <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> of the first entry, and that the scanty records connected with <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius's</a> mission to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were to be referred to <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. But this theory is inconsistent with the unbroken series of testimonies in the ancient lives of <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> and cannot easily be reconciled with the traditions of the Scottish Church.</p>
