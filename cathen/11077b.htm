<p><a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (1652-1658; d. 1681). He was of peasant origin, born in the district of Nishni-Novgorod in 1605, and in early life was known as Nikita. <a href="05295b.htm">Educated</a> in a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, he married, became a <a href="13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, and for a time had a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> in <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. After ten years of married life, his children having died, he persuaded his wife to become a <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a> and he entered the Solovetski <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the White Sea, according to Orthodox custom, changing his name to Nikon. In accordance also with a common custom he next became a <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> on an island near by, dependent on the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. But a disagreement about the alleged misuse of some <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to break with the Solovetski <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and join the Kojeozerski community in the same neighbourhood, of which he became hegumen in 1643. Later he made a great impression on the emperor, Alexis, who made him Archimandrite of the Novospaski Laura at <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in 1646, and in 1649 <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Novgorod. Here he founded almshouses, distinguished himself by his many <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, and succeeded in putting down a dangerous revolt in 1650. Meanwhile he was in constant correspondence with the Tsar, at whose court he spent part of each year. Already during this time he began to prepare for a revision of the Slavonic Bible and Service books. In 1652 the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a> died and Nikon was appointed his successor.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As head of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> Nikon set about many important reforms. One of the first questions that engaged his attention was the reunion of the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> (Little Russians) with the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. When <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> held Little <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the Synod of Brest (1596) had brought about union between its inhabitants and <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Under Alexis, however, the tide turned; many <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> arose against <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and united with <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> (1653). A result of this was that the Russians were able without much difficulty to undo the work of the Synod of Brest, and to bring the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kief with the majority of his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> back to the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. This greatly increased the extent of the Russian patriarch's <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Nikon was able to entitle himself patriarch of Great, Little, and White Russia. During the reign of Alexis, Nikon built three <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, one of which, made after the model of the Anastasis and called "New Jerusalem," is numbered among the famous Lauras of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>.</p>

<p>The chief event of Nikon's reign was the reform of the service books. The Bible and books used in church in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> are translated from Greek into old Slavonic. But gradually many mistranslations and corruptions of the text had crept in. There were also details of ritual in which the Russian Church had forsaken the custom of Constantinople. Nikon's work was to restore all these points to exact conformity with the Greek original. This reform had been discussed before his time. In the sixteenth century the Greeks had reproached the Russians for their alterations, but a Russian synod in 1551 had sanctioned them. In Nikon's time there was more intercourse with Greeks than ever before, and in this way he conceived the necessity of restoring purer forms. While <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Novgorod he caused a committee of scholars to discuss the question, in spite of the patriarch Joseph. In 1650 a Russian <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> was sent to Constantinople to inquire about various <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> points. One detail that made much trouble was that the Russians had learned to make the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> with two fingers instead of three, as the Greeks did. As soon as he became patriarch, Nikon published an order introducing some of these reforms, which immediately called forth angry opposition. In 1654 and 1655 he summoned Synods which continued the work. Makarios, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, who came to <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> at that time was able to help, and there was continual correspondence with the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. At last, with the approval of the Greek <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, Nikon published the reformed service books and made <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> insisting on conformity with Greek custom in all points of ritual (1655-1658). A new Synod in 1656 confirmed this, <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> every one who made the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> except with three fingers, and forbade the rebaptizing of Latin converts (still a peculiarity of the Russian Church). This aroused a strong party of opposition. The patriarch was accused of anti- national sentiments, of trying to Hellenize the Russian Church, of corrupting the old <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. Nikon's strong will would have crushed the opposition, had he not, in some way not yet clearly explained, fallen foul of the tsar. It is generally said that part of his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of reform was to secure that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> should be independent of the state and that this aroused the tsar's <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a>. In any case in the year 1658 Nikon suddenly fell. He offered his resignation to the tsar and it was accepted. He had often threatened to resign before; it seems that this time, too, he did not mean his offer to be taken seriously. However, he had to retire and went to his New Jerusalem <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. A personal interview with Alexis was refused. The <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> remained <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> and Nikon, in spite of his resignation, attempted to regain his former place. Meanwhile the opposition to him became stronger. It was led by a Greek, Paisios Ligarides, <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="06399c.htm">Gaza</a> (unlawfully absent from his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>), who insisted on the appointment of a successor at <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. All Nikon's friends seem to have forsaken him at this juncture. Ligarides caused an appeal to be made to the Greek <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and their verdict was against Nikon. In 1664 he tried to force the situation by appearing suddenly in the patriarchal church at <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and occupying his place as if nothing had happened. But he did not succeed, and in 1667 a great synod was summoned to try him. The Patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch came to <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> expressly for this synod; a great number of Russian and Greek <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> sat as judges. The tsar himself appeared as accuser of his former friend. Nikon was summoned and appeared before the synod in his patriarch's robes. He was accused of neglecting his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> since 1658, of having betrayed his Church in a certain letter he had written to the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (in which he had complained of the Russian <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>), of harsh and <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> conduct in his treatment of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Nikon defended himself ably; the synod lasted a week; but at last in its eighth session it declared him deposed from the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, suspended from all offices but those of a simple <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, and sentenced him to confinement in a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> (Therapontof) on the White Sea. The <a href="01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> of the Trinity Laura at <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, Joasaph, was elected his successor (Joasaph II, 1667-72). Joasaph confirmed Nikon's reform of the Service books and rites. The party that opposed it formed the beginning of the Russian dissenting <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> (the <a href="12648b.htm">Raskolniks</a>).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>For a time Nikon's <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> was very severe. In 1675 he was taken to another <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> (of St. Cyril) and his treatment was lightened. Alexis towards the end of his life repented of his harsh treatment of the former patriarch, and from his death-bed (1767) sent to ask his forgiveness. The next tsar, Feodor II (1676-82) allowed him to return to his New Jerusalem <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. On the way thither Nikon died (17 August, 1681). He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> with the honours of a patriarch, and all decrees against him were revoked after his death. His <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> is in the Cathedral church of <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. Nikon's fall, the animosity of the tsar, and of the synod that deposed him remain mysterious. The cause was not his reform of the Service books, for that was maintained by his successor. It has been explained as a successful intrigue of his personal enemies at the court. He certainly had made enemies during his reign by his severity, his harsh manner, the uncompromising way he carried out his reforms regardless of the intensely conservative <a href="08050b.htm">instinct</a> of his people. Or, it has been said, Nikon brought about his disgrace by a premature attempt to free the Russian Church from the shackles of the state. His attitude represented an opposition to the growing Erastianism that culminated soon after his time in the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of Peter the Great (1689-1725). This is no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>. There are sufficient indications that Alexis' quarrel with Nikon was based on jealousy. Nikon wanted to be too independent of the tsar, and this independence was concerned, naturally, with <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. Some writers have thought that the root of the whole matter was that he became at the end of his reign a Latinizer, that he wanted to bring about reunion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and saw in that reunion the only safe protection for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> against the secular government. It has even been said that he <a href="04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (Gerebtzoff, "Essai", II, 514). The theory is not impossible. Since the Synod of Brest the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of reunion was in the air; Nikon had had much to do with <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>; he may at last have been partly convinced by them. And one of the accusations against him at his trial was that of Latinizing. A story is told of his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> by a <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a> worked by Saint Josaphat, the great <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the union. In any case the real reason of Nikon's fall remains one of the difficulties of Russian <a href="07365a.htm">Church history</a>. He was undoubtedly the greatest <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> has yet produced. A few <a href="14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works of no special importance were written by him.</p>
