<p>(VITERBIENSIS ET TUSCANENSIS).</p>

<p>The city of Viterbo in the Province of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> stands at the foot of Monte Cimino, in Central <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in an agricultural region. It has to a great degree preserved its <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> character, more particularly in its encircling walls, which are still in good preservation. The most ancient building in the city, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to <a href="09089a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, was altered in the twelfth and the sixteenth centuries. The capitals of the columns, the two monuments of <a href="08429c.htm">John XXI</a>, and some frescoes and framed pictures are worthy of note. On the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> square stands the episcopal palace, decorated with fine <a href="13641b.htm">sculpture</a> of the thirteenth century; here were held the <a href="04192a.htm">conclaves</a> of <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> (1271-73), <a href="08429c.htm">John XXI</a> (1276), and <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> (1282). The former <a href="09750a.htm">Servite</a> church of the Verit&egrave; is now a museum in which is preserved a fresco of Lorenzo da Viterbo representing the "Espousals of the Blessed Virgin". The adjoining <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> is occupied by the Technical Institute. In the Church of S. Francesco are a Madonna by <a href="12104b.htm">Sebastiano del Piombo</a>, and the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="01159a.htm">Adrian V</a>, by Vassalletto, and of <a href="04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>, by Pietro d'Oderiso. The Church of S. Sisto is remarkable for the great height of the sanctuary about the bulk of the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a>; in this church Henry, son of <a href="13045a.htm">Richard of Cornwall</a>, was slain by Simon and Guy de Montfort in 1271. S. Maria della Salute is remarkable for its graceful doorway. The Madonna della Quercia, with its annexed <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, is of elegant <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> architecture; in the lunette of the doorways of the <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> are examples of majolica by <a href="13095b.htm">Luca</a> and Agostino della Robbia. The richly gilded ceiling is by Antonio da Sangallo; the tabernacle by Andrea Bregno. In the Church of S. Rosa is preserved the mummified body of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>; on her <a href="06021b.htm">feast day</a> (4 September) her <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a>, enshrined in a large <em>tempietto</em> decorated with lanterns, is borne aloft by sixteen men. S. Maria dei Gradi, of which the church still remains, was one of the earliest <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and is even now a house of retreat. S. Juliana de Marescotti is buried in the Church of S. Maria della Pace.</p>

<p>Among illustrious Viterbans may be mentioned the Augustinian Blessed Giacomo of Viterbo (thirteenth century). Notable profane edifices are the Municipal Building, with its splendidly frescoed halls and important Etruscan, Roman, and <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> museum, the Rocca, and, among a number of private buildings, the arches of S. Pellegrino. The neighbourhood is rich in Etruscan and Roman remains. The public fountains are especially beautiful. Noteworthy are the burial-places of Castel d'Asso, Norchia, and Musarna, which have yielded a large number of Etruscan sarcophagi and inscriptions. Ferento, on the other hand, is rich in Roman remains, among them the theatre and temple of Fortuna. Viterbo is famous for its numerous and copious mineral springs, the chief of which is the little sulphur lake of Bulicame; other sulphur springs are those of Bagnaccio, Torretta, and Cruciata. The water of the Grotta spring is sub-acid.</p>

<p>There is much dispute as to the origin of the city of Viterbo. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that many <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Roman period are found in the district, and the baths of Bulicame (Aquae Caiae) and of Bacucco (Aquae Passeris) were unquestionably frequented both in the Roman and the Etruscan periods. It is not improbable that the city of Sorrina Nova stood here; others think that this may have been the site of Forum Subertanum. The name of Viterbo occurs for the first time in the eighth century, under the pontificate of Zachary, when it was a village tributary to Toscanella, in Lombardic <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> (Tuscia Langobardorum) on the Via Cassia. <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> gave the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> all this <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> territory in <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> tenure, the imperial authority over it being still represented by a sculdascio and later by a count. In the eleventh century the city had already grown very considerably, numbering thirteen churches, three of them with collegiate chapters. For its loyalty to him <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> granted it communal privileges. Paschal II was brought thither a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in 1111. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the city several times afforded the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> an asylum. In 1155 <a href="01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> here met <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, who, it is said, had to hold the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> stirrup. When <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> became a republic it endeavoured to subdue Viterbo, which, supported by <a href="06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, attached itself to his party, and sheltered the <a href="01582a.htm">antipopes</a> <a href="11515a.htm">Paschal III</a> and <a href="03187a.htm">Callistus III</a>. But the populace were faithful to <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, and only the nobility were <a href="07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a>, though after the peace between the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor they rebelled against the latter also.</p>

<p>The dominions of the city increased after this, many towns and villages placing themselves under its protection, while others were subdued by force. The neighbouring town of Ferento was completely destroyed (1172) because it represented Christ crucified with the eyes opened instead of closed. These conquests resulted in renewed friction with the Romans, who overcame the Viterbans (1201). War broke out again when Viterbo purchased Centocello (1220). As a result the victory of Viterbo (1234), the cities of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> were freed from allegiance to the Senate of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1207 <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> there held a parliament to establish a form of government for this province, which was called the Patrimony (more properly, the <em>Patrimonium Tusciae</em>), and of which Viterbo was then the capital. In the discord between the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> the city was <a href="07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a>; it refused to receive <a href="06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in 1232; in 1237, while the same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was at Viterbo, a <a href="07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> revolt broke out; and in 1240 the city received <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. In 1243 Raniero Capocci drove the Imperialists out of Viterbo. Frederick regained the city in 1247, after a siege lasting a year. On the death of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> it submitted to the temporal authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, after <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> had guaranteed its communal liberties.</p>

<p>At this period occurred the death of <a href="13193a.htm">St. Rose of Viterbo</a>, who, because she had preached against <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, had been exiled, with all her <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, a few days before the emperor's death was known, but had been permitted to return some months before her own death. Under <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> her body was buried in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Clarisses. In the subsequent period of tranquility the city extended its dominion over all the territory of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> north of Lake Bracciano and on the right bank of the Tiber. After the death of <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> at Viterbo (the exact whereabouts of his grave in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is unknown), the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> Court remained there for twenty years. <a href="15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>, <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, <a href="08429c.htm">John XXI</a>, <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, and <a href="09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> were elected there. In the last election the Viterbans attacked the two Orsini <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and threw them into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, on account of a dispute as to the possession of certain villages. The controversy between the Orsini and Viterbo was eventually settled by <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. About 1300 the communal government was reorganized; the power was placed in the hands of eight "reformers" and of a "defender of the people" without whose assent the assembly could not be convoked, nor any public matter discussed or expense incurred. This soon developed into despotism; after 1312 the office became hereditary in the <a href="07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Prefetti di Vico. From 1319 to 1329, however, Silvestro Gatti forcibly caused himself to be elected defender, and serious disorders ensued. In 1328 the city accorded a festive reception to Louis the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> and received a <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> from him very soon, however, it repented and received the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> with <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>. In 1329 Faziolo di Vico slew Gatti and made himself defender. Faziolo was in turn slain by his brother Giovanni, who lorded it over the whole Patrimony during the absence of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, but was driven out by Lando Gatti, a former <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>. Wars followed with the governor of the Patrimony, when the Viterbans refused to pay certain imposts (1346-50), and with Cola di Rienzi (1347), to whom the city surrendered.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>When Cardinal Albornoz came to effect the reconquest of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, Viterbo submitted and built a fortress (<em>Rocca</em>) for the governor of the Patrimony. In 1367, during the sojourn of <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a> at Viterbo, a quarrel between the populace and the retinue of one of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> developed into a general uprising, which the Viterban Cardinal Marco quickly put down. In 1375 Francesco di Vico took possession of the city, which joined in the general revolt against <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> rule, but quickly submitted. When the Schism arose, Vico's tyranny recommenced; he took the side of <a href="13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> and sustained a siege by Cardinal Orsini. The people rose against the tyrant and killed him (8 May, 1387), and Viterbo returned to the obedience or <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>. But in 1391 Gian Sciarra di Vico reentered the city and took possession of its government. In 1391 Cardinal Pileo, the <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>, would have given the city over to <a href="02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, but his plan failed, and he with difficulty saved himself by flight: Vico came to an understanding with <a href="02670a.htm">Boniface</a>.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the fifteenth century Viterbo and the Patrimony were incessantly objects of attack, now of Ladislaus of Naples, now of Braccio da Montone, now of the Sforza. Two of these having died, Giovanni Gatti made himself lord of Viterbo, endeavouring at the same time to maintain good relations with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who still kept a governor of the Patrimony there. His son Princivalle was killed at the instigation of the Mondaleschi (1454), and a like fate befell Guglielmo Gatti (1456). There followed a series of fights between the Gatteschi and Maganzesi factions, especially in 1496, leading to the extinction of the Gatti domination. Peace was not re-established until 1503, when certain devout youths, robed in white, went about the city repeating: "Pace, pace sia con noi! Pace, pace vuole e commanda Maria Vergine" (Peace be with us! The Virgin Mary wills and commands peace). The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="01155a.htm">Adria</a>, governor of the city, joined in this movement, and he was followed by all the magistrates and nobles, who bound themselves by <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to observe perpetual peace. The government of Viterbo was subsequently confided to, instead of the governor of the Patrimony, a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a>; after 1628 it was the residence of a simple governor. One of its <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> was <a href="12201b.htm">Reginald Pole</a>, around whom there grew up at Viterbo a coterie of friends, Vittoria Colonna among them, who aroused suspicions of <a href="07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a>. In 1860 the <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> had already advanced as far as Viterbo, when an order from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> recalled them.</p>

<p>Toscanella, which had recently resumed its ancient name of Tuscania, is a small town in the Province of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, about twelve and a half miles from Viterbo, on the River Marta and the ancient Via Clodia. It still preserves its <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> encircling walls. The two most interesting and most ancient churches are outside the city, those of S. Maria Maggiore, the old <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and of St. Pietro, situated on a hill, also at one time a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Both are notable for their Lombard architecture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, their <a href="13641b.htm">sculptures</a>, and their frescoes. The churches themselves date back as early as the fifth century; that of St. Leonardo, now a hay loft, preserved its fifteenth-century <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. The little Church of S. Francesco, also turned to profane uses, is decorated with frescoes by Giovanni Desparapane and his son (1466). The present <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was enlarged by Cardinal Gambara (sixteenth century) and restored in 1706; the "St. James" on the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a> is a notable work of Salvagni, and in one of the <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> are six fifteenth century statuettes taken from the old Abbey of St. Giusto. S. Maria delle Rose (1484) is remarkable for its <a href="05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. S. Maria del Riposo (1495), formerly a <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church, contains some good pictures. In the vicinity of <a href="15487a.htm">Toscanella</a> have been found Etruscan <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a>, which, however, have mostly gone to enrich the various museums of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The archivium of the commune contains most interesting papers.</p>

<p>Tuscania was anciently included in the territory of Tarquinia (Corneto). With the decay of the latter, the former grew, and became particularly important in the Lombard period, when it was a royal fief. Tuscania supported the Romans, to whom it was tributary, but after frequent conflicts with Viterbo finally yielded to it. From 1419 to 1421 it was under the lordship of Angelo Tartaglia, a soldier of fortune, the remains of whose palace are still extant, and to the tower of which access is gained by a subterranean passage. In 1495 Charles VIII, returning from the <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> campaign, wished to enter Toscanella, but being denied admission sacked the city and destroyed a great part of it. On 12 September, 1870, it was annexed to the <a href="08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. Toscanella was the native city of <a href="04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a>.</p>

<p>The episcopal See of Viterbo was transferred from Toscanella, which venerates the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Sts. Secundianus, Verianus, and companions (who, however, were Romans). They suffered not far from the city, to which their <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> were translated in the seventh century by Bishop Maurus, the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> known (649). Among the successors of Maurus may be mentioned Homobonus, to whom <a href="09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> (850) addressed a letter determining the boundaries of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 876 Joannes, in the name of <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, carried the imperial insignia to Charles the Bald. During the tenth century Toscanella was for some time under the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Centumcellae. The succession of its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> recommences with Joannes (1027); another Joannes distinguished himself in the reform of Benedict (1049) and brought back the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Tuscania to the common life. Gilbert (1059) and Giselbert (1080) were also promoters of reform, while Richard (1086) adhered to the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="07063a.htm">Clement III</a>, who united with Toscanella the <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> of Centumcellae and Blera (Bieda). In 1192 <a href="03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> formed Viterbo into a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, combining it with that of <a href="15487a.htm">Toscanella</a>. Among other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be noted is Ranieri (c. 1200), in whose episcopate the Paterini came to Viterbo, and this <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> had still to be combated in 1304. After him Cardinal Raniero Capocci was for a long time the administrator.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth century the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="15487a.htm">Toscanella</a> repeatedly refused to recognize the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> elected by the chapter of Viterbo, so that <a href="04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (1312) reserved to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the right of appointment. Bishop Angelo Tignosi (1318) laboured for peace among his fellow citizens. Niccolo dei Vetuli (1351) was famous as a physician and man of letters, and held an important <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod at <a href="10516a.htm">Montalto</a>. In 1435 the <a href="03798b.htm">Diocese of Corneto</a> was separated and joined with the then recently erected <a href="10529a.htm">Diocese of Montefiascone</a>. In 1467 was commenced the church of the image, or picture, of the Madonna della Quercia, a picture <a href="11395a.htm">painted</a> on a tile which had been hung by a peasant upon an oak tree (<em>quercia</em>). Other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Gian Pietro Gratti (1533), a distinguished writer; Sebastiano Gualtieri (1551) <span class="stiki">more properly spelled "Gualterio"</span>, the author of a diary of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; Cardinal Francesco Gambara (1561), a munificent restorer of churches; Alessandro Sforza Cesarini (1636), who began the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Viterbo, completed by <a href="02737a.htm">Cardinal Francesco Brancacci</a> (1638), a model of all the virtues; Michelangelo Conti (1712), afterward <a href="08022a.htm">Pope Innocent XII</a>; Cardinal Gabriele Severoli (1806), <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. The present <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr. Ant. M. Grasselli (1899), O.M.C., was formerly <a href="12456a.htm">delegate Apostolic</a> at Constantinople.</p>

<p>The canons of Viterbo received from <a href="02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> the privilege of the <a href="10404a.htm">mitre</a>, ring, and bugia. The <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> is interdiocesan for the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the Roman province north of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Toscanella also has a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of its own for <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> studies. Of Blera (Bieda) seventeen <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are known, the first of whom was Maximus (487). Other ancient <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are Barbarano (Martoranum) of which one <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Reparatus (647), is known, and Ferentum, the native place of the Emperor Otho, a famous <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of which was St. Bonifacius (sixth century). Here is the Cemetery of S. Eutichio.</p>

<p>The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is immediately subject to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
