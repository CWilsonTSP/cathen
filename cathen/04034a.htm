<p>Born at Sant&rsquo; Arcangelo, near <a href="13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, 31 October, 1705; died at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 22 September, 1774.</p>

<p>At the death of <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was in dire distress. Gallicanism and <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, <a href="06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> and <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> were up in rebellion against the authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>; the rulers of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> were on the side of the sectarians who flattered their dynastic prejudices and, at least in appearance, worked for the strengthening of the temporal power against the spiritual. The new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> would have to face a coalition of moral and political forces which <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> had indeed manfully resisted, but failed to put down, or even materially to check. The great question between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Bourbon princes was the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a>. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a> had taken place <em>de facto</em>; the accession of a new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was made the occasion for insisting on the abolition of the order root and branch, <em>de facto</em> and <em>de jure,</em> in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and all over the world.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> assembled 15 February, 1769. Rarely, if ever, has a <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> been the victim of such overweening interference, base intrigues, and unwarranted pressure. The ambassadors of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (d&rsquo;Aubeterre) and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Azpuru) and the Cardinals de Bernis (<a href="06166a.htm">France</a>) and Orsini (Naples) led the campaign. The Sacred college, consisting of forty-seven <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, was divided into Court <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <em>Zelanti</em>. The latter, favourable to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and opposed to the encroaching secular, were in a majority. "It is easy to foresee the difficulties of our negotiations on a stage where more than three-fourths of the actors are against us." Thus wrote Bernis to <a href="03694a.htm">Choiseul</a>, the minister of Louis XV. The immediate object of the intriguers was to gain over a sufficient number of Zelanti. D&rsquo;Aubeterre, inspired by Azpuru, urged Bernis to insist that the election of the future <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> be made to depend on his written engagement to <a href="14096a.htm">suppress the Jesuits</a>. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, however, refused. In a memorandum to <a href="03694a.htm">Choiseul</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 April, 1769, he says: "To require from the future <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> a promise made in writing or before witnesses, to destroy the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, would be a flagrant violation of the canon law and therefore a blot on the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the crowns." The King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Charles III) was willing to bear the responsibility. D&rsquo;Aubeterre opined that <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> and canon law had no standing against reason, which claimed the <a href="14096a.htm">abolition of the Society</a> for the peace of the world. Threats were now resorted to; Bernis hinted at a blockade of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and popular insurrections to overcome the resistance of the Zelanti. <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in virtue of their right of veto, excluded twenty-three of the forty-seven <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; nine or ten more, on account of their age or for some other reason, were not <em>papabili</em>; only four or five remained eligible. Well might the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, as Bernis feared it would, protest against <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> and separate on the plea of not being free to elect a suitable candidate. But d&rsquo;Aubeterre was relentless. He wished to intimidate the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. "A pope elected against the wishes of the Courts", he wrote, "will not be acknowledged"; and again, "I think that a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> of that [<a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a>] temper, that is without scruples, holding fast to no opinion and consulting only his own interests, might be acceptable to the Courts". The ambassadors threatened to leave <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> unless the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> surrendered to their dictation. The arrival of the two <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Solis and La Cerda, added new strength to the Court party. Solis insisted on a written promise to <a href="14096a.htm">suppress the Jesuits</a> being given by the future <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, but Bernis was not to be gained over to such a breach of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. Solis, therefore, supported in the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> by Cardinal Malvazzi and outside by the ambassadors of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, took the matter into his own hands. He began by sounding Cardinal Ganganelli as to his willingness to give the promise required by the Bourbon princes as an indispensable condition for election. &#151; Why Ganganelli? This <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was the only friar in the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. Of <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> birth (his father had been a surgeon at Sant' Arcangelo), he had received his <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> from the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="13057c.htm">Rimini</a> and the <a href="13588a.htm">Piarists</a> of <a href="15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, and, in 1724, at the age of nineteen, had entered the <a href="06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a> of St. Francis and changed his <a href="10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> (Giovanni Vincenzo Antonio) for that of Lorenzo. His talents and his virtues had raised him to the dignity of <em>definitor generalis</em> of his order (1741); <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> made him Consultor of the Holy Office, and <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> gave him the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat (1759), at the instance, it is said, of <a href="13033a.htm">Father Ricci</a>, the General of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. During the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> he endeavoured to please both the Zelanti and the Court party without committing himself to either. At any rate he signed a paper which satisfied Solis. <a href="04488a.htm">Cr&eacute;tineau-Joly</a>, the historian of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, gives its text; the future <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> declared "that he recognized in the <a href="12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to extinguish, with good <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Company of Jesus</a>, provided he observed the canon law; and that it was desirable that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the Crowns". The original paper is, however, nowhere to be found, but its existence seems established by subsequent events, and also by the testimony of Bernis in letters to <a href="03694a.htm">Choiseul</a> (28 July, and 20 November, 1769). Ganganelli had thus secured the votes of the Court <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; the Zelanti looked upon him as indifferent or even favourable to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; d&rsquo;Aubeterre had always been in his favour as being "a wise and moderate <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>"; and <a href="03694a.htm">Choiseul</a> had marked him as "very good" on the list of <em>papabili</em>. Bernis, anxious to have his share in the victory of the sovereigns, urged the election. On 18 May, 1769, Ganganelli was elected by forty-six votes out of forty-seven, the forty-seventh being his own which he had given to Cardinal Rezzonico, a nephew of <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>. He took the name of Clement XIV.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The new <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> first <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> clearly defined his policy: to keep the peace with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes in order to secure their support in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against irreligion. His predecessor had left him a legacy of broils with nearly every <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> power in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Clement hastened to settle as many as he could by concessions and conciliatory measures. Without revoking the constitution of <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> against the young Duke of <a href="11505a.htm">Parma's</a> inroads on the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, he refrained from urging its execution, and graciously granted him a <a href="05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to marry his cousin, the Archduchess Amelia, daughter of <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, soothed by these concessions, withdrew the uncanonical edict which, a year before, he had issued as a counterblast to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> proceedings against the infant Duke of <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a>, the king's nephew; he also re-established the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio's</a> tribunal and condemned some writings against <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> had been severed from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> since 1760; Clement XIV began his attempt at reconciliation by elevating to the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> Paulo de Carvalho, brother of the famous minister <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal</a>; active negotiations terminated in the revocation, by King Joseph I, of the ordinances of 1760, the origin and cause of the rupture between <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. A grievance common to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes was the yearly publication, on <a href="10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, of the censures reserved to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; Clement abolished this custom in the first <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> of his pontificate. But there remained the ominous question of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The Bourbon princes, though thankful for smaller concessions, would not rest till they had obtained the great object of their machinations, the <a href="14096a.htm">total suppression of the Society</a>. Although <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had still many powerful protectors: the rulers, as well as the public <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, protected them and their numerous establishments in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> electorates of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, in the Palatinate, <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and the many countries subject to the sceptre of <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, not to mention the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> and the foreign missions. The Bourbon princes were moved in their <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> by the spirit of the times, represented in Latin countries by French irreligious philosophism, by <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, Gallicanism, and Erastianism; probably also by the natural desire to receive the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction for their <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> proceedings against the order, for which they stood accused at the bar of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>. The victim of a man's <a href="08010c.htm">injustice</a> often becomes the object of his <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a>; thus only the conduct of Charles III, of <a href="12224b.htm">Pombal</a>, <a href="14446a.htm">Tanucci</a>, Aranda, Moni&ntilde;o can be accounted for.</p>

<p>An ever-recurring and almost solitary grievance against the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> was that the Fathers disturbed the peace wherever they were firmly established. The accusation is not unfounded: the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> did indeed disturb the peace of the enemies of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, for, in the words of d&rsquo;Alembert to <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, they were "the grenadiers of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> guard". Cardinal de Bernis, now French ambassador in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was instructed by <a href="03694a.htm">Choiseul</a> to follow the lead of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the renewed campaign against the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. On the 22nd of July, 1769, he presented to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> a memorandum in the name of the three <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Bourbon kings, "The three monarchs", it ran, "still believe the destruction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to be useful and <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>; they have already made their request to Your Holiness, and they renew it this day." Clement answered that "he had his <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> and <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> to consult"; he asked for a delay. On 30 September he made some vague promises to Louis XV, who was less eager in the fray than Charles III. This latter, bent on the immediate <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the order</a>, obtained from Clement XIV, under the strong pressure of Azpuru, the written promise "to submit to His Majesty a scheme for the absolute extinction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>" (30 November, 1769). To prove his sincerity the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> now commenced open hostilities against the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. He refused to see their general, <a href="13033a.htm">Father Ricci</a>, and gradually removed from his entourage their best friends; his only confidants were two <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> of his own order, Buontempo and Francesco; no princes or <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> surrounded his throne. The Roman people, dissatisfied with this state of things and reduced to starvation by maladministration, openly showed their discontent, but Clement, bound by his promises and caught in the meshes of Bourbon diplomacy, was unable to retrace his steps. The college and <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="06243a.htm">Frascati</a> were taken from the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and handed over to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the town, the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of York. Their <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> catechisms were prohibited for 1770. A congregation of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> hostile to the order visited the Roman College and had the Fathers expelled; the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and the German College were also attacked. The German College won its cause, but the sentence was never executed. The <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a> and students were sent back to their <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>. A similar system of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> was extended to Bologna, <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, <a href="06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, <a href="10413a.htm">Modena</a>, <a href="09492a.htm">Macerata</a>. Nowhere did the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> offer any resistance; they <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> that their efforts were futile. Father Garnier wrote: "You ask me why the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> offer no defence: they can do nothing here. All approaches, direct and indirect, are completely closed, walled up with double walls. Not the most insignificant memorandum can find its way in. There is no one who would undertake to hand it in" (19th Jan., 1773).</p>

<p>On 4 July, 1772, appeared on the scene a new Spanish ambassador, Joseph Moni&ntilde;o, Count of Florida Blanca. At once he made an onslaught on the perplexed <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. He openly threatened him with a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and probably in the other Bourbon states, such as had existed in <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> from 1760 to 1770. On the other hand, he promised the restitution of <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, still held by <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>. Whilst Clement's <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a> was roused by this latter <a href="14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> proposal, his good, but feeble, heart could not overcome the fear of a widespread <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Moni&ntilde;o had conquered. He now ransacked the archives of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> to supply Clement with facts justifying the promised <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a>. Moni&ntilde;o must be held responsible for the matter of the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Dominus ac Redemptor", i.e. for its facts and provisions; the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> contributed little more to it than the form of his supreme authority. Meanwhile Clement continued to harass the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of his own dominions, perhaps with a view to preparing the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world for the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a>, or perhaps hoping by his severity to soothe the <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a> of Charles III and to stave off the abolition of the whole order. Until the end of 1772 he still found some support against the Bourbons in King Charles Emmanuel of <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and in the <a href="09662d.htm">Empress Maria Theresa</a> of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. But Charles Emmanuel died, and <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, giving way to the importunate <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of her son <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> and her daughter the Queen of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, ceased to plead for the maintenance of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. Thus left to himself, or rather to the will of Charles III and the wiles of Moni&ntilde;o, Clement began, in November, 1772, the composition of the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of abolition, which took him seven months to finish. It was signed 8 June, 1773; at the same time a congregation of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> was appointed to administer the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the suppressed order. On 21 July the bells of the Ges&#249; rang the opening of the annual novena preceding the feast of St. Ignatius; the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, hearing them, remarked: "They are not ringing for the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> but for the dead". The <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a>, signed on 8 June, bears the date 21 July, 1773. It was made known at the Ges&#249; to the general (<a href="13033a.htm">Father Ricci</a>) and his assistants on the evening of 16 August; the following day they were taken first to the English College, then to Castel Sant&rsquo; Angelo, where their long trial was commenced. <a href="13033a.htm">Ricci</a> never saw the end of it. He died in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, to his last moment protesting his innocence and that of his order. His companions were set free under <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, their judges having found them "not guilty".</p>

<p>The <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>, "Dominus ac Redemptor" opens with the statement that it is the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> office to secure in the world the unity of mind in the bonds of peace. He must therefore be prepared, for the sake of charity, to uproot and destroy the things most dear to him, whatever pains and bitterness their loss may entail. Often the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, his predecessors, have made use of their supreme authority for reforming, and even dissolving, <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders which had become harmful and disturbed the peace of the nations rather than promoted it. Numerous examples are quoted, then the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> continues: "Our predecessors, in virtue of the plenitude of power which is theirs as Vicars of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have suppressed such orders without allowing them to state their claims or to refute the grave accusations brought against them, or to impugn the motives of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>." Clement has now to deal with a similar case, that of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Having enumerated the principal favours granted it by former <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, he remarks that "the very tenor and terms of the said Apostolic constitutions show that the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> from its earliest days bore the germs of dissensions and jealousies which tore its own members asunder, led them to rise against other <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, against the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, nay even against the sovereigns who had received them in their states". Then follows a list of the quarrels in which the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had been engaged, from <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> to <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>. <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> had hoped to silence their enemies by renewing the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of their Institute, "but the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> derived no consolation, the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> no help, <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> no advantage from the <a href="01640a.htm">Apostolic letters</a> of <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>, of blessed memory, letters which were wrung from him rather than freely given". At the end of this <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> reign "the outcry and the complaints against the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> increasing day by day, the very princes whose <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and hereditary benevolence towards it are favourably known of all nations &#151; our beloved Sons in <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the Kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and the two Sicilies &#151; were forced to expel from their kingdoms, states and provinces, all the religious of this Order, well knowing that this extreme measure was the only remedy to such great evils." Now the complete abolition of the order is demanded by the same princes. After long and mature consideration the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, "compelled by his office, which imposes on him the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to procure, maintain, and consolidate with all his power the peace and tranquillity of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> people &#151; persuaded, moreover, that the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> is no longer able to produce the abundant fruit and the great good for which it was instituted &#151; and considering that, as long as this order subsists, it is impossible for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> to enjoy free and solid peace", resolves to "suppress and abolish" the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, "to annul and abrogate all and each of its offices, functions, and administrations". The authority of the superiors was transferred to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; minute provisions were made for the maintenance and the employment of the members of the order. The <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> concludes with a prohibition to suspend or impede its execution, to make it the occasion of insulting or attacking anyone, least of all the former <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; finally it exhorts the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> to live in peace with all men and to <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</p>

<p>The one and only motive for the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a> set forth in this <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> is to restore the peace of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by removing one of the contending parties from the battlefield. No blame is laid by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> on the rules of the order, or the personal conduct of its members, or the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of their teaching. Moreover, Father Sydney Smith, S.J. (in "The Month", CII, 62, July 1903), observes: "The fact remains that the condemnation is not pronounced in the straightforward language of direct statement, but is merely insinuated with the aid of dexterous phrasing"; and he contrasts this method of stating grounds for the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a> with the vigorous and direct language used by former <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> in suppressing the <a href="07543a.htm">Humiliati</a> and other orders. If Clement XIV hoped to stop the storm of unbelief raging against the Bark of Peter by throwing its best oarsmen overboard, he was sorely mistaken. But is unlikely that he entertained such a fallacy. He <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who had been his first teachers, his trusty advisers, the best defenders of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> over which he ruled. No personal animosity guided his action; the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> themselves, in agreement with all serious historians, attribute their <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a> to Clement's weakness of character, unskilled diplomacy, and that kind of <a href="06636b.htm">goodness</a> of heart which is more bent on doing what is pleasing than what is right. He was not built to hold his head above the tempest; his hesitations and his struggles were of no avail against the enemies of the order, and his friends found no better excuse for him than that of <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a>: What could the poor <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> do when all the Courts insisted on the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a>? The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Cordara expresses the same mind: "I think we should not condemn the pontiff who, after so many hesitations, has judged it his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to <a href="14096a.htm">suppress the Society of Jesus</a>. I <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> my order as much as any man, yet, had I been in the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> place I should probably have acted as he did. The Xompany, founded and maintained for the good of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, perished for the same good; it could not have ended more gloriously."</p>

<p>It should be noted that the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> was not <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the form customary for <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> Constitutions intended as <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. It was not a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, but a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>, i.e. a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of less binding force and easier of revocation; it was not affixed to the gates of St. Peter's or in the Campo di Fiore; it was not even communicated in legal form to the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the general and his assistants alone received the notification of their <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a>. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> it was not published, the Gallican Church, and especially Beaumont, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, resolutely opposing it as being the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> personal deed, not supported by the whole Church and therefore not binding on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> thought the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> too lenient, for it condemned neither the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, nor the <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, nor the discipline of his victims. The court of <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> forbade its publication under pain of death. <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> allowed her son <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> to seize the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (some $10,000,000) and then, "reserving her rights", acquiesced in the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a> "for the peace of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>". <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> resisted a while; the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> cantons of <a href="09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, Fribourg, and Solothurn never allowed the Fathers to give up their colleges. Two non-Catholic sovereigns, Frederick of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and Catherine of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, took the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> under their protection. Whatever may have been their motives, whether it was to spite the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Bourbon Courts or to please their <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects and preserve for them the services of the best educators, their intervention kept the order alive until its complete restoration in 1804. Frederick persevered in his opposition only for a few years; in 1780 the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> was <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in his dominions. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> retained possession of all their colleges and of the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> until 1806 and 1811, but they ranked as <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and admitted no more <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>. But Catherine II resisted to the end. By her order the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of White Russia ignored the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="14096a.htm">suppression</a> and commanded the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to continue to live in communities and to go on with their usual work. Clement XIV seems to have approved of their conduct. The empress, in order to set at rest the scruples of the Fathers, engaged in several negotiations with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and had her will. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, too, the <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were not altogether without friends. Madame Louise de France, daughter of Louis XV, who had entered the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a> and was, with her sisters, the leader of a band of <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> at the court of her royal father, had worked out a scheme for re-establishing the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in six provinces under the authority of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Bernis, however, defeated their good intentions. He obtained from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> a new <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a>, addressed to himself and requesting him to see that the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> conformed, each in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Dominus ac Redemptor".</p>

<p>After the death of Clement XIV it was rumoured that he had retracted the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of abolition by a letter of 29 June, 1774. That letter, it was said, had been entrusted to his confessor to be given to the next <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. It was published for the first time in 1789, at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, in P. Ph. Wolf's "Allgemeine Geschichte der Jesuiten". Although <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> never protested against this statement, the authenticity of the document in question is not sufficiently established (De la Servi&eacute;re).</p>

<p>The first and almost the only advantage the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> reaped from his policy of concessions was the restoration to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> of <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. These provinces had been seized by the Kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> when <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> had <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> their kinsman the young Duke of <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> (1768). The restitution, following so closely on the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a>, seemed the price paid for it, although, to save appearances, the duke interceded with the two kings in favour of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and Clement, in the consistory of 17 January, 1774, took occasion from it to load the Bourbon princes with praises they little deserved. The hostile and <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> man&oelig;uvres against the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> continued unabated in many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> a royal commission for the reformation of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders had been at work for several years, notwithstanding the energetic protests of <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>; without the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent it had abolished in 1770 the congregations of Grandmont and of the exempt <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>; it had threatened the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, the Trinitarians, and the Minims with the same fate. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> protested, through his <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, against such abuses of the <a href="02137c.htm">secular power</a>, but in vain. The <a href="16020a.htm">Celestines</a> and the <a href="03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> were secularized that same year, 1770. The only concessions Louis XV deigned to make was to submit to Clement the general edict for the reformation of the French religious before its publication. This was in 1773. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> succeeded in obtaining its modification in several points.</p>

<p>In 1768 <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a> had ceded the Island of Corsica to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. At once a conflict arose as to the introduction of "Gallican usages". The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> sent a visitor Apostolic to the island and had the gratification of preventing the adoption of usages in opposition to the Roman practice. Louis XV, however, revenged himself by absolutely refusing to acknowledge the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> suzerainty over <a href="04396b.htm">Corsica</a>. Louis XV died in 1774, and one is rather surprised at the eulogy which Clement XIV pronounced in a consistory on "the king's deep <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and his admirable <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the defence of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion". He also hoped that the penitent death of the prince had secured his <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>. It may be surmised that he was prompted by a desire to please the king's youngest daughter, Madame Louise de France, Prioress of the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> of Saint-Denis, for whom he had always shown a great affection, attested by numerous favours granted to herself and to her <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>.</p>

<p>During Clement XIV's pontificate the chief rulers in German lands were <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and Frederick the Great, of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Frederick, by preserving the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in his dominions, rendered the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> a good, though perhaps unintended, service. He also authorized the erection of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in Berlin; the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> sent a generous contribution and ordered collections for the same purpose to be made in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, the Rhineland, and <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> lived up to the title of <em>Regina Apostolica</em> bestowed on her by <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>. But the doctrines of <a href="07463a.htm">Febronius</a> were prevalent at her court, and more than once she came into conflict with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. She refused to suppress a new edition of <a href="07463a.htm">Febronius</a>, as Clement XIV requested; she lent a willing ear to the "Grievances of the German nation", a scheme of reforms in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> making it more dependent on the prince than on the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>; she legislated for the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of her dominions without consulting <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. She maintained her edict on the religious against all the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> remonstrances, but withdrew her protection from the authors of the "Grievances", the Electors of Cologne, <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>. She also obtained from Clement in 1770 the institution of a <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. In other parts of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had to face similar difficulties. The number and wealth of the <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, in some instances their uselessness, and occasionally their disorders, tempted the princes to lay violent and rapacious hands on them. Numerous houses were to be suppressed in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> for the endowment of the new University of Ebersberg, in the Palatinate the reception of new religious was to be stopped; Clement opposed both measures with success. <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> is indebted to him for the University of M&uuml;nster, erected 27 May, 1773.</p>

<p>In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> Clement approved the Order of the Knights of the Immaculate Conception, instituted by Charles III. The king also desired him to define the <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception, but <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> blocked the way. <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, whilst it made a certain outward show of goodwill towards <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, continued to interfere in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs and to impose on colleges and <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> an <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> more in accord with French philosophism than with the spirit of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. At <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> the minister <a href="14446a.htm">Tanucci</a> hindered the recruitment of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; episcopal acts required the royal <em>placet</em>; the anti- religious press enjoyed high protection. <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> and <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> were another source of deep grief for Clement XIV. Whilst, politically, <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> was preparing its own ruin, the <a href="13588a.htm">Piarists</a> openly taught the worst philosophism in their <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and refused to have their houses visited by the <a href="11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. King Stanislaus planned the extinction of the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and favoured the <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasons</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was powerless; the few concessions he obtained from Catherine II for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of her new province were set at naught by that headstrong <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> as soon as it suited her politics. Of her own authority she created for the annexed <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> a new diocese (Mohileff) administered by a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Siestrencewicz) of <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> temper. Clement XIV had the satisfaction of seeing his <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, Caprara, favourably received at the Court of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and of initiating measures for the emancipation of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This turn in the relations between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> was due to the granting of royal honours to the king's brother when he visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1772; the same honours being refused to the Pretender. In the East, the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Patriarch, Mar Simeon, and six of his suffragans, were reunited to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> found little favour with either the Roman patriciate or the <a href="03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>; none of the many measures he took for the betterment of his people could atone, in their eyes, for his subserviency to the Bourbon Courts and for the <a href="14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a>. The last months of his life were embittered by the consciousness of his failures; at times he seemed crushed under the weight of sorrow. On the 10th of September, 1774, he took to his bed, received Extreme Unction on the 21st and died piously on the 22nd of the same month. Many witnesses in the process of <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. Alphonsus of Liguori attested that the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> had been <a href="10338a.htm">miraculously</a> present at the death-bed of Clement XIV to console and fortify him in his last hour. The <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>, who opened the dead body in presence of many spectators, ascribed death to scorbutic and h&aelig;morrhoidal dispositions of long standing, aggravated by excessive labour and by the habit of provoking artificial perspiration even during the greatest heat. Notwithstanding the <a href="05072b.htm">doctors'</a> certificate, the "Spanish party" and historical romancers attributed death to poison administered by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The mortal remains of Clement XIV rest in the church of the <a href="01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>.

The Marchese Caracciolo in his Preface is suspiciously reticent as to the channels through which he obtained them, and gives them in a French translation instead of in the original Italian. On this account, and because it is difficult to believe that some of the contents come from Fra Lorenzo [as Clement XIV was called in religion], many critics have rejected the entire collection as spurious. But VON REUTMONT thinks (<em>Ganganelli&mdash;Papst Clement&mdash;seine Briefe und seine Zeit,</em> 1847, Preface 40-42) that it is in substance a genuine collection, though some of the letters are spurious and interpolated. Von Reumont argues very justly that it would hardly be possible to fabricate so many letters, addressed to correspondents most of whom were alive at the time of the publication, and yet impart to them the unity, distinctness, and spontanedity of a living character."&mdash;CHRETINEAU&#173;JOLY, <em>Cl&#233;ment XIV et les J&#233;suites</em> (Paris, 1847); <em>Le Pape Cl&#233;ment XIV, Lettres au P.
