<p>The Archdiocese of Cincinnati (Cincinnatiensis) comprises that part of the <a href="11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a> lying south of 40 degrees, 41 minutes, being the counties south of the northern line of Mercer, Auglaize, Hardin, all west of the eastern line of Marion, <a href="15156a.htm">Union</a>, and Madison counties, and all west of the Scioto River to the Ohio River, an area of 12,043 square miles. The <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was erected 19 June, 1821; the archdiocese created 19 July, 1850.</p>

<h2>Early missionary life</h2>

<p>As early as 1749 a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Joseph de Bonnecamp, had traversed Northern and Eastern <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a> with De Blainville, who at the time was taking possession of the Valley of the Ohio in the name of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1751 another <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Armand de la Richardie, established a mission station at Sandusky. In 1795 Rev. Edmund Burke (afterwards first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07117b.htm">Halifax</a>) spent a short time among the Indians along the Maumee, but with little success. In 1790 a colony of French settlers located at Gallipolis on the Ohio, and Dom Peter Joseph Didier, a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, built a <a href="02781a.htm">church</a>, but growing discouraged left after a few years. The <a href="02200b.htm">Rev. Stephen T. Badin</a> visited Gallipolis in 1796. Bishop Flaget of Bardstown had charge at this time of <a href="08620b.htm">Kentucky</a> and <a href="14508a.htm">Tennessee</a> and the territory divided today into the States of Illinois, <a href="07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, <a href="10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, <a href="15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, and <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. In company with <a href="02200b.htm">Father Badin</a> he made a tour of Northern <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, passing through Chilicothe, Lancaster, and Somerset. The country was nothing but primeval forest. He met the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at what is today known as Somerset, and in response to their earnest appeal he asked the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> to come to their spiritual aid. In this way Father Fenwick, in later years the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cincinnati, was commissioned to take charge. It was here that he met John Fink, and in the latter's house, on the spot now occupied by the Somerset High School, the <a href="10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> was first offered for the asembled thirteen <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>. Some two years later Father Fenwick visited Somerset a second time, and secured from the Dittoe <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> a tract of three hundred acres for the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> on condition that a church and <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> be erected as early as possible. The buildings, at first small and primitive, have since been replaced by the more beautiful and commodious structure of St. Joseph's Priory. It was early in 1811 that the first attempt was made to organize a congregation in Cincinnati. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> interested in the work met on 13 December in the house of Joseph Fabler, but no definite action was taken. Bishop Flaget was passing through Cincinnati in 1814 on one of his episcopal visitations. The city, which today numbers within its corporate limits 400,000 people, and is one of the great centres of art, commerce, <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and religion, was at the time practically a wilderness dotted here and there with a small number of log-cabins reared by the sturdy settlers. On this occasion he met the representatives of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of Cincinnati. Their names, recorded in the early annals of the church, were Michael Scott, Patrick Reilly, Edward Lynch, Patrick Gohegan, John McMahon, John White, P. Walsh, and Robert Ward. Mr. Scott was one of the earliest <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers in <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, coming from <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1805 and eventually moving to Cincinnati. It was in his house that Bishop Flaget, on the occasion of his first visit, celebrated the first <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> in Cincinnati; on this occasion the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> urged the erection of a church as soon as means would permit. Their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, and spirit of sacrifice can be truly appreciated when one remembers the obstacles which confronted them, and the spirit of religious bigotry with which they were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to contend. A city ordinance forbade the erection of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church within the city limits. An appeal for assistance to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the East met with a ready and generous response, <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> was secured on the northwest corner of Vine and Liberty Streets, and with logs cut in the timberland of William Reilly, in Mayslick, Ky., rafted to Cincinnati, and carted by oxen to the site outside the corporate limits, they constructed in 1822 the first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in Cincinnati, a plain, barn-like structure. On the recommendation of Bishop Flaget, <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a> was made a <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> 19 June, 1821, with Cincinnati as the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>.</p>

<h2>Bishops</h2>

<h3>Edward Fenwick</h3>

<p>Edward Fenwick, a native of <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and a member of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, was appointed the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cincinnati, and made Administrator Apostolic of Michigan and the eastern part of the North-western Territory. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Bishop Flaget in St. Rose's Church, Washington County, <a href="08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, 13 January, 1822, and arriving in Cincinnati the same year he took up his residence at the junction of Ludlow and Lawrence Streets in a small house which served as an episcopal palace and a place of worship. His <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the log-church on the outskirts of the city, was several miles distant and at times almost inaccessible. The prohibitive ordinance had in the meantime been withdrawn, and the little edifice was placed on rollers and moved by oxen through the streets of Cincinnati to the site now occupied by the College of St. Francis Xavier. Shortly before, the diocese being without <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, or <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, Bishop Fenwick made a trip to <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> in quest of aid. Having received generous assistance from the nobility of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the reigning pontiff, he purchased upon his return the ground on Sycamore Street (the present site of <a href="06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> church), and on 19 May, 1825, the <a href="14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the old St. Peter's Cathedral was laid. The completed edifice was dedicated by Bishop Fenwick 17 December, 1826. The Athen&aelig;um, dedicated to <a href="06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, was opened 11 May, 1829, with Rev. H. Montgomery as <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, four <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and six preparatory students. Among the many gifts which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> had received in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> was a printing press, and from this went forth in October, 1831, the first edition of "The Catholic Telegraph", one of the oldest <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. At this time the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were few; the diocese extended from the Ohio River to the Lakes; the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, limited in number, were scattered over the most distant points, and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was compelled to visit his flock by stage, on horseback, or on foot. Cholera was raging throughout his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1832, and on 26 September of the same year he was stricken and died at Wooster. His remains were brought to Cincinnati and deposited in the old <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, now <a href="06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a>, 11 February, 1833. In 1846 they were transferred to the new <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, where they now repose. When he assumed charge of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in 1822, his flock numbered fifty <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>, the churches did not exceed five, and his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were the few pioneers brought from <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>; when he died, in 1832, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population had grown to seven thousand. The churches throughout the diocese and the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> had increased proportionately; a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> had been erected.</p>

<h3 id="B">John Baptist Purcell</h3>

<p><a href="12570a.htm">John Baptist Purcell</a> was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> second <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cincinnati, 13 October, 1833, in the Baltimore <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, Archbishop Whitfield being the consecrating <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a>. Immediately after his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> <a href="12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a> attended the Second <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and then with borrowed funds set out for his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. Upon his arrival in Cincinnati, 14 November, 1833, he found there only one church &mdash; St. Peter's Cathedral. Four Sisters of Charity had arrived in Cincinnati 27 October, 1829, to take charge of the first <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, and with six <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a> under their care started the first asylum for <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a> in the diocese. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was growing and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> were needed. The <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> was removed from the city to Brown County in 1839; but in 1845 it was brought back to the city, and the seminarists continued their studies in the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> under Father Nota up to 1848, when they were transferred to the episcopal residence, under the supervision of the Rev. David Whelan. On 27 January, 1847, Michael and Patrick Considine conveyed to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> a tract of five acres on Price Hill for a new <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, of which the <a href="14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> was laid on 19 July, 1848. The centre wing was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> blessed and opened 2 October, 1851, under the name of Mount St. Mary's of the West. From this institution went forth for a half-century the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the Middle West. Its history is inseparably interwoven with the history of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and its students cherished with feelings of reverence the names of its presidents, Fathers Hallinan, Quinlan, Barry, <a href="13191c.htm">Rosecrans</a>, Pabisch, Hecht, Byrne, Murray, and Mackey, all men of great learning and deep <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. In 1904 it was transferred to its present site: <a href="03473a.htm">Cedar</a> Point, Hamilton County, <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. The first German <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> church, the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, was erected in 1834, and the Rev. John Martin Henni, afterwards the first <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, was the first <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In 1837 he founded the "Wahrheitsfreund", the first German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. In 1907 it was merged with the "Ohio Waisenfreund". <a href="12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a> was always an ardent advocate of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and a pioneer in the defence of <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The progress of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> was such in the thirties as to cause alarm in certain quarters. Lyman Beecher's "Plea for the West" had gone forth, and the sentiment it moulded found expression in the <a href="12570a.htm">Purcell</a>-Campbell debate. The <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a> College of Teachers was in session, and the occasion was seized by the Rev. Alexander Campbell to accuse the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of being an enemy to enlightenment. He issued a challenge for an open debate; it was accepted, though reluctantly, by <a href="12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell</a>. The debate commenced 13 January, 1837, in the Campbellite church, and continued for seven days. Much of the existing prejudice was removed, and the numerous conversions to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> following the controversy were ample <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and its doctrines had been ably and eloquently defended by the young <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cincinnati. From this time an impetus was given to the spread of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> in Cincinnati and throughout the diocese. The fertility and wealth of the Ohio Valley had become known; many immigrated from the Eastern States, and <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a> received a large proportion of the <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a> whom unsatisfactory conditions at home induced to cross the sea to seek their fortunes in the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a>.</p>

<p>Communities of sisterhoods were invited to share the burden of supplying the growing needs of religion. The Sisters of Charity arrived in Cincinnati in 1829; the Sisters of Notre-Dame in 1840; the <a href="15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> in 1845; the Sisters of the Good Shepherd in 1857; the <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> and St. Francis in 1858; the <a href="12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> in 1868; and the Religious of the Sacred Heart in 1869. To these were added <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established a house in 1840; and there followed in succeeding years the Fathers of the Precious Blood (Sanguinists), the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, the <a href="11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, the Fathers of the Holy Cross, and the Brothers of Mary. The <a href="14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the present St. Peter's Cathedral was laid in 1841; it was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1845. The <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was strong and magnetic, and attracted all classes to him. The first German <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> for boys was opened in 1839, and that for girls in 1843. Eventually they were combined, and the German <a href="11322b.htm">Orphan Asylum</a> at Bond Hill is the successful outgrowth of both. Under the auspices of the St. Peter Benevolent Association for Orphans, formed 25 December, 1833, St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum was opened on 24 July, 1855. It is a monument to the generosity of the people and <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> to the needs of the four hundred inmates. Sixteen churches were built in the city and the immediate neighbourhood; the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were equally numerous. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population now exceeded 50,000, and it was deemed <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to erect a second diocese for the northern half of the state, at <a href="04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, of which, on 10 October, 1847, the Rev. Amadeus Rappe was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Not long afterwards Cincinnati was made an <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> (19 July, 1850).</p>

<p>In 1853 a wave of <a href="08677a.htm">Know-Nothingism</a> was sweeping over the country. Philadelphia and Louisville had been the scenes of riotous outbreaks. The <a href="02387a.htm">Most Rev. Cajetan Bedini</a>, titular <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="14562b.htm">Thebes</a>, who had been appointed <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to the court of <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, and had been commissioned to investigate certain causes of complaint at <a href="03037a.htm">Buffalo</a> and Philadelphia, arrived at Cincinnati in June, 1853. Prior to his coming popular prejudice was appealed to, his character was maligned, and crimes imputed to him of which he was innocent. On his arrival in Cincinnati the smouldering spirit of <a href="08677a.htm">Know-Nothingism</a> was fanned into a flame. On <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas night</a>, 1853, while the guest of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cincinnati, a mob determined upon his death marched to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, threatening to burn it. The loyalty of the people to their <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, who counselled <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and forbearance, put to shame and disarmed the spirit of revolt, while the action of the mob, disgracing the hospitality of Cincinnati by insulting an unoffending visitor of one of her citizens, was abhorred by every lover of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and order. Archbishop Hughes was the champion of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the East and the vigilant guardian of her interests; <a href="12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a> was the power which moulded her destiny in the West. His tongue and pen were always active in her defence. Broadminded and devoted to <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, he was <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> by all, irrespective of creed. Convinced that he was right, he never swerved from the path which <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> marked out for him to follow. Able and wise and fearless as a churchman, he was none the less loyal as a citizen. When the clouds of civil <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> were gathering, he proclaimed himself an advocate of the Union in opposition to the sentiments of a large number of his people, hoisted the flag upon the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> spire, and delivered an address, classic in thought and expression, which breathed the spirit of the patriot and lover of peace. He was signally <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>; and on the silver jubilee of his <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, in 1851 and 1858, on his return from the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, and on the occasion of the golden jubilee of his <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1876, the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, non- <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, vied with each other in their demonstrations of devotion to this patriarch of the West, who had laboured incessantly for half a century in the vineyard of the Lord.</p>

<p>Father Edward Purcell, the <a href="12570a.htm">archbishop's</a> brother, had conducted for years a private system of banking. Simple in its beginning and easy of control, it assumed in the course of years proportions which passed, it may be, beyond the grasp and management of an individual. The crisis and financial reverses came in 1879, it is not known how. In his eagerness to compensate the creditors, <a href="12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a> attempted to assume the responsibility of the <a href="02254a.htm">bankruptcy</a>. The courts decided that the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> was not <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, that Father Purcell was individually responsible, and that churches and institutions were liable for borrowed monies only. This <a href="04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> (of churches and institutions), amounting to some $200,000, was paid. The event hastened the death of Father Edward Purcell, and that of his brother followed on 4 July, 1883, at St. Martin's, Brown County, <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, where his remains now rest. The sorrow was universal. Some, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, in the hour of their losses, were disposed to blame, but the majority of citizens, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, believed firmly in the honesty of purpose of the deceased <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and his brother, whose only faults, if such they may be called, were their forgetfulness of self and their willingness to aid their struggling people. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which in 1833 comprised the <a href="11225d.htm">State of Ohio</a>, had grown from infancy to full manhood&mdash;400 churches and 100 <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> raised their crosses heavenward. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population amounted to 450,000, more than 85,000 being in Cincinnati alone. He found one church in Cincinnati upon his arrival; there were now upwards of thirty. The original diocese (embracing Cincinnati, <a href="04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, and <a href="04149a.htm">Columbus</a>) employed the services of 400 <a href="04049b.htm">clergymen</a>, 52 <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, 3 <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, 3 colleges, 25 academic institutions for girls, 22 <a href="11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, 1 protectory for boys, 6 <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 40 <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, and 266 <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The Archdiocese of Cincinnati at the time of his death had 180,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<h3 id="C">William Henry Elder</h3>

<p>William Henry Elder, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, <a href="10394a.htm">Mississippi</a>, was transferred to the titular See of Avara and made coadjutor to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cincinnati, with the right of succession, 30 January, 1880, and succeeded to the See of Cincinnati 4 July, 1883. He had been the first to extend his sympathy and to volunteer assistance to his predecessor in the hour of his affliction. He entered upon his episcopal <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> during the crucial period of the financial failure. Its settlement was brought about largely through the <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and wisdom of his administration. He received from Reuben R. Springer the generous bequest of $100,000, and in 1887 he reopened Mount St. Mary's Seminary of the West, which had been closed for eight years. In 1890 he founded St. Gregory's Preparatory Seminary at <a href="03473a.htm">Cedar</a> Point, Hamilton County, the Very Rev. J. C. Albrinck being its first <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. In 1904 it was transferred to Cincinnati and made a day college. Saintly and retiring, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> exercised an influence silent but effective by the unostentatious <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of his life. Judicious at critical moments, he ruled wisely. A <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> lover of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, he could be found in the confessional up to the close of his eighty- fifth year. He adhered closely to the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and exacted a similar fidelity in others. Two provincial councils were called, in 1883 and 1888. Several <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were convened and regulations framed, creating system and smoothness in the working of the archdiocese. The <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of his predecessor characterized his efforts in behalf of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. Charitable institutions were placed upon a firm basis, and the administration of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> made more methodical. He was <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> by all during life, and was mourned by all at his death, 31 October, 1904.</p>

<h3 id="D">Henry Moeller</h3>

<p>Henry Moeller, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04149a.htm">Columbus, Ohio</a>, 25 August, 1900, was promoted to the <a href="01701a.htm">archiepiscopal See of Areopolis</a> and made coadjutor to Archbishop Elder, with the right of succession, 27 April, 1903. He had been for twenty years Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, previous to his appointment to the <a href="04149a.htm">See of Columbus</a>.</p>

<h2>Causes of growth</h2>

<p>Up to 1829 there was practically no immigration to the West. In after years the fertility and wealth of the country lying between the Eastern mountains and the Mississippi directed thither the tide of incoming <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a>. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> famine of 1848, and political disturbances in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> about the same time, sent large numbers of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Germans to America. Friends had preceded them, and glowing accounts of the agricultural possibilities of <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a> attracted many to the Ohio Valley. Steamboat facilities after 1830 and railroads after 1838 contributed largely to increase the population. The Civil War did not retard materially the progress of religion.</p>

<h2>Pioneer priests</h2>

<p>The following are worthy of mention: Revs. E. Fenwick, <a href="02200b.htm">S.T. Badin</a>, J. J. Young, E. Thienpont, J. B. Lamy, Joseph P. Machebeuf, Frederic Rese, J. Ferneding, J. Reed, J. H. Luers, H. D. Juncker, Martin J. Henni, H. Kundig, B. Toebbe, W. Cheymol, J. J. Mullon, Thos. Bolger, and the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Joseph de Bonnecamp and Armand de la Richardie. Eight of these <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were raised to the episcopate. Among the <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> of distinction, the Fink and Dittoe <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> in the early years of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a> deserve to be remembered. In subsequent years the following merit special mention: Patrick and Michael Considine, John and Joseph Slevin, Stephen Boyle, Chas. Conahan, Joseph and Patrick Rogers, Joseph Butler, Joseph Heman, J. P. Carberry, Dr. Bonner, Col. McGroarty, James F. Meline, N. H. Hickman, Joseph Kline, B. VerKamp, F. A. Grever, Reuben R. Springer, Patrick <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, Joseph Nurre, H. Himmelgarn, Joseph Niehaus, and Nicholas Walsh. <a href="11755a.htm">Mrs. Sarah Peter</a> was active in the founding of <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>.</p>
