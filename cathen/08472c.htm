<p>Born at Montemoro Novo, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, 8 March, 1495, of devout <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>; died at <a href="06723a.htm">Granada</a>, 8 March, 1550. The wonders attending the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> birth heralded a life many-sided in its interests, but dominated throughout by implicit fidelity to the <a href="06689a.htm">grace of God</a>. A <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> whom he followed to Oropeza, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in his ninth year left him in charge of the chief shepherd of the place, to whom he gradually endeared himself through his punctuality and fidelity to <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, as well as his earnest <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. When he had reached manhood, to escape his master's well-meant, but persistent, offer of his daughter's hand in marriage, John took service for a time in the army of <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, and on the renewal of the proposal he enlisted in a regiment on its way to <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> to do battle with the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Succeeding years found him first at his birthplace, saddened by the news of his mother's premature death, which had followed close upon his mysterious disappearance; then a shepherd at Seville and still later at <a href="06550a.htm">Gibraltar</a>, on the way to <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, to ransom with his liberty <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> held captive by the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a>. He accompanied to Africa a Portuguese <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> just expelled from the country, to whom charity impelled him to offer his services. On the advice of his confessor he soon returned to Gilbratar, where, brief as had been the time since the invention of the printing-press, he inaugurated the Apostolate of the printed page, by making the circuit of the towns and villages about Gilbratar, selling religious books and pictures, with practically no margin of profit, in order to place them within the reach of all.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It was during this period of his life that he is said to have been granted the vision of the Infant <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Who bestowed on him the name by which he was later known, John of God, also bidding him to go to <a href="06723a.htm">Granada</a>. There he was so deeply impressed by the preaching of <a href="08469a.htm">Blessed John of Avila</a> that he distributed his worldly goods and went through the streets of the city, beating his breast and calling on <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for mercy. For some time his sanity was <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> by the people and he was dealt with as a madman, until the <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> preacher <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to desist from his lamentations and take some other method of atoning for his past life. He then made a <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the shrine of Our Lady of <a href="07044a.htm">Guadeloupe</a>, where the nature of his vocation was revealed to him by the Blessed Virgin. Returning to <a href="06723a.htm">Granada</a>, he gave himself up to the service of the sick and poor, renting a house in which to care for them and after furnishing it with what was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, he searched the city for those afflicted with all manner of disease, bearing on his shoulders any who were unable to walk.</p>

<p>For some time he was alone in his charitable work soliciting by night the needful supplies, and by day attending scrupulously to the needs of his patients and the rare of the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a>; but he soon received the co-operation of charitable <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and physicians. Many beautiful stories are related of the heavenly guests who visited him during the early days of herculean tasks, which were lightened at times by <a href="12640b.htm">St.Raphael</a> in person. To put a stop to the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> habit of exchanging his cloak with any beggar he chanced to meet, Don Sebastian Ramirez, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15105a.htm">Tuy</a>, had made for him a habit, which was later adopted in all its essentials as the religious garb of his followers, and he imposed on him for all time the name given him by the Infant <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, John of God. The saint's first two companions, Antonio Martin and Pedro Velasco, once bitter enemies who had <a href="13506d.htm">scandalised</a> all <a href="06723a.htm">Granada</a> with their quarrels and dissipations, were converted through his <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> and formed the nucleus of a flourishing congregation. The former advanced so far on the way of perfection that the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> on his death-bed commended him to his followers as his successor in the government of the order. The latter, Peter the Sinner, as he called himself, became a model of <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> and charity.</p>

<p>Among the many <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> which are related of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> the most famous is the one commemorated in the Office of his feast, his rescue of all the inmates during a fire in the Grand Hospital at <a href="06723a.htm">Granada</a>, he himself passing through the flames unscathed. His boundless charity extended to <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="11322b.htm">orphans</a>, those out of employment, poor students, and fallen <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. After thirteen years of severe <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a>, unceasing <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and devotion to his patients, he died amid the lamentations of all the inhabitants of <a href="06723a.htm">Granada</a>. His last illness had resulted from an heroic but futile effort to save a young man from drowning. The magistrates and nobility of the city crowded about his death-bed to express their gratitude for his services to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and he was buried with the pomp usually reserved for princes. He was <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, 21 September, 1638, and <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a>, 16 October, 1690. <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> made St. John of God patron of <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and the dying.
