<h2>Colonial period</h2>

<p>During the administration of the viceroy Baltasar de Zu&ntilde;iga Guzm&aacute;n de Sotomayor, Marqu&eacute;s de Valero, the first newspaper, supervised by J. Ignacio Mar&iacute;a de Castorena y Urs&uacute;a (<a href="12372a.htm">precentor</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Mexico and afterwards <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15737b.htm">Yucat&aacute;n</a>), was published in Mexico, January, 1722, with the heading "Gaceta de M&eacute;xico y Noticias de Nueva Espa&ntilde;a que se imprimir&aacute;n Cada mes y comienzan desde primero de Enero de 1722" (Gazette of Mexico and notices of New Spain which will be published every month, and which will begin the first of January, 1722). Later the name was changed to "Florilegio Historial de M&eacute;xico etc.", and in June of this year the enterprise was abandoned. In the numbers published, the news items were arranged according to the principal cities of the colony. With the second issue brief notices of the books being published in Mexico and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> were added and also accounts of important events in Lower California and the principal cities of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In January, 1728, the second publications the "Compendio de Noticias Mexicanas", edited by J. Francisco Sahag&uacute;n de Ar&eacute;valo Ladr&ouml;n de Guevara, appeared. This continued in circulation until November, 1739, when it was succeeded by the "Mercuriode Mexico", edited by the same <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>. The "Mercurio" was issued monthly and in the same form as the "Gaceta" and "Florilegio". Among its news items were, accounts of religious festivals, <em>autos de f&eacute;</em>, competitions for the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> faculties, <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> events, shipping news at the port of <a href="15344c.htm">Vera Cruz</a>, and news from the <a href="12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>, and even <a href="10574a.htm">Morocco</a>. When there was an abundance of news a fortnightly issue appeared. The desire to keep readers informed on the most important events connected with the Spanish Monarchy, e.g., the conquest of the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, is evident. In 1742 the "Mercurio" discontinued publication and no paper existed until 1784, when the new "Gaceta de M&eacute;xico", edited by M. A. Vald&eacute;s, appeared and continued without interruption until 1809. It was issued bi-monthly, modelled more or less on the gazettes of 1722 and 1728; it indicated the price of bread and meat in the <a href="10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a> and published officially and integrally the royal orders. To Ignacio Bartolache and the <a href="01374d.htm">Rev. Jos&eacute; Antonio Alzate</a>, well-known Mexican writers of the eighteenth century, is due the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of having issued the first scientific publications. The former published (1772) the "Mercurio Volante", which was short-lived; it was characterized as a newspaper giving curious and important notices upon various matters bearing on physics and medicine ("con noticias curiosas &eacute; importantes sobre varios asuntos de F&iacute;sica y Medicina"). <a href="01374d.htm">Alzate</a> began (1768) the "Diario Literario de M&eacute;xico"; this was suppressed, but reappeared on 26 October under the title of "Asuntos, Varios Sobre Ciencias y Artes". After eleven numbers were published it was again suppressed, only to reappear (1787) under the title of "Observaciones sobre F&iacute;sica, Historia Natural y Artes Utiles", fourteen numbers of which were issued. In January; 1788, the famous "Gaceta de Literatura" appeared and was issued monthly, though with some irregularity, until 1799. This publication was a literary and scientific review; all subjects were examined and discussed by the learned priest-editor. Here might be read with benefit articles on medicine, botany, mineralogy, Mexican arch&aelig;ology, architecture, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, ethnology, <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, physics, <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, topography, etc. The files are a veritable encyclopedia, and the number and variety of the subjects treated, as well as the scholarly manner in which they are handled, are evident <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="01374d.htm">Father Alzate's</a> remarkable erudition. On 1 October, 1805, Jacobo Villaurrutia, established the "Diario de M&eacute;xico", the first daily paper published in the colony; it was issued every day, including holidays, until 1816. Among its contributors were Navarette, S&aacute;nchez* de Tagle, Barguera, Anastasio Ochoa, and Lacunza y Buraz&aacute;bal. The "Gaceta del Gobierno de M&eacute;xico", founded in 1810, was the official organ of the viceregal Government until 1821.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Period of the War of Independence</h2>

<p>The first newspaper devoted to the cause of independence was the "El Despertador M&eacute;xicano", edited by Francisco Severo Maldonado. It was begun on 20 December, 1810, but did not last long. The second newspaper controlled by the insurgents was the "Ilustrador Nacional". The editor, Dr. Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Cos, made the type from wood and mixed indigo for the printing ink. When he was able to procure metal type, he continued to publish his newspaper under the title "El Ilustrador Americano". It lasted from May, 1812, until April, 1813. The viceregal Government and the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> rigidly prohibited it. The latter <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> to give up their copies, and denounced those who retained any. The third newspaper, "El Correo Americano del Sur", appeared in February, 1813. The <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="10565b.htm">Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Morelos</a>, after conquering <a href="11180a.htm">Oaxaca</a> and organizing his government, established it and confided the editing first to J. M. de Herrera, formerly <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of Huamustitl&aacute;n, and afterwards to the lawyer, Carlos M. <a href="03088b.htm">Bustamante</a>. The paper was issued every Thursday until 27 May of the same year. Upon the proclamation of the freedom of the press, two newspapers, "El Juguetillo" and "El Pensador M&eacute;xicano", edited respectively by C. M. <a href="03088b.htm">Bustamante</a> and Joaqu&iacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez de Lizardi, appeared; they fearlessly attacked the abuses of the viceregal Government. The "Juguetillo" published only six numbers, and both were suppressed by the Viceroy Venegas in December, 1812. Lizardi was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, but was liberated shortly afterwards, and continued the publication of his paper, eliminating, however, its offensive tone. <a href="03088b.htm">Bustamante</a> escaped <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and published two more numbers of the "Juguetillo", the last in 1821. Among other newspapers published during this period may be mentioned: "Clamores de la Fidelidad Americana", published in <a href="15737b.htm">Yucat&aacute;n</a> by Jos&eacute; Mat&iacute;as Quintana, for which he was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>; the "Bolet&iacute;n Militar", published by General Mina from the printing press which he carried with his expedition; the army of Iturbide published several sheets "El M&eacute;xicano Independiente", "Ej&eacute;rcito Imperial de las Tres Garant&iacute;as", "Diario Pol&iacute;tico Militar M&eacute;xicano". The "Centinela contra Seductores" was an anti-insurgent paper, issued towards the end of 1810; the "Especulador Patriotico" (1810-11), a weekly dedicated to the Viceroy Venegas. J. M. Wenceslas S&aacute;nchez* de la Barquera issued several interesting papers, including "Semanario econ&oacute;mico de noticias curiosas y eruditas sobre Agricultura y dem&aacute;s Artes y Oficios" (1808-10); "El Correo de los Ni&ntilde;os" (1813), the first juvenile paper published in Mexico; and "El Amigo de los Hombres" (1815). The "Noticioso General" (1815-22), the largest newspaper of the colony, published official documents and news of all kinds. At first it was issued every fortnight, but afterwards it appeared on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>

<h2>After the War of Independence</h2>

<p>When the Independence of Mexico was established newspapers were multiplied. Some approved, others condemned, the new regime, according to the policies adopted by the new Government. Carlos Mar&iacute;a <a href="03088b.htm">Bustamante</a> published (1821-26) thirty numbers of "La Avispade Chilpancingo", attacking the Iturbide administration. In 1822 were published "El Sol" and "El Correo de la Federaci&oacute;n", organs respectively of the <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> of the Scottish (centralistic), and York (federalistic), Rite. The <a href="09212a.htm">Liberals</a> controlled two important publications, "El Siglo XIX" and "El Monitor Republicano". G&oacute;mez Pedraza, Otero, Payno, de la Rosa, Zarco Vigil, and others contributed to the first, and to the second, which was even more radical in its <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, Florencio Castillo, Valente, Baz, Mateos etc., and Castelar as Spanish correspondent. The Conservatives published "La Sociedad" (edited by Jos&eacute; M. Roa Barcena) and "La Cruz" (edited by Ignacio Aguilar y Marocho). The first number of "La Cruz" appeared on 1 Nov., 1855; its heading states that "it is an exclusively religious paper, founded <em>ex-professo</em> to diffuse <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> doctrines, and to defend and vindicate them against the prevalent <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>". In its prologue it sums up the situation of that time, deplores the attacks on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the satires against the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>; it urges the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> to prepare themselves for the struggle in defence of religion. The paper had four divisions; the first explained the teachings of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on points which circumstances deemed it most opportune to treat; the second refuted all <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> advanced against this teaching; the third published short essays on religious subjects; the fourth gave accounts of all notable events, in the Republic and in other countries, that had a bearing on the special object of the publication. Unfortunately this weekly lasted only until 29 July, 1858. Its battles against the <a href="09212a.htm">Liberals</a> were sharp and brilliant, and its contributors gave striking examples of their learning and profound adhesion to the teaching of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. During the civil <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> the Press in many instances, particularly during the heated discussions that characterized the period prior to the Constitution of 1857, deserted its office of peacemaker and seemed to have for its only object the arousing of political enmities. And it was not without danger that a journalistic career was followed in those days. The "Veracruzano" of 7 October, 1862, referring to the overthrow of the Government of Miram&oacute;n and the capture of the capital of Mexico by Ju&aacute;rez (1 Jan., 1861), announced the assassination of Vicente Segura, editor of "Diarode Avisos" and political antagonist of the victorious party, declaring that "in this truly significant manner demagogism fulfilled the first of the guarantees of the system of <a href="09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>, freedom of the press". Notwithstanding the risks involved in the expression of animus in connexion with this crime, several publications endeavoured to stem the torrent of pernicious <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> which had been loosed. The editor of the "Pajaro Verde" had to close his establishment; and the principal contributor to "El Amigo del Pueblo" was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. A <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, suspected of circulating pamphlets, was, without <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of any sort, thrown into <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>. His printing-press was confiscated, and later he was exiled.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>During the Empire of Maximilian</h2>

<p>Four papers, the "Diario del impeno", "L'Ere Nouvelle", "La Raz&oacute;n" and "L'Estafette", supported more or less openly the Imperial Government, may be mentioned. In their attitude towards religion (favourable or unfavourable, according to the dictates of the members of the imperial cabinet) they lacked the freedom and independence which make a paper the representative of the sentiments of the people. Some independent journals ("La Sociedad") were also issued, and from time to time published articles which called the attention of the Imperial Government to their columns.</p>

<h2>The present time</h2>

<p>After the fall of the empire and especially since the presidential tenure of office of General Porfirio Diaz, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press has enjoyed a little more freedom. With the exception of the local papers published in the various states, which did not cease to work for the cause ("El Amigo de la Verdas" of Pueblo and others), the first newspaper to continue the traditions of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalists of other days was "La Voz de Mexico" (1870-4900). It counted many distinguished writers on its staff, and, as a paper which had never been aught but loyal to the cause it had espoused, it earned the respect and good will of everyone. Shortly before it ceased publication, "El Pais" (now in its twelfth year, and an active defender of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests) was founded. "El Nacional", another <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, published for a number of years, rendered good service to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. On 1 July, 1883, Victoriano Agueros founded "El Tiempo", which is undoubtedly the most important of all political daily papers of the republic supporting <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. In two years its circulation increased from 1000 to 6000 copies. By the vigour with which it attacked the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the government of Manuel Gonz&aacute;lez* it won great popularity, but this attitude won <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> for the editor and contributors, who were several times <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. In 1887 the editorial office was closed and publication suspended for eleven days. But today the paper defends its ideals as undauntedly as before. The literary edition (begun in 1883), published every <a href="14335a.htm">Sunday</a> and to which many notable writers, including Ipandro Arc&aacute;tico (Arcadian name of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of S. Luis Potosi), Joaqu&iacute;n Garc&iacute;a Icazbalceta, J. Mar&iacute;a Roa Barcena, Jos&eacute; Sebasti&aacute;n Segura, and others contributed, gave prominence to the work of many native authors, which would otherwise have remained unpublished. Its columns have always been open to the discussion of all questions contributing to the progress and aggrandizement of Mexico. An illustrated Sunday edition, "El Tiempo Ilustrado", has also been added to the publications connected with "El Tiempo". Among the illustrated monthly reviews may be mentioned "El Mensajero del Coraz&oacute;n de Jes&uacute;s", which has received much favourable notice.
