<p>The University of St. Louis, probably the oldest <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> west of the Mississippi River, was founded in the City of St. Louis in 1818 by the Right Reverend Louis William Du Bourg, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. Since 1827 the institution has been under the direction of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. On 16 November, 1818, Bishop Du Bourg opened St. Louis Academy, putting it in charge of the Reverend Fran&ccedil;ois Niel and others of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> attached to St. Louis Cathedral; in 1820 the name of the institution was changed to St. Louis College. The college was successful, but the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, owing to their numerous <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, found it difficult to attend to this professorial work. In consequence Bishop Du Bourg, who had been President of <a href="06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>, soon began to formulate plans to put St. Louis College in care of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, for he realized that its existence would be precarious without some such guarantee for supplying a corps of trained professors. He therefore made application to the Provincial of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, but his request could not be granted, as the establishments of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> at <a href="06458a.htm">Georgetown</a> and elsewhere in the eastern states fully occupied all the members at that time. However, early in 1823, Bishop Du Bourg visited Washington to consult with James Monroe, President of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, and John C. Calhoun, Secretary of War, on the Indian affairs of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Mr. Calhoun suggested that he invite the <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to give him their assistance in this difficult pioneer work. Bishop Du Bourg thereupon once more entered into negotiations with the Provincial of <a href="09755b.htm">Maryland</a> offering to make over to the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> in St. Louis, which comprised church and college, as well as a farm near Florissant, Mo., for an Indian <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, if the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> would establish themselves in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The provincial accepted that part of the proposition which referred to the Indian <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, but stated that <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> could not be spared for the St. Louis <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> project. Accordingly in June, 1823, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from Whitemarsh, Md., took up their abode in Florissant where they opened an Indian <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. In 1824 they yielded to Bishop Du Bourg's earnest solicitations to take over St. Louis College, but the transfer was not actually effected until 1827.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The last session of St. Louis College under the management of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> was that of 1826-27. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> decided to erect new college buildings on <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> given by Bishop Du Bourg, and in the interval the pupils of St. Louis College were accommodated at Florissant. Thence they were transferred to the new establishment in St. Louis where classes were opened under <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> masters on 2 November, 1829. In its new environments the college flourished, and in 1832 received its charter as a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> by act of the Missouri Legislature. President Verhaegen at once began to organize the post-graduate faculties. In 1834 the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of divinity was established, which continued its courses until 1860. A faculty of medicine was constituted in 1836 and was eminently successful until 1855 when, owing to the <a href="08677a.htm">Know-Nothing</a> movement, its separation from the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was deemed advisable. A law <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was organized in 1843 but was closed four years later. In 1889 the work of reconstructing these faculties was begun. The <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> was opened in 1889; the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of divinity in 1899; the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine in 1903; the dental college, <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of advanced <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, and institute of law in 1908; the department of meteorology and seismology in 1909; and the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of commerce and finance in 1910. Although founded in the pioneer days of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in the West, the old professional <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> did excellent work. Dr. William Beaumont, widely known for his observations in the case of Alexis St. Martin, was among the first professors of the medical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. Rush Medical College of <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a> owes its existence to an early professor at the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, Dr. Brainard, and the Cooper Medical College of <a href="13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> was founded by an alumnus, Dr. Cooper. Another student of those early days, Dr. L.C. Boisliniere, wrote a text-book on obstetrics, which is still of considerable value. In 1848 Dr. M.L. Linton organized the first medical monthly in America, "The St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal." Buckner, Barret, Garesche, and Sharp, of the old Law School, were men of national prominence in their day. Eight American <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> have had intimate connections with the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>: Du Bourg of Louisiana, as founder; Rosati of St. Louis, as patron and benefactor; Van de Velde of <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a> and Carrell of <a href="04462b.htm">Covington</a>, as presidents; Mi&egrave;ge, <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Indian Territory, as a professor; de Neckere of <a href="11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, Harty of <a href="09597b.htm">Manila</a>, and Chartrand, Auxiliary of <a href="07744a.htm">Indianapolis</a>, as students. Other students of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> who rose to prominence in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs are the <a href="01466a.htm">Very Rev. A.M. Anderledy</a>, General of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and the Reverends Joseph Keller and R.J. Meyer, English assistants to the General of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>. Fathers Carrell, Heylen, Smarius, Damen, and Conway were noted preachers connected with the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>.</p>

<p>From an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, members of the faculty devoted themselves to writing. Walter H. Hill, S.J., was among the first to write text-books on scholastic philosophy in English, and his works are still widely used. "The Happiness of <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>," by Florentine Boudreaux, S.J., and "The Imitation of the Sacred Heart," by <a href="01750b.htm">Peter Arnoudt, S.J.</a>, have gone through many editions (the most recent, 1910), and have been translated into most modern languages. Joseph Keller, R.J. Meyer, F. Garesch&eacute;, and Joseph Fastre, all of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, wrote on ascetical subjects, while the writings of <a href="04752a.htm">Pierre Jean de Smet</a> did much to bring the Indian Missions into public notice. Within recent years books and studies on philosophy, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, pedagogy, and canon law have been published by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> professors, <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, Otten, Higgins, Coppens, Gruender, Conway, Rother, Martin, Conroy, and Fanning. Fathers Coppens and McNichols have issued textbooks on <a href="05458a.htm">English literature</a>. Father Thomas Hughes is well known as an authority on the history of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and is the author of "Loyola and the Educational System of the Jesuits." Fathers Finn, Copus, and Spalding are the authors of books of fiction for the young which have an extensive circulation. Professors Harris and Steele have published text-books on law, Professor Harris' work on "Wills" being noteworthy among recent contributions on the subject. Professors Eycleshymer, Thompson, Lyon, Neilson, Chaddock, Engman, and Loeb have written on medical topics. Scientific studies have been published by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> professors, de Laak, Monaghan, Borgmeyer, and Coony. Among the alumni who have won distinction in the field of history may be mentioned, E.B. O'Callaghan, Lucien Carr, Paul Beckwith, and Firmin Rozier; and in general literature, John Lesperance, Conde B. Pallen, and Irwin Russell.</p>

<p>Through its early missionaries who founded many settlements throughout the West, and through its alumni, many of whom have risen to high rank in civil and professional life, the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> has contributed much to the upbuilding of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in the West. Within a few years after the coming of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to St. Louis more than forty establishments had been made; the work of <a href="04752a.htm">de Smet</a>, who founded missions as far to the North-west as <a href="11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, is famous. Adrian and Christian Hoecken, Ponziglione and others from the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> evangelized Indians and whites throughout the West; many of these early missions became the centres of flourishing communities. In <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> the direct influence of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> has been wide, no less than thirteen colleges and professional <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> having been founded by its professors or alumni. Degrees have been conferred from 1834 to 1911 as follows: Doctors, Ph.D., 27; LL.D, 33; M.D., 935; D.D.S., 107; Mus.D., 1; total, 1103. Masters, M.A., 175; M.S., 1; total, 176. Bachelors, <a href="01756c.htm">B.A.</a>, 402; B.S., 75; Ph.B., 5; LL.B., 59; B.F.A., 2; B.C.S., 1; total, 544. Grand total of degrees conferred, 1823. During this period 722 members of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> completed the full courses of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of divinity and <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>.</p>

<h2>Present status</h2>

<p>St. Louis University consists of the college, the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of divinity, the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of advanced <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, the department of seismology and meteorology, the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine, the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of dentistry, the institute of law, and the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of commerce and finance. In December, 1910, the General of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, Very Rev. F.X. Wernz, by official act constituted St. Louis University a <em>collegium maximum</em>. This is a title conferred in recognition of the <a href="15188a.htm">university's</a> rank among <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>. </p>

<p>The University Library contains more than 70,000 volumes, among them many rare and valuable works. There are also special <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a> in each department of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. The museum contains specimens illustrating the fields of geology, pal&aelig;ontology and ethnology; the art collection though small contains some <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> of considerable merit. The "Fleur de Lis," a literary publication, and a number of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, literary, and scientific <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, several of which publish their proceedings, furnish the student added opportunities for <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> development; the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary and other religious organizations offer additional aids to <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. University athletics are controlled by a students' association working in connection with the Faculty Board of Athletics. The gymnasium is fairly equipped and a splendid campus has been recently secured. The Alumni Association with records <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1828 is well organized and helps much to promote loyalty to the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. The General Catalogue, issued annually, and the Announcements published by the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> from time to time during the year, furnish detailed information in regard to the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>.</p>
