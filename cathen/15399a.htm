<p>St. Viator, <a href="09111a.htm">lector</a> of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, lived in the fourth century and is the earliest type of the teacher of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, In the exercise of the then important functions of the lectorate, namely in reading and expounding the Scriptures to the people and in catechizing the children, he displayed that <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> and ability for which he was held in such high esteem by his <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Saint Just, and by the <a href="03744a.htm">Christian flock</a> of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Hagiographers refer to him as "a most holy youth, who on account of his eminent virtues was much beloved by his <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>". After the Council of <a href="01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> (381) St. Just decided to spend the remainder of his life in the penitential solitudes of Thebais, and selected young Viator as the companion of his <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> exile. Both the aged <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his youthful <a href="09111a.htm">lector</a> died in the odour of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> in an austere <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sc&eacute;t&eacute; in the year 389. The feast of St. Viator, according to the Roman <a href="09741a.htm">martyrology</a>, is observed on 21 October.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Because St. Viator had sanctified himself in teaching the young, he was selected as the patron of a community of <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> or catechists, who are <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and teaching brothers living on a footing of religious equality. This community, known as the Clerics of St. Viator, was founded in the year 1835 by the Very Rev. Father Louis-Joseph Querbes, <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the village of Vourles in the <a href="09472a.htm">Archdiocese of Lyons</a>. Desirous of securing <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers for his own and for neighbouring <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, where sad havoc had been wrought by the Reign of Terror, Father Querbes established at Vourles as early as 1829 a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for the training of lay teachers, which was soon officially sanctioned by the Royal Council of Public Instruction. In 1835 this organized band of secular teachers developed into a community of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and brothers with the <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion, and was approved by the <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> authority of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. With the assistance of the Roman <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Father Querbes obtained the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of his new community from <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in 1838. Under the generalship of Father Querbes the membership of the community increased so rapidly that before the time of his death (1 Sept., 1859) there existed three provinces of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and one in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>; and the Clerics, besides teaching very many <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, conducted the boarding colleges of Camonil (Rodez), St-Michel (Paris), St. Angeau College, the Deaf and Dumb College of <a href="13107a.htm">Rodez</a>, <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of agriculture at Blancotte and Notre-Dame de Treize-Pierres, and at Fontaines-sur-Saone a well-equipped publishing house from which were issued a large number of practical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> classics and <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> magazines such as "L'Ecole et la Famille" and "L'Ange Gardien", setting forth the necessity of co-operation between home, church, and <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>, parent, and teacher in view of the best <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> results.</p>

<p>All the important houses of the community have been suppressed in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, where some two hundred members of the institute are still teaching in what are called <em>Ecoles Libres</em>. The exiled members are conducting flourishing <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, where the superior-general now resides. In 1847 Bishop Bourget, of <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, obtained from Father Querbes teachers for a small college recently founded in <a href="08496b.htm">Joliette</a>, <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Father S. Champagneur, C.S.V., who was appointed president of the college, opened a <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in Joliette in 1848, and became provincial superior of the new obedience of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, which developed rapidly in membership and efficiency. Soon Bourget College arose in Rigaud, the Deaf and Dumb School and the St. Louis School in <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, the St. Viator School in Juliette, and ten commercial colleges in the villages of the <a href="12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>. With this impetus the community continued to make rapid strides under the successors of Father Champagneur, Fathers Lajoie, Beaudry, and Ducharme, who found it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to enlarge the colleges of Bourget and <a href="08496b.htm">Joliette</a>. This last is now known as the Seminaire de Joliette, and is admittedly one of the best-equipped colleges of the Dominion. Having now three hundred <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and brothers, the Provincial administration was able to accept the large Ecole St. Jean Baptiste, <a href="10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and to open colleges in St. Joseph de Levis, Berthier, Terrebonne, Boucherville, St. Remi, and to take charge of a large number of primary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the Clerics of St. Viator, sometimes called Viatorians, have since 1865 had important <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in Bourbonnais, Kankakee, St. George, Aurora, and <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, <a href="07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, in St. Joseph's parish, Cohoes, New York, in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, <a href="11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>, New York, and in <a href="02213b.htm">Baker City</a>, <a href="11288a.htm">Oregon</a>. In all these <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, except that of Bourbonnais, the Brothers have gradually been replaced by Sisters. The members of the community are now exercising their <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> activities almost exclusively in high school and college work. Owing chiefly to this change in the <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> conditions of the country, the Brothers of the American province more often embrace the larger opportunities offered by their community to pursue courses leading to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The most important institution of the Viatorians in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> is St. Viator College, Bourbonnais, <a href="07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, which grew out of the original district or village <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, first into a commercial academy in 1865 upon the arrival of Father P. Beaudoin, and Brothers Martel and Bernard; then in 1868 with Father Thomas Roy, recently from <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the young <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> evolved into a classical college. The institution won the patronage of the public and the favour of the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. After nine years of work Father Roy, whose memory was enshrined by his students in the beautiful Roy Memorial Chapel, returned in broken health to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and was succeeded by Father M. J. Marsile, who directed the growing institution for over a quarter of a century. Under Father Marsile's presidency, courses and faculties in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, and languages were strengthened, and several branches were added to divers other courses to answer, the need of the times. In his <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> his students built the Marsile Alumni Hall as a memorial. In 1906 the several buildings of St. Viator College were destroyed by fire. Courses were continued in improvised quarters and new buildings were erected. Father Marsile then resigned the presidency and Rev. J. P. O'Mahony, C. S. V., was appointed his successor. The college for several years has had a yearly enrollment of over three hundred students, and nearly three hundred <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious are numbered among its alumni. The list of commercial graduates and alumni who have entered the professions of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and medicine is larger still. St. Viator College has, besides a preparatory department and high school, the four years' college course proper. There is also, chiefly for the scholastics of the community, a complete four years' course of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, to which <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> students are admitted.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1910 Bishop O'Gorman, of <a href="14016b.htm">Sioux Falls, South Dakota</a>, purchased from the Federal Government a group of ten <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> buildings situated in Chamberlain, and placed these in the hands of the community of St. Viator. The <a href="08670c.htm">Knights of Columbus</a> took an active interest in the founding of the new institution, which therefore was called Columbus College. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the Viatorians have also undertaken the care of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. They have now charge of: the Maternity <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, Bourbonnais, Illinois; St. Edward's and St. Viator's, <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>; St. Mary's, Beaverville, Illinois; and in Chamberlain, Pukwana, and Plankinton, <a href="14160a.htm">South Dakota</a>; and the five missions attached to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of McMinnville, <a href="11288a.htm">Oregon</a>. In years past they were <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> in St. George, Manteno, Aurora, Dwight, Brimfield, and St. Jean Baptiste, <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Illinois. In 1882 the establishments of the middle west became independent of the <a href="03227a.htm">Canadian</a> province and were erected into a separate obedience. Very Rev. Father C. Fournier was appointed superior, and opened a <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in Bourbonnais, 6 Oct., 1882. In 1888 the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and the headquarters of the provincial administration were moved to <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. During the twenty-five years of his incumbency as provincial and master of <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>, Father Fournier supplied the new province with the needed force of well-trained teachers for the various <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Very Rev. A. Corcoran came to the assistance of Father Fournier for four years as provincial (1898-1902). Upon the death of Father Corcoran, Father Fournier again resumed the burden of the provincial direction. Resigning in 1908, he was succeeded by Very Rev. J. A. Charlebois, the present superior. As teaching <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> by word and example is the most important function of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> educator, every catechist of St. Viator is required by the rule to write a complete course of religious instruction. The brother catechists twice every day read selected portions of the <a href="02543a.htm">Holy Scripture</a>, of the <a href="13120c.htm">Catechism of the Council of Trent</a>, and of the <a href="07674c.htm">Following of Christ</a>. Priests and Brothers make daily a half hour meditation on the life of Christ and the virtues of <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>, read regularly <a href="14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works such as the "Christian Perfection" of Rodriguez, hear or say daily Mass, receive <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> daily, and besides morning and evening <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> and beads in common, make a daily visit to the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> or assist at benediction. The community rules require careful personal research in preparation for teaching. The books, <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> classics, published by members of the Congregation range from the elementary reading and spelling books to manuals of belle-lettres, from language primers and the small <a href="05075b.htm">catechism</a> to literary criticism and <a href="01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, from arithmetic to the higher mathematics.</p>
