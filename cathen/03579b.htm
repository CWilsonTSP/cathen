<h1>Chaplain</h1>

<p>(Latin <em>capellanus</em>, from <em>capella</em>, <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>).</p>

<p>The origin of <em>capella</em> has been a fruitful source of controversy. The opinion most favoured is that which <a href="05181b.htm">Du Cange</a> (Gloss. Med. et Inf. Lat.) has drawn from earlier writers, viz. that the word is derived from the <em>capa</em> or <em>capella</em> of <a href="09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>. This was a short cloak preserved as a <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> by the Kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. They carried it with them when they went to <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and on the field enshrined it under a tent. This tent gradually received the name <em>capella</em>, and the custodians of the <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> were thence called <em>capellani</em>. Others think that the word <em>capella</em> simply signifies a covering, and that the name arose from the tent-like structure erected by the kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to canopy the altar for soldiers in the field, and that the word has no relation to the <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of St. Martin.</p>

<h2>Court chaplains</h2>

<p>If the derivation of <em>capella</em> from the <em>capa Sancti Martini</em> be the correct one, we must look for the origin of court chaplains in the <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> who were guardians of the <a href="12734a.htm">sacred relics</a> in royal palaces. Gradually these <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> were empowered to say <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the <a href="11271a.htm">oratories</a> committed to their care, and thence there was but a step to endowing them with <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> for the benefit of those living in the palaces. They became the confessors and instructors of all who frequented the court <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>. When such chaplains had increased to a large number, in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, an arch-chaplain was appointed as their superior. From the time of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> onwards, this latter office was committed to <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and its holder became an important personage in the realm. Not only had he <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> over the chaplains and members of the royal court, but he was also entrusted with the expedition of such <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> concerns as were brought to the cognizance of the sovereign from various parts of his kingdom. Both in the Holy Roman Empire and in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the arch-chaplain or palatine chaplain long held the office of high chancellor of the realm. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the arch-chaplain was also grand almoner. The <a href="13009a.htm">revolution of 1789</a> swept away the office, but it was restored by <a href="12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> in 1857 and lasted to the fall of the Second Empire.</p>

<h2>Beneficed chaplains</h2>

<p>There are a large number of <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> whose <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> it is to say certain prescribed Masses or to procure their celebration, or to take part in various church services, such as choir service. Such <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> received their support from a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> foundation erected for the purpose. Such chaplaincies are called either <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or lay. They are <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> if the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> donated by a founder has been formally erected into a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> by the proper spiritual authority. If however, the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> designed for the purpose of procuring certain acts of Divine service has not received <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> erection it is called a lay chaplaincy. The latter is, strictly speaking, not a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> in the canonical sense of the term. When a founder erects a chaplaincy, he is at liberty to define the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who is to enjoy the benefit of his foundation. Thus he may prescribe that a certain number of Masses be said by the chaplain; he may designate the intention for which they are to be offered, the altar at which they are to be said, and other like prescriptions. He can also determine whether the chaplain is to say the Masses personally or only be responsible for their celebration. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has always been most liberal in confirming the conditions prescribed by such founders and insisting on their due observance. If the testator has left his goods to a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>, with the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of procuring the celebration of certain Masses by any <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> whom he shall choose, such chaplaincy is called mercenary, and it does not partake of the nature of an <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>, as the latter requires generally that the holder should be appointed for life. The controllers of such mercenary chaplaincies can of course be <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>, or even <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> or children. At times the name of lay chaplains is given to such <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. A chaplaincy is called collative if the founder bestows his goods for spiritual purposes in such a way that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to erect the foundation into a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>, for no <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> can erect a sacred edifice or institute a spiritual office without the episcopal authorization. Such <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> are called collative because the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> collates or confers the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to hold them upon the acceptable candidate even if such candidate has been presented or nominated by lay authority. To exclude the episcopal confirmation would be to make it impossible for the chaplaincy to be held as an <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>. Hereditary or <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> chaplaincies are those to which, by the will of the founder, the holder of the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> is to be nominated by the testator's heirs or assigns. In such cases also the confirmation of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is of absolute necessity. If the chaplaincy be attached to a definite edifice or to an altar in that edifice, it may not by <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> be removed to another place. Instances, however, are on record where the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has sanctioned the removal of such chaplaincies from one castle of noble <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> to another, where the request has been made by the heirs of the founders.</p>

<h2>Regulations concerning beneficed chaplains</h2>

<p>When the founder of a chaplaincy has not expressly stipulated that the beneficiary is to celebrate personally the prescribed Masses, it is not requisite that the chaplain be in Sacred orders as he can procure otherwise the celebration of the Masses. If it be an <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a>, however, the incumbent must at least be a <a href="04049b.htm">cleric</a>. When the founder explicitly stipulates that the chaplain is to be a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, the condition must be adhered to. If, however, he says merely that the chaplain is personally to celebrate the stipulated Masses, then the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> can be given to a simple cleric, provided he is of such age that he can receive the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> within a year. If the foundation requires that the chaplain take part in the <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or collegiate church, then personal service is <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on the beneficiary, nor can he employ a substitute, if by obtaining the <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> he becomes a mansionary of that church. In cases where a daily Mass is one of the conditions of the foundation, it is generally held that the chaplain can occasionally intermit this <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> for a proper cause. He can also, if hindered by sickness, omit the application of the daily Mass for a fortnight, without being <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to secure the fulfilment of the foundation requirement by another <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. If the chaplain is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to offer his Mass for a definite intention specified by the founder, he may not receive an <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a> for another intention and satisfy both by the same Mass. As to residence the chaplain's office depends on whether his chaplaincy be lay or <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a>; if lay, he may be arbitrarily removed by the one who has the right of appointment, unless the will of the founder be expressly to the contrary; if <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a>, the chaplain, like all other holders of benefices, is presumably appointed for life, unless the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of foundation provide otherwise.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Parochial or auxiliary chaplains</h2>

<p>This name is given in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> to those <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who render assistance to a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, who cannot care for his whole <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> owing to the large number of the faithful within its confines. The position and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of such <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> chaplains are in many ways analogous to those of vicars and <a href="04570a.htm">curates</a> (see <a href="04570a.htm">CURATE</a>; <a href="15401a.htm">VICAR</a>). The <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> allows <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to appoint the chaplains <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, but in most <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> custom has reserved their appointment to the ordinary. In case the appointment be made by the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> himself, he may delegate the chaplain to perform the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> offices, with the exception of the hearing of confessions. The latter authorization must come from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Chaplains have no fixed powers. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> can make the limitations they judge proper. Whenever they exercise the care of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, it must always be with dependence on the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> as to time and method. They need a special delegation of the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> to assist validly at a marriage. The support of <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> chaplains is to be derived from the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> funds, unless they possess a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> in the church having the annexed <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of assisting the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. In the latter case, they are irremovable. When their faculties have been conferred by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, they do not lose them by the death of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>.</p>

<h2>Domestic chaplains</h2>

<p><a href="02473c.htm">Benefices</a> possessed by chaplains are often attached to the residence of distinguished <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>. In many countries of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, noblemen or their ancestors have provided for the sustenance of such private chaplains. Often such a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> takes on himself the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of instructing the children of the house. If the position of the domestic chaplain be really of the nature of a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a>, it follows the rules already given for <a href="02473c.htm">beneficed</a> chaplains; otherwise the incumbent is considered as an auxiliary chaplain of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> or diocese where he resides.</p>

<h2>Chaplains of convents</h2>

<p>According to various decrees of <a href="13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>, the chaplains of <a href="04340c.htm">nunneries</a> must be men of mature age, if they can be procured. This rule is so strict that if the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> without necessity has appointed a junior to the position, the superior may refuse to receive him. (S.C. Ep., In Messan., 1602.) Chaplains unworthy of their charge are to be immediately removed. As a rule, regulars are not to be appointed chaplains in <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> unless there be a dearth of <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The chaplain receives his faculties from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, except in the case of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> who are subject to some order of regulars. Only in the case of exempt <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> can the chaplain administer all the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to them, to the exclusion of the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. As a rule, <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> chaplains should not be appointed for life. If a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> claims to have the right of presenting an irremovable chaplain to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the latter should forward the claim to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain judgment upon it. If this is favourable, a perpetual chaplain is to be approved.</p>

<p>Chaplains of public institutions, such as colleges, <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a>, etc., receive their power from the intention of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> when appointing them or from the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the foundation if there be one. As a rule they are allowed to say <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> and preach in the community <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, and to exercise various quasiparochial functions for the community.</p>

<h2>Pontifical chaplains</h2>

<p>Attached to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> are various grades of chaplains. The private chaplains are those who assist the pontiff at the altar when he celebrates Mass, and are assisted by the honorary private chaplains, who minister directly to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> only occasionally. There are also the private <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, the common chaplains and the supernumerary chaplains. Honorary chaplains "outside the city" are those who assist the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> only when he is outside <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The honorary private chaplains were instituted by <a href="04030a.htm">Pope Clement XII</a>; the common chaplains by <a href="01294a.htm">Pope Alexander VII</a>. In 1907, <a href="12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> confirmed to the common chaplains the title of <em>Monsignore</em> and their distinctive dress.</p>

<h2>Military chaplains</h2>

<p>Priests appointed to minister to the needs of the army and the navy are commonly called military chaplains. In <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries where the numbers of such chaplains have been large, the governments have usually appointed a chaplain-major. Unless this appointment has been sanctioned by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, such chaplains-major possess no <a href="08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> over the other chaplains. The <a href="09068a.htm">common law</a> of the church is that military chaplains should be approved by the <a href="11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the place, not by the chaplain-major, otherwise confessions and marriages performed by them are invalid. When there are exceptions to this rule, it can only be in virtue of a special <a href="07789a.htm">papal indult</a>. Such <a href="07789a.htm">indults</a> have been granted for various countries. In <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the army has <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> independent of the ordinary. In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> military chaplains have been abolished since the separation of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Chaplains were formerly granted to the French soldiers only when their barracks were far from the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. In 1887, <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> concluded a convention with the <a href="04121b.htm">United States of Columbia</a> in which various privileges for military chaplains were confirmed. In some countries, as <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the chaplains are distinguished into <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="04570a.htm">curates</a>, and assistants. They are subject to an army <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, who generally receives episcopal <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The exemption of military chaplains in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary dates from 1720. For the <a href="05445a.htm">British</a> Army and Navy, a decress was issued by the <a href="12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>, 15 May, 1906. It declares that the <em>pro tempore</em> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a> is the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior of all commissioned army and navy chaplains. As regards the former, he is to treat with the Government concerning their <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a>, and take such measures as he shall deem expedient for their spiritual well-being. They are to report to him semi-annually, or at least annually, whatever concerns their state and occupation. Commissioned chaplains (except in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>) are to receive exclusively from the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> the faculties which he may grant them in virtue of his ordinary or delegated <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. These faculties they may exercise in the place determined by the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, in favour only of the soldiers, their wives, and <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>. When a chaplain is transferred, his faculties endure until he has taken charge of his new station; but as soon as he receives notice of his transfer, he must inform the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of it. As to their conduct as <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> these chaplains are subject to the local ordinary, to whom their special faculties must be shown, though his consent is not needed for their exercise so long as it is not extended to civilians.</p>

<p>On retirement from a chaplaincy in the army, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> must return to his former diocese. In South Africa the local <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> are to supply the place of chaplains as far as possible. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a> alone is to treat with the Government for the appointment of navy chaplains, and is to grant them faculties which may be used in any part of the world, but only on shipboard. If, however, by the arrangement of the commander of a ship, it be <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the chaplain to exercise his faculties on land, he must if possible notify the <a href="11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the place, not to obtain authorization, but simply to show proper deference, except in the case that the exercises his functions for others than the members of the navy, for them he is <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to have recourse to the <a href="11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the place where he is (<a href="01111c.htm">Acta S. Sedis</a>, Vol. XL, fasc. 5). In <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> the military chaplains are subject to the local <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a> in 1853 requires that army chaplains report to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at stated times the religious condition of those under their charge. In the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> Army probably the first chaplains commissioned by the Government were those appointed during the Mexican War. At present the Government appoints a limited number of chaplains for the army and navy. To administer the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to soldiers in garrison, army chaplains need the <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the ordinary; when the soldiers are mobilized, chaplains may exercise their functions anywhere without such authorization. Navy chaplains (cf. Smith, op. cit. infra.) seem to fall under the general law that faculties must be obtained from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the port whence the vessel sails. However by the general <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of 4 April, 1900, they would have faculties on shipboard from the mere fact that they were approved by their own proper ordinaries.</p>
