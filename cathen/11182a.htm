<h1>Religious Obedience</h1>

<p>Religious obedience is that general submission which religious <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> promise to their superiors, in order to be directed by them in the ways of perfection according to the purpose and constitutions of their order. It consists, according to <a href="09192a.htm">Lessius</a> (De Justitia, II, xlvi, 37), in a man's allowing himself to be governed throughout his life by another for the sake of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. It is composed of three elements:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the sacrifice offered to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of his own independence in the generality of his actions, at least of such as are exterior;</li><li>the motive, namely, personal perfection, and, as a rule, also the performance of spiritual or corporal works of mercy and charity;</li><li>the express or implied contract with an order (formerly also with a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>), which accepts the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to lead him to the end for which he accepts its <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and direction. </li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Religious obedience, therefore, does not involve that extinction of all individuality, so often alleged against <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; nor is it unlimited, for it is not possible either physically or morally that a man should give himself up absolutely to the guidance of another. The choice of a superior, the object of obedience, the authority of the hierarchical Church, all exclude the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of arbitrary rule.</p>

<h2 id="section1">The canonical rule of obedience</h2>

<h3 id="A">The superiors</h3>

<p>By <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, religious <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> are subject to the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; first to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, then to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, unless exempted by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> from episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. This <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was instituted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> in order to direct the faithful not only in the way of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but also in <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>. The <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience in the institutes approved by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is held more and more to be made equally to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who communicates his authority to the <a href="13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a> entrusted with the direction of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The superiors of the different orders, when they are <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> and exempt from episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, similarly receive a part of this authority and every one who is placed at the head of a community is invested with the domestic authority <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for its good government; the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> by which the religious offers to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> the obedience which he promises to his superiors confirms and defines this authority. But the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to demand obedience in virtue of the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> does not necessarily belong to all superiors; it is ordinarily reserved to the head of the community; and in order to enforce the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a>, it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the superior should make known his intention to bind the <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>; in certain orders such expressions as "I will", "I command", have not such binding force. The instructions of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> require that the power of binding the <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> by command shall be employed with the utmost <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and discretion.</p>

<h3 id="B">The limits of the obligation</h3>

<p>The commands of superiors do not extend to what concerns the inward motion of the will. Such at least is the teaching of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/3106.htm#article5">II-II.106.5</a> and <a href="../summa/3186.htm#article2">II-II.186.2</a>). Obedience is not vowed absolutely, and without limit, but according to the rule of each order, for a superior cannot command anything foreign to, or outside, the rule (except in so far as he may grant <a href="05041a.htm">dispensations</a> from the rule). No appeal lies from his order, that is to say, the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of obedience is not suspended by any appeal to higher authority; but the inferior has always the right of extra-judicial recourse to a higher authority in the order or to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2">The moral significance</h2>

<p>The religious is bound morally to obey on all occasions when he is bound canonically, and whenever his disobedience would offend against the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of charity, as for instance by bringing discord into the community. By reason of the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience and of the <a href="12451b.htm">religious profession</a> a deliberate act of obedience and submission adds the merit of an act of the virtue of religion to the other merits of the act. This extends even to the obedience of a counsel which goes beyond matters of regular observance, and is also limited by the prescriptions of higher <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> whether human or Divine.</p>

<h2 id="section3">The foundation</h2>

<h3 id="A">Evangelical</h3>

<p>The evangelical foundation of religious obedience is first of all found in the perfect accord of that obedience with the spirit of the Gospel. Freedom from <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> which leads a man to choose a position of inferiority, implies a spirit of <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> which esteems others as superior, and willingly yields them the first place; the sacrifice of his own independence and his own will presupposes in a high degree that spirit of self-denial and <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> which keeps the passions under proper restraint; the readiness to accept a common rule and direction manifests a spirit of union and concord which generously adapts itself to the desires and tastes of others; eagerness to do the will of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in all things is a mark of the charity towards <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> which led Christ to say "I do always the things which please my Father" (<a href="../bible/joh007.htm#vrs29">John 7:29</a>). And since the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has invested superiors with her authority, religious obedience is supported by all those texts which recommend submission to lawful powers, and especially by the following: "He that heareth you, heareth me" (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs16">Luke 10:16</a>).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3 id="B">Philosophical</h3>

<p>Philosophically religious obedience is justified (a) by the experience of the mistakes and illusions to which a man relying on his own unaided opinions is liable. The religious proposes to rule his whole life by devotion to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and his neighbour; how shall he best realize this ideal? By regulating all his actions by his own judgment, or by choosing a prudent and enlightened guide who will give his advice without any consideration of himself? Is it not clear that the latter alternative shows a resolution more sincere, more generous, and at the same time more likely to lead to a successful issue? This obedience is justified also (b) by the help of example and counsel afforded by community life and the acceptance of a rule of conduct, the <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of which is vouched for by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; (c) lastly, since the object of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders is not only the perfection of their members, but also the performance of spiritual and corporal works of mercy, they need a union of efforts which can only be assured by religious obedience, just as military obedience is indispensable for success in the operations of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>.</p>

<p>Religious obedience never reduces a man to a state of passive inertness, it does not prevent the use of any faculty he may possess, but sanctifies the use of all. It does not forbid any initiative, but subjects it to a prudent control in order to preserve it from indiscretion and keep it in the line of <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> charity. A member of a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order has often been compared to a dead body, but in <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> nothing is killed by the religious <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> by vanity and self-love and all their fatal opposition to the Divine will. If superiors and subjects have sometimes failed to understand the practice of religious obedience, if direction has sometimes been indiscreet, these are accidental imperfections from which human institution is not free. The unbounded <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of men like <a href="06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> and other <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> who <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> their rule, the prominent part which religious have taken in the mission field, and their successes therein, at all times waged against the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; all these things furnish the most eloquent testimony to the <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> influence of religious obedience in developing the activity which it sanctifies. The expression "blind obedience" signifies not an unreasoning or unreasonable submission to authority, but a keen appreciation of the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of authority, the reasonableness of submission, and blindness only to such selfish or worldly considerations as would lessen regard for authority.</p>

<p>At present, religious have taken a far greater part than formerly in civil and public life, personally fulfilling all the conditions required of citizens, in order to exercise their right of voting and other functions compatible with their profession. Obedience does not interfere with the proper exercise of such <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. No political system rejects the votes of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> in dependent positions, but all freely permit the use of any legitimate influence which corrects to some extent the vicious tendency of equalitarianism: the influence of religious superiors is limited to safeguarding the higher interests of religion. As to the functions to be fulfilled, the superior, by the very fact of permitting his subjects to undertake them, grants all the liberty that is required for their honourable fulfillment.</p>

<h3 id="C">Historical</h3>

<p>Though <a href="11590b.htm">St. Paul</a> and the other early <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> were not in a position to practice religious obedience, it was already manifested in the docility with which their imitators placed themselves under the guidance of some older man. <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, in his letter "De habitu virginum", shows us that at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the virgins followed the direction of the older <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. Obedience was then looked upon as sort of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, from which those were dispenses who were considered perfect and ripe for a solitary life. This <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is found also in the first chapter of the <a href="02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. <a href="11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> (A.D. 292-346) understanding the importance of obedience in community life made it the foundation of the <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the cenobites, preaching by his own example, and inculcating upon all superiors the necessity of a scrupulous observance of the rules of which they were the guardians. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> (cf. Cassian, "Institutions") thus saw in perfect obedience an excellent application of their universal spirit of self-renunciation. Later, <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> insisted on the complete suppression of self-will, i.e., of that will which sets itself in opposition to the designs of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and to all that is commanded or desired for the good of the community. The obedience of the Eastern <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> was imperfect and defective by reason of the facility with which they changed from one superior or <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> to another. St. Benedict, in consequence, advancing a step farther, introduced a new rule binding his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> by a <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability. A certain choice of rules still existed, which seemed likely to be hurtful to the common life, for some <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> had various sets of rules, each set having its own observants. The reforms in the Order of St. Benedict brought into existence monastic congregations known by the identity of their observances, and these were the forerunners of the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> with their rules which have become canonical <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>. <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> thus had before him all the material <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to enable him to treat fully of the subject of religious obedience in his "Summa Theologica", in which he makes it clear that the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience is the chief of the <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion.</p>
