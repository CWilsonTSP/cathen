<p><a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Posen, born 11 Nov., 1774, in the village of Wat near the city of Rawa, <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>; died 26 Dec., 1842. in the city of Posen. He studied <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the Collegium Germanicum at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1793-97), and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in Sept., 1797. After some service in the Diocese of Cracow, he was made a canon of Wloclawek by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cujavia, in 1808 canon of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, in 1815 chancellor of its <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, in 1824 canon of Posen and counsellor to the Government in matters of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. On the death of Archbishop Theophilus von Wolicki (1829) Von Dunin became administrator of the Archdiocese of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Posen, was appointed <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in 1831, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 10 July of the same year. He endeavoured at once to reorganize his vast diocese, a work rendered <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the vicissitudes of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> in the eighteenth century, the consequent reunion of the Dioceses of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Posen, and the secularization or suppression of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. He reconstructed on a new plan the <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a> of <a href="06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Posen, travelled throughout the two <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> administering the Sacrament of Confirmation and dedicating new churches, and discharged faithfully the other <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of his pastoral ministry. In the exercise of these <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> he came into conflict with the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government on the question of <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>. The conditions laid down by <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1740-58) in the Constitution "Magn&aelig; nobis" (29 June, 1748), by which marriages between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and members of other <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> became lawful, had been well observed in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>. But in a treaty concluded in 1768 with various <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> powers the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government undertook to enforce another order of things. Mixed marriages were no longer forbidden; male children born of such marriages were to be brought up in the religion of their father, the <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> offspring in that of the mother. The marriage was to be <a href="02599b.htm">blessed</a> by the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> minister, under whose <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> the bride was; if a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> should refuse to solemnize the marriage, the minister of the other party was to officiate. Similar provisions were contained in the code of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> law extended to <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1797. By a royal decree of King Frederick William III (1797-1840), 21 Nov., 1803, they were further modified in an anti-Catholic sense: all the children of <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> were to be raised in the religion of the father.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Such legislation was unquestionably hostile to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. It often happened, therefore, that <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> blessed <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> without first requiring the usual promise concerning the free exercise of religion for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party and the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of all offspring in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were silent; both <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> seemed to believe that they must endure what they could not prevent. Penalties were inflicted by the Government on all <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who refused to <a href="02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> contracted without any of the above conditions. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> was finally aroused by the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Litteris altero abhinc" of <a href="12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> (1829-30), 25 March, 1830, forbidding <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="02599b.htm">bless</a> a <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a> if no promise were given relating to the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the children in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. In case of such refusal <a href="12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> agreed to tolerate a passive assistance (<em>assistentia passiva</em>) on the part of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. Realizing the harm done to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion by the lax practice observed so far, Archbishop Von Dunin resolved to break with it. In January, 1837, he requested from the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs in Berlin permission to publish the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a>, or at least to direct his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to obey its provisions. His request was refused. A petition sent directly to Frederick William III, 26 Oct., 1837, was similarly treated. Determined not to betray his high office he sent an instruction to his <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, 30 Jan., 1838, in which he inculcated the principles of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> relating to <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>; Soon after (27 Feb.) he suspended <em>ipso facto</em> any <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> who should henceforth <a href="02599b.htm">bless</a> a <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a> without previous assurance as to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the offspring. The king was notified of these acts, 10 March, 1838. While the instructions of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> were well received throughout his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the Government was highly indignant and sought by all means to render them ineffectual. They were declared null and void; the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was asked to recall them, and finally (in July, 1838) a regular trial was commenced against him in the Court of Posen, to which, however, he always objected as conducted by a non-competent authority. In the midst of this struggle he received much consolation from the unanimous support of his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and from an Allocution in his favour by <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, 13 Sept., 1838. At the conclusion of his trial in 1839 he was summoned to Berlin where he arrived 5 April. A last ineffectual attempt was made to have him recant; finally the sentence of the court proclaiming his deposition from office, inability ever to hold one, and a confinement of six months in a fortress, was read to him. He appealed directly to the king for clemency, but nothing was changed except that he was detained in Berlin instead of being sent to a fortress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> began to think of the needs of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and being unable to obtain permission to return, he departed secretly from <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and arrived in Posen, 4 October. In less than two days, during the night of 5-6 Oct., he was arrested and taken to the fortress of Colberg, where he remained until the death of Frederick William III (7 June, 1840). After his departure the diocese put on public mourning; the bells and the <a href="11297a.htm">organs</a> remained silent during the celebration of the Holy Mysteries; on all <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days public <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> were said for the speedy return of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>; and both the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the nobility of Posen made several fruitless attempts to obtain his release. With the accession of the peaceful king, Frederick William IV (1840-61), matters changed. On 3 Aug., 1840, Von Dunin was set free, and on the 5th of the same month he arrived in Posen amid the rejoicing of his faithful flock. According to an agreement reached with the Government he issued a pastoral letter, 25 Aug., in which his previous instructions were somewhat modified, without detriment, however, to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principle. He recommended his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> not to insist absolutely on the fulfilment of the usual conditions required for <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, but at the same time to abstain from all active participation in such <a href="09707a.htm">marriages</a>, if the usual promises were not given. No mention was made of any punishment in the case of contravention. Later on (21 Feb., and 26 Sept., 1842) he issued new instructions relating to the manner of dealing in confession with the husband or wife of a <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriage</a>. The <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> were directed to be indulgent towards those who tried their best to influence their children in favour of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and to distinguish them from those who were altogether careless in the discharge of this sacred <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>. With this the whole controversy ceased. Archbishop Von Dunin did not long survive these conflicts. His memory is held in respect for his unswerving loyalty to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles, and for his <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, frankness, and prudent moderation displayed in their defence.</p>
