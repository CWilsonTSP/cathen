<p><a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of the <a href="10069b.htm">Congregation of Saint-Maur</a>, born at Saint-Pierremont between Mouzon and the Chartreuse of Mont-Dieu in Champagne, 23 November, 1632; died at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 27 December, 1707. He was the fifth child of Estienne Mabillon, a peasant who died in 1692, aged 104, and of his wife, Jeanne Gu&eacute;rin, descended, through her mother's <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, from a branch of the seigneurs of Saint-Pierremont. Jean was a precocious child, and easily surpassed his <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> companions in their studies, while his pleasant disposition made him a general favourite. At the age of nine he was sent to his uncle, Jean Mabillon, then <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at Neufville, by whom he was well instructed in the "rudiments", and from whom he received a donation to enable him to continue his studies. In 1644 Jean was sent to the Coll&egrave;ge des Bons Enfants at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Here, while studying at the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, he lived, half as pupil, half as servant, in the house of Cl&eacute;ment Boucher canon of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and commendatory <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Tenaiues. This patron, in 1650, procured him admission to the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, where he remained for three years. In 1653, however, the <a href="13506d.htm">scandalous</a> conduct and death of the uncle who had befriended him made the vocation to the <a href="13675a.htm">secular priesthood</a> distasteful to him, and he withdrew from the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. After less than a month of retirement, on 29 August, he became a <a href="12319b.htm">postulant</a> in the Abbey of St-Remu at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. This house had, since 1627, belonged to the reformed <a href="10069b.htm">Maurist Congregation</a> (see <a href="10069b.htm">CONGREGATION OF MAURISTS</a>). He was clothed on 5 September, and, after his year's <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, was professed on 6 September 1654. His devotion to the strict observance, to <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> and to study, was so great that his superiors entrusted him with the direction and teaching of the <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>. But the eagerness with which he endeavoured to fulfil his office was greater than his health could endure- he began to suffer from violent headaches and soon became incapable even of reciting his Office. In 1656, his superiors, in the hope that entire rest might restore his health, sent him to Nogent, whence, in July, 1658, he was transferred to the famous Abbey of Corbie. Here, as at Nogent, he occupied his time in the study of antiquities, while holding successively the offices of porter, of <em>depositarius</em>, and of cellarer. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a> in 1660. The tranquil life restored his health and, in 1663, he was transferred to the Abbey of St-Denis, where he became treasurer. But his superiors had already noticed his great gifts and, in 1664, at the request of Dom D'Ach&eacute;ry (q.v.), he was removed to the Abbey of St-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, where he lived for the rest of his life.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>When Mabillon first entered its precincts, the <a href="04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a> was John Casimir, King of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, an eccentric <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> whose irregular life had but little effect on his <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>; the claustral prior was Dom Ignatius Philibert, and D'Ach&eacute;ry was custodian of its wonderful <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> to which the young <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> was introduced at St-Germain was, perhaps, the most learned of its time in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Every week, on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, there met in D'Ach&eacute;ry's room a group of savants that included men like <a href="05181b.htm">Du Cange</a>, <a href="02242a.htm">Baluze</a>, d'Herbelot, Cotelier, <a href="12769a.htm">Renaudot</a>, Fleury, Lamy, Pagi, <a href="14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>. Mabillon soon became a brilliant member of this group of noted workers. D'Ach&eacute;ry had asked for him to help him in his projected "Lives of the Benedictine Saints", but the first work entrusted to his care was that of editing the works of <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>. This was published within three years (1667), and was at once recognized as a masterly edition. Meanwhile Mabillon had been arranging the materials already brought together by D'Achery, and the first volume of the "Acta Sanctorum, O.S.B." was published in 1668. A second volume appeared the following year, a third in 1672. The scholarly conscientiousness and critical methods of Mabillon were a source of <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> to some of his less instructed fellow-monks, and in 1677 a petition, <a href="15446a.htm">violently</a> attacking the "Acta Sanctorum O.S.B.", was presented to the general chapter of the congregation, demanding the suppression of the work (as harmful to the interests of Benedictinism) and an apology from its author. Mabillon defended himself with such <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> combined with firmness and learning that all opposition was overcome, and he was encouraged to continue. Meanwhile, in 1672, he had already made the first of those "literary journeys" (this time into <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>), in search of documents and materials for his work, that were so marked a feature of the other half of his life, and which had such fruitful results for history and liturgy. In 1675 was published the first of four volumes of "Vetera Analecta" in which he collected the fruit of his travels and some shorter works of historical importance.</p>

<p>But 1675 saw also the occasion of his greatest work. To the second volume of the "Acta SS." for April Daniel Papebroch had prefixed a "Propylaeum antiquarium", which was really a first attempt to formulate rules for the discernment of spurious from genuine documents. Therein he had instanced as spurious some famous charters in the Abbey of St-Denis. Mabillon was appointed to draw up a defence of these documents, and he made his defence the occasion of a statement of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> principles of documentary criticism. This is the volume, "De re diplomatica" (1681), a treatise so masterly that it remains today the foundation of the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of diplomatics. Papebroch himself readily admitted that he had been confuted by this treatise, though an attempt was made some time later by Germon to disprove Mabillon's theory, thereby provoking a reply from Mabillon in his "Supplementum" of 1704. The admiration excited amongst the learned by Mabillon's great book was widespread. <a href="04096a.htm">Colbert</a> offered its author a pension of 2000 livres, which Mabillon declined, while requesting <a href="04096a.htm">Colbert's</a> continued protection for his <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 1682 Mabillon was sent by <a href="04096a.htm">Colbert</a> into <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to examine certain ancient documents relative to the royal house; and in 1683 he was sent with Dom Michel Germain, at the king's expense, on a journey throughout <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in search of materials for the <a href="07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> or of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. During this expedition, which took five months to accomplish, <a href="04096a.htm">Colbert</a> died and was succeeded as minister by Le Tellier, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, who also greatly admired Mabillon. At the instance of this <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> the king, in 1685, required Mabillon to make a tour through the <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> for the purpose of acquiring books and <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> for the Royal Library. More than 3000 rare and valuable volumes were procured. During his travels Mabillon was everywhere received with the utmost <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>. Soon after his return he began his famous controversy with De Ranc&eacute;, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of La Trappe, who had denied that it was lawful for <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> to devote themselves to study rather than to manual labour. Mabillon's "Trait&ecirc; des &eacute;tudes monastiques" (1691) was a noble defence of monastic learning and laid down the lines that it should follow. De Ranc&eacute; replied, and Mabillon was forced to publish further "R&eacute;flexions sur la R&eacute;ponse de M. l'Abb&eacute; de la Trappe" (1692) . De Ranc&eacute; would have carried the dispute further, but Cardinal le Camus interfered, and the general opinion seems to have been that both parties to the dispute were really in substantial agreement: Mabillon being an instance of regular devotion combined with prodigious learning, de Ranc&eacute; showing by his writings that learning was not incompatible with devotion to monastic strictness.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1698 a storm was raised in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the publication by Mabillon, under the name of "Eusebius Romanus", of a protest against the <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a> veneration of the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of "unknown <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>" from the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. This work was denounced to the Holy Office, and Mabillon was compelled to explain and modify certain passages. In 1700 arose another storm. The <a href="10069b.htm">Maurists</a>, in spite of the difficulties arising from the current controversies on <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, had determined to publish a critical edition of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. To the last volume of this edition Mabillon was required to furnish a preface, defending the methods and critical conclusions of its editors. His first draft was submitted to various critics, and, after receiving their annotations, was rewritten and sent to <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> for his opinion. It was largely amended by <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and returned to Mabillon to be rewritten. The result is the "Preface" of the eleventh volume as we now have it. Mabillon now retired to Normandy to avoid the clamour that, as he expected, was aroused by its publication. But the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> supported the <a href="10069b.htm">Maurists</a>, and though the extremists endeavoured to tax the more moderate with <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> they were silenced by the supreme authority. Mabillon did not lack enemies. In 1698 they had spread a report that he had <a href="01624b.htm">apostatized</a> in <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and he felt <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to write to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> denying the charge. But, as his life drew to a close, all men came to recognize his genius and integrity. In 1701 the king appointed him one of the first members of the new Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Inscriptions. Two years later appeared the first volume of the "Annales O.S.B.", on which he had been engaged since 1693. He lived to see but four volumes published. In 1707, as he was on his way to Chelles, he fell sick. He was carried back to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> and after three weeks' illness, on 27 December having heard Mass at midnight and received <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, he died. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in the Lady <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> at St-Germain. At the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> in 1798, when the Lady <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St-Germain was destroyed, the simple <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the great historian was removed to the garden of the Musee des Petits-Augustins. At the Restoration, however, it was carried back to St-Germain, where it still remains behind the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a>.</p>
