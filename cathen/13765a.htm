<p>Siam, "the land of the White Elephant" or the country of the <em>Muang Thai</em> (the Free), is situated in the south-eastern corner of <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>, lying between 4&#176; and 21&#176; north lat. and 97&#176; and 106&#176; east long. It is bounded on the north by Tong-king and the southern states of <a href="03082a.htm">Burma</a>, on the east by Annam and Cambodia, on the south by the Gulf of Siam and the Malay Peninsula, and on the west by the Indian Ocean, and thus forms a buffer state between French and British possessions. From north to south Siam measures in length some 1130 and in breadth some 508 miles, covering an area of some 242,580 square miles, about the size of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and is divided into 41 provinces. Its population is estimated to be between six and nine million inhabitants, of whom a third are Siamese, a quarter Chinese or of <a href="03663b.htm">Chinese</a> descent, whilst the rest is made up of Burmese, Cambodians, Laotines, Malays, Pegus, Tamils, and <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a>. The Siamese are described as a polite, hospitable, <a href="11189a.htm">obliging</a>, light-hearted, pleasure and feast-loving people, as clever gold and silversmiths, possessing great taste for art and skill as <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a>, decorators, and carvers in wood, stone, plaster, and <a href="10584a.htm">mosaic</a>. They are, however, not fond of work nor is it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for them to be so, for they have few wants for housing and food, fire and clothing, and mother earth has endowed them with a perpetual summer and a fertile soil, yielding rich harvests of rice and pepper, whilst the mountains abound in teak and yellow wood, box and ebony, sapan and padoo. The chief commerce is in silk, which is carried on along the Menam River and its numerous affluents and canals. The state religion is <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, which, according to the earliest annals, was introduced as far back as 638. With perhaps the exception of <a href="14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, there is no country in the East where <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> is so intensely interwoven with the life of a nation from the king to the lowest subject, and where the talapoins or bonzes play such an important r&ocirc;le in the national life, so that every male subject, the king and the crown prince not excepted, has to live in a <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and join the ranks of the talapoins for a short period. Up to a few years ago these <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were the only establishments for <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, which were restricted to the male population. Though <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> is the acknowledged religion of the state and towards it the Government allows some $20,000,000 yearly, all other religious creeds are granted full liberty of worship, nor does any one incur disabilities on account of his religious <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. The king, being the highest "supporter of the doctrine", stands at the head of the religion and appoints all religious dignitaries, from the four <em>Somdet Phra Chow Rajagana</em> (archpriests) downwards.</p>

<p>Little is <a href="08673a.htm">known</a> about the early history of the country. It was first called Siam by the Portuguese (1511) and other nations who came into contact with it. Before Ayuthia or Yuthia was established as the capital (1350), the country was divided into a number of separate principalities bound together by race, language, religion, and customs. A continual migration from the north to the south took place till in 1350 a branch of the Thai race established itself at Ayuthia. The history of Siam as a dominant power begins with Phra-Chao Utong Somdetch Pra Rama Tibaudi I (1351-71) and it was ruled by thirty-four kings (1351-1767) belonging to three different dynasties. During the inroads of the Burmese (1767-82), Ayuthia was destroyed and the new Siamese capital was established at Bangkok, "the <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> of the East". As early as 1511 the <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> made a commercial treaty with Siam and subsequently the <a href="08297a.htm">Japanese</a>, the <a href="10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, and the British entered into commercial relations with it. But the present flourishing commercial condition only dates from 1851, when King Mongkut opened Siam to <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a> and to <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> trade, favoured <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> factories, and made himself acquainted with Western civilization. After his death in 1868, his eldest son, Chulalongkorn (d. 1910), succeeded as the fortieth ruler of Siam, and during a reign of forty-two years showed himself one of the greatest and most farseeing princes who ever sat on an <a href="01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> throne, a king of <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and manners, to whose energy and initiative Siam owes much of her prosperity, railways, telegraphs, army (20,000 men), navy (37 ships, 15,000 men), and <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> for both sexes. Siam has so far been able to maintain her national independence, owing to the rivalry of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The latter has tried ever since the days of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> to obtain a footing in Siam and has actually gained large concessions of territory by the treaties of 1891, 1893, 1904, and 1907, nor has <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> lacked her share (1909).</p>

<p>The first historical record of an attempt to introduce <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> we owe to John Peter Maffei who states that about 1550 a French <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Bonferre, hearing of the great kingdom of the Peguans and the Siamese in the East, went on a Portuguese ship from <a href="06602a.htm">Goa</a> to Cosme (Peguan), where for three years he preached the Gospel, but without any result. In 1552 <a href="06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, writing from Sancian to his friend Diego Pereira, expressed his desire to go to Siam, but his death on 2 December, 1552, prevented him. In 1553 several Portuguese ships landed in Siam, and at the request of the king three hundred Portuguese soldiers entered his service. In the following year two <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Fathers Hieronymus of the Cross and Sebastian de Cant&ugrave;, joined them as <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. In a short time they established three <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> at Ayuthia with some fifteen hundred converted Siamese. Both missionaries, however, were <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> (1569), and were replaced by Fathers Lopez Cardoso, John Madeira, Alphonsus Ximenes, Louis Fonseca (<a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 1600), and John <a href="09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a> (d. 1598). In 1606 the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Balthasar de Sequeira at the request of the <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> merchant Tristan Golayo, and in 1624 Father Julius Cesar Margico, came to Ayuthia and gained the favour of the king. A subsequent <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, however, stopped the propagation of the Faith and no missionary entered till Siam was made a <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> by <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> on 22 August, 1662. Soon after, Mgr Pierre de la Motte-Lambert, Vicar-Apostolic of Cochin China, arrived at Ayuthia, accompanied by Fathers De Bourges and Deydier. In 1664 he was joined by Mgr Pallu, <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Tong King. Siam, in those days the rendezvous of all commercial enterprise in the East, gave shelter to several hundred Annamite and <a href="08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had been expelled or lived there as <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> exiles on account of persecutions at home. Some Portuguese and <a href="14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and Augustinians had the spiritual care of their countrymen in Siam. Mgr Pallu, on his return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1665), obtained a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> from <a href="04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> (4 July, 1669), by which the Vicariate of Siam was entrusted to the newly-founded <a href="14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1673 Father Laneau was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10234c.htm">Metellopolis</a> and first <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Siam, and ever since Siam has been under the spiritual care of the <a href="14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a>. King Phra-Nara&iuml; (1657-83?) gave the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries a hearty welcome, and made them a gift of land for a church, a mission-house, and a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> (St. Joseph's colony). Through the influence of the Greek or <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a>, Constantine Phaulcon, prime minister to King Phra-Nara&iuml;, the latter sent a diplomatic embassy to <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> in 1684. The French king returned the compliment by sending M. de Chaumont, accompanied by some <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> under Fathers de Fontenay and Tachard. On 10 December, 1685, King Phra-Nara&iuml; signed a treaty at Louvo with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, wherein he allowed the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries to preach the Gospel throughout Siam, exempted his <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects from work on Sunday, and appointed a special mandarin to settle disputes between <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>. But after the departure of M. De Chaumont, a Siamese mandarin, Phra-phret-racha, got up a revolution, the prime minister was <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>, King Phra-Nara&iuml; deposed, Mgr Laneau and several missionaries were taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoners</a> and ill-treated, and the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>When in 1690 peace and order were restored, Bishop Laneau resumed work till his death in 1696. His successor, Bishop Louis of Cice (1700-27), was able to continue it in peace. But after his death the rest of the century is but the history of persecutions (those of 1729, 1755, 1764 are the most notable), either by local mandarins or Burmese invaders, though the kings remained more or less favourable to the missionaries and to Bishops Texier de Kerlay and de Loli&egrave;re-Puycontat (1755). During the inroads of the Burmese the Siamese king even appealed to Bishop Brigot for help against the common foe, who sacked and burned the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> stations and colleges and <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> both the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the missionaries. In 1769 Father Corre resumed the missions in Siam and thus paved the way for the new <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Mgr Lebon (1772-80). But a fresh <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> in 1775 forced him to leave the kingdom, and both his successors, Bishops Cond&eacute; and Garnault, were unable to do much. During the Burmese <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were reduced from 12,000 to 1000, while Bishop Florens was left in charge with only seven native <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. It was only in 1826 and 1830 that a fresh supply of <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries arrived, among them Fathers Bouchot, Barbe, Brugui&egrave;re, Vachal, Grandjean, Pallegoix, Courvezy, etc. In 1834 the last was appointed <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Siam, and the missions began to revive. Under him Siam numbered 6590 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 11 <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> and 7 native <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. His successor, Bishop Pallegoix (1840-62), author of "D&eacute;scription du royaume Thai ou Siam" and "Dictionnaire siamois-latin-fran&ccedil;ais-anglais" (30,000 words), was one of the most distinguished <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of Siam, the best Siamese scholar, and a missionary among the Laotines. He induced <a href="10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> to renew the French alliance with Siam and to send an embassy under M. de Montigny to Siam in 1856. On 8 July, 1856, King Mongkut signed a political-commercial treaty with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, by which the privileges granted to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries by Phra-Nara&iuml; in the seventeenth century were renewed. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was highly esteemed by the king, who personally assisted at his funeral and accepted from the missionaries as a token of friendship the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> ring. Thanks to the broad-mindedness of Kings Mongkut (1851-68) and Chulalongkorn (1868-1910), the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in Siam has enjoyed peace under Pallegoix's successors, Bishops Dupont (1862-72) and Vey (1875-1909). Owing to the complications between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and Siam, in 1894, the missionaries had to endure the ill-will of local mandarins, though the minister of foreign affairs promised that no harm would be done to the missionaries and their work on account of the French invasion. Though the mission in Laos, commenced in 1876, formally opened in 1883, and erected into a <a href="15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> on 4 May, 1899, is now separated from Siam, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions have made great progress during the last thirty-five years.
