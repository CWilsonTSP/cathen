<p>Heretical <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> founded in A.D. 144 at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Marcion and continuing in the West for 300 years, but in the East some centuries longer, especially outside the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. They rejected the writings of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and taught that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not the <a href="14142b.htm">Son</a> of the <a href="08329a.htm">God of the Jews</a>, but the Son of the good God, who was different from the God of the Ancient Covenant. They anticipated the more consistent <a href="05169a.htm">dualism</a> of <a href="09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a> and were finally absorbed by it. As they arose in the very infancy of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and adopted from the beginning a strong <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, parallel to that of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, they were perhaps the most dangerous foe <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has ever known. The subject will be treated under the following heads:</p>

<blockquote><p>I. Life of Marcion; <br>II. Doctrine and Discipline; <br>III. History; <br>IV. Mutilation of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; <br>V. Anti-Marcionite Writers. </p></blockquote>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section1">Life of Marcion</h2>

<p>Marcion was son of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14014b.htm">Sinope</a> in <a href="12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, born c. A.D. 110, evidently from wealthy <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>. He is described as <em>nautes, nauclerus</em>, a ship owner, by Rhodon and <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, who wrote about a generation after his death. Epiphanius (Haeres., XLII, ii) relates that Marcion in his youth professed to lead a life of chastity and asceticism, but, in spite of his professions, fell into <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> with a young maiden. In consequence his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, cast him out of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He besought his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> for reconciliation, i.e. to be admitted to <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penance, but the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> stood firm in his refusal. Not being able to bear with the laughter and contempt of his fellow townsmen, he secretly left Sinope and traveled to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The story of Marcion's <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is rejected by many modern scholars (e.g. G. Kr&uuml;ger) as a piece of malicious gossip of which they say Epiphanius was fond; others see in the young maiden but a metaphor for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the then young bride of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom Marcion violated by his <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, though he made great professions of bodily chastity and austerity. No accusations of impurity are brought against Marcion by earlier Church writers, and Marcion's austerity seems acknowledged as a fact. <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> states that Marcion flourished under Pope Anicetus (c. 155-166) [<em>invaluit sub Aniceto</em>]. Though this period may mark Marcion's greatest success in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that he arrived there earlier, I. c. A.D. 140 after the death of Hyginus, who died that year and apparently before the accession of <a href="12126b.htm">Pius I</a>. Epiphanius says that Marcion sought admittance into the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> but was refused. The reason given was that they could not admit one who had been expelled by his own <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> without previous communication with that authority. The story has likewise been pointed out as extremely unlikely, implying, as it does, that the great <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> professed itself incompetent to override the decision of a local <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. It must be borne in mind, however, that Marcion arrived at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> <em>sede vacante</em>, "after the death of <a href="07593a.htm">Hyginus</a>", and that such an answer sounds natural enough on the lips of <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a> as yet without a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is obvious that Marcion was already a <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> could not have disputed on Scripture with the <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a> as he did, nor have threatened shortly after his arrival: "I will divide your Church and cause within her a division, which will last forever", as Marcion is said to have done; a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> could not have founded a vast and worldwide institution, of which the main characteristic was that it was episcopalian; a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> would not have been proudly referred to for centuries by his disciples as their first <em><a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a></em>, a claim not disputed by any of their adversaries, though many and extensive works were written against them; a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> would not have been permanently cast out of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> without hope of reconciliation by his own father, notwithstanding his entreaties, for a <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> of fornication, nor thereafter have become an object of laughter to his <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> fellow townsmen, if we accept the story of Epiphanius. A <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> would not have been disappointed that he was not made <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> shortly after his arrival in a city whose see was vacant, as Marcion is said to have been on his arrival at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> after the death of Hyginus.</p>

<p>This story has been held up as the height of absurdity and so it would be, if we ignored the facts that Marcion was a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that according to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De Praeser., xxx) he made the Roman community the gift of two hundred thousand sesterces soon after his arrival. this extraordinary gift of 1400 pounds (7000 dollars), a huge sum for those days, may be ascribed to the first fervour of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, but is at least as naturally, ascribed to a lively hope. The money was returned to him after his breach with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. This again is more natural if it was made with a tacit condition, than if it was absolute and the outcome of pure charity. Lastly, the report that Marcion on his arrival at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> had to hand in or to renew a confession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (Tert., "De Praeser., " xxx; "Adv. Mar.", I, xx; "de carne Christi", ii) fits in naturally with the supposition of his being a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but would be, as G. Kr&uuml;ger points out, unheard of in the case of a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>We can take it for granted then, that Marcion was a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, probably an assistant or suffragan of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> at <a href="14014b.htm">Sinope</a>. Having fallen out with his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> he travels to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, being a seafarer or shipowner and a great traveler, he already may have been known and where his wealth obtains him influence and position. If <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> supposes him to have been admitted to the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and Epiphanius says that he was refused admittance, the two statements can easily be reconciled if we understand the former of mere membership or communion, the latter of the acceptance of his claims. His episcopal dignity has received mention at least in two early writers, who speak of him as having "from <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> become an <a href="01624b.htm">apostate</a>" (Optatus of <a href="10304b.htm">Mileve</a>, IV, v), and of his followers as being surnamed after a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> instead of being called <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> after <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> (Adamantius, "Dial.", I, ed. Sande Bakhuysen). Marcion is said to have asked the Roman <a href="12406a.htm">presbyters</a> the explanation of <a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs16">Matthew 9:16-17</a>, which he evidently wished to understand as expressing the incompatibility of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> with the Old, but which they interpreted in an <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> sense. His final breach with the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> occurred in the autumn of 144, for the Marcionites counted 115 years and 6 months from the time of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the beginning of their <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> roughly speaks of a hundred years and more. Marcion seems to have made common cause with Cerdo (q.v.), the Syrian <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, who was at the time in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; that his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was actually derived from that <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> seems unlikely. <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> relates (<a href="../fathers/0103303.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.3</a>) that <a href="12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, meeting Marcion in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was asked by him: Dost thou recognize us? and gave answer: I recognize thee as the first born of <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a>. This meeting must have happened in 154, by which time Marcion had displayed a great and successful activity, for <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin Martyr</a> in his first Apology (written about 150), describes Marcion's <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> as spread everywhere. These half a dozen years seem to many too short a time for such prodigious success and they believe that Marcion was active in <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> long before he came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02107.htm"><em>Stromata</em> VII.7.106</a>) calls him the older contemporary of <a href="02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Valentinus, but if so, he must have been a middle-aged man when he came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and as previous propaganda in the East is not impossible. That the Chronicle of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> places the beginning of Marcionism in 138, strongly favors this view. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> relates in 207 (the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of his Adv. Marc., IV, iv) that Marcion professed penitence and accepted as condition of his readmittance into the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> that he should bring back to the fold those whom he had led astray, but death prevented his carrying this out. The precise <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of his death is not known.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Doctrine and discipline</h2>

<p>We must distinguish between the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Marcion himself and that of his followers. Marcion was no <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> dreamer. He wanted a <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> untrammeled and undefiled by association with <a href="08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was the New Covenant pure and simple. Abstract questions on the origin of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> or on the essence of the <a href="06608a.htm">Godhead</a> interested him little, but the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was a <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the faithful and a stumbling-block to the refined and <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="06422a.htm">gentiles</a> by its crudity and cruelty, and the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> had to be set aside. The two great obstacles in his way he removed by drastic measures. He had to account for the existence of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and he accounted for it by postulating a secondary deity, a <a href="04707b.htm">demiurgus</a>, who was god, in a sense, but not the <a href="06608a.htm">supreme God</a>; he was just, rigidly just, he had his good qualities, but he was not the good god, who was Father of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. The metaphysical relation between these two gods troubled Marcion little; of divine emanation, <a href="01173c.htm">aeons</a>, syzygies, <a href="05551b.htm">eternally</a> opposed principles of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, he knows nothing. He may be almost a <a href="09591a.htm">Manichee</a> in practice, but in theory he has not reached absolute consistency as Mani did a hundred years later. Marcion had secondly to account for those passages in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> which countenanced the Old. He resolutely cut out all texts that were contrary to his <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>; in fact, he created his own <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> admitting but one gospel, a mutilation of St. Luke, and an Apostolicon containing ten epistles of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. The mantle of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> had fallen on the shoulders of Marcion in his struggle with the Judaisers. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of his day were nothing but the Judaisers of the previous century. The pure Pauline Gospel had become corrupted and Marcion, not obscurely, hinted that even the pillar Apostles, Peter, James, and John had betrayed their trust. He loves to speak of "false apostles", and lets his hearers infer who they were. Once the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> has been completely got rid of, Marcion has no further desire for change. He makes his purely <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> Church as like the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as possible, consistent with his deep seated <a href="12581a.htm">Puritanism</a>. The first description of Marcion's <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> dates from <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>: "With the help of the <a href="04764a.htm">devil</a> Marcion has in every country contributed to <a href="02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and the refusal to acknowledge the Creator of all the world as <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>". He recognizes another god, who, because he is essentially greater (than the World maker or <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>) has done greater deeds than he (<em>hos onta meizona ta meizona para touton pepikeni</em>) The supreme God is <em>hagathos</em>, just and righteous. The good God is all <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, the inferior god gives way to fierce <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a>. Though less than the good god, yet the just god, as world creator, has his independent sphere of activity. They are not opposed as <a href="01233a.htm">Ormusz and Ahriman</a>, though the good God interferes in favour of men, for he alone is all-wise and all-powerful and loves mercy more than punishment. All men are indeed created by the <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, but by special choice he elected the Jewish people as his own and thus became the god of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>His <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> outlook is limited to the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, his struggle with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> seems a battle with texts and nothing more. The <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> enough, Moses and the Prophets are messengers of the <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, the <a href="10212c.htm">Jewish Messias</a> is sure to come and found a millennial kingdom for the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> on earth, but the <a href="10212c.htm">Jewish messias</a> has nothing whatever to do with the <a href="10212c.htm">Christ of God</a>. The Invisible, Indescribable, Good God (<em>aoratos akatanomastos agathos theos</em>), formerly unknown to the creator as well as to his creatures, has revealed Himself in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. How far Marcion admitted a Trinity of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> in the <a href="06608a.htm">supreme Godhead</a> is not known; <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> is indeed the <a href="14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but he is also simply <a href="06608a.htm">"God"</a> without further qualification; in fact, Marcion's gospel began with the words; "In the fifteenth year of the <a href="14717b.htm">Emperor Tiberius</a> <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> descended in Capharnaum and taught on the <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>". However daring and capricious this manipulation of the Gospel text, it is at least a splendid testimony that, in <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> circles of the first half of the second century the Divinity of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> was a central <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>. To Marcion however <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> was <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> Manifest not <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> Incarnate. His <a href="14597a.htm">Christology</a> is that of the <a href="05070c.htm">Docetae</a> rejecting the inspired history of the Infancy, in fact, any childhood of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> at all; Marcion's Savior is a "Deus ex machina" of which <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> mockingly says: "Suddenly a Son, suddenly Sent, suddenly Christ!" Marcion admitted no prophecy of the Coming of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> whatever; the Jewish <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold a Jewish <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> only, and this <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> had not yet appeared. Marcion used the story of the three <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, who ate, walked, and conversed with Abraham and yet had no real human body, as an illustration of the life of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> (Adv. Marc., III, ix). <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> says (<em>ibid.</em>) that when <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles</a> and seceders from Marcion began to believe that <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> had a real body indeed, not by birth but rather collected from the elements, Marcion would prefer to accept even a putative birth rather than a real body. Whether this is <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> mockery or a real change in Marcion's sentiments we do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>. To Marcion matter and flesh are not indeed essentially <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, but are contemptible things, a mere production of the <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, and it was inconceivable that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> should really have made them His own. <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life on earth was a continual contrast to the conduct of the <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>. Some of the contrasts are cleverly staged: the <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> sent bears to devour children for puerile merriment (Kings)-- <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> bade children come to Him and He fondled and blessed them; the <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> in his law declared <a href="09182a.htm">lepers</a> unclean and banished them &#151; but <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> touched and healed them. <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> putative passion and death was the work of the <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, who, in revenge for <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> abolition of the Jewish law delivered Him up to <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a>. But even in <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a> Christ overcame the <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> by preaching to the spirits in Limbo, and by His <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> He founded the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> Kingdom of the Good God. Epiphanius (Haer., xlii, 4) says that Marcionites believed that in Limbo Christ brought <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> to Cain, Core, Dathan and Abiron, Esau, and the <a href="06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but left in damnation all <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. This may have been held by some Marcionites in the fourth century, but it was not the teaching of Marcion himself, who had no <a href="01564b.htm">Antinomian</a> tendencies. Marcion denied the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>, "for flesh and blood shall not inherit the Kingdom of God", and denied the second coming of Christ to judge the living and the dead, for the good God, being all <a href="06636b.htm">goodness</a>, does not punish those who reject Him; He simply leaves them to the <a href="04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, who will cast them into everlasting fire.</p>

<p>With regard to discipline, the main point of difference consists in his rejection of marriage, i.e. he <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> only those who were not living in matrimony: virgins, <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a>, <a href="03481a.htm">celibates</a>, and eunuchs (Tert., "Adv. Marc.", I, xxix); all others remained <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. On the other hand the absence of division between <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, in Marcionite worship, shocked <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but it was emphatically defended by Marcion's appeal to <a href="../bible/gal006.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>. According to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (Adv. Marc., I, xiv) he used water in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, anointed his faithful with oil and gave milk and honey to the <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and in so far retained the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> practices, although, says <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, all these things are "beggarly elements of the Creator." Marcionites must have been excessive fasters to provoke the ridicule of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in his <a href="10521a.htm">Montanist</a> days. Epiphanius says they <a href="05789c.htm">fasted</a> on Saturday out of a spirit of opposition to the <a href="06608a.htm">Jewish God</a>, who made the <a href="13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> a day of rejoicing. This however may have been merely a western custom adopted by them.</p>

<h2 id="section3">History</h2>

<p>It was the fate of Marcionism to drift away almost immediately from its founder's <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> towards mere <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. Marcion's creator or Jewish god was too inconsistent and illogical a conception, he was inferior to the good God yet he was independent; he was just and yet not good; his writings were <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> and yet to be discarded; he had created all men and done them no <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, yet they had not to worship and serve him. Marcion's followers sought to be more <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a>, they postulated three principles: good, just, and wicked, opposing the first two to the last; or one principle only, the just god being a mere creation of the good God. The first opinion was maintained by Syneros and Lucanus or Lucianus. Of the first we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> nothing beyond the mention of him in Rhodon; of the second we possess more information, and Epiphanius has devoted a whole chapter to his refutation. Both <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> and Epiphanius, however, seem to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> of Lucanus' <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> only by hearsay; it was therefore probably extinct toward the end of the third century. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De Resur., Carn., ii) says that he outdid even Marcion in denying the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, not only of the body, but also of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, only admitting the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection</a> of some <em>tertium quid</em> (<em>pneuma</em> as opposed to <em>psyche</em>?). <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> says that he had Lucanus' teaching in view when writing his "De Anima". It is possible that Lucanus taught transmigration of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; according to Epiphanius some Marcionites of his day maintained it. Though Lucanus' particular <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> may soon have died out, the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> comprised in the three principles was long maintained by Marcionites. In <a href="07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus'</a> time (c. 225) it was held by an Assyrian called Prepon, who wrote in defense of it a work called "Bardesanes the Armenian" (Hipp., "Adv. Haer.", VII, xxxi). Adamantius in his "Dialogue" (see below) introduces a probable fictitious Marcionite <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of three principles, and Epiphanius evidently puts it forward as the prominent Marcionite <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of his day (374). The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the One Principle only, of which the Jewish god is a creature, was maintained by the <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, who, though once a disciple of Marcion himself, became more of a <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> than of a Marcionist. He was accompanied by a girl called Philumena, a sort of clairvoyante who dabbled in magic, and who claimed frequent visions of Christ and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, appearing under the form of a boy. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> calls this Philumena a prostitute, and accuses <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles</a> of unchastity, but Rhodon, who had known <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles</a> personally, refers to him as "venerable in behavior and age". <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> often attacks him in writings ("De Praeser., " lxvii; "Adv. Marc.," III, g. 11, IV, 17) and even wrote a work against him: "Adversus Apelleiacos", which is unfortunately lost, though once known to <a href="07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a> and <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. Some fragments of <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles</a> have been collected by A. Harnack (first in "Texte u. Unters.", VI, 3, 1890, and then <em>ibid.</em>, XX, or new ser., V, 3, 1900), who wrote, "De Apelles Gnosi Monarchica" (Leipzig, 1874), though <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles</a> emphatically repudiated Marcion's two gods and acknowledged "One good God, one Beginning, and one Power beyond all description" (<em>akatanomastos</em>).</p>

<p>This "Holy and Good God above", according to him, took no notice of things below, but made another god who made the world. Nor is this creator-god the only emanation of the <a href="06608a.htm">Supreme God</a>; there is a fire-angel or fire-god ("Igneus Praeses mali" according to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "De Carne", viii) who tampered with the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of men; there is a Jewish god, a law-god, who presumably wrote the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles</a> held to be a lying production. Possibly, however, the fire-god and the law-god were but manifestations of the creator-god. <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles</a> wrote an extensive work called <em>Syllogismoi</em> to prove the untrustworthiness of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, of which <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> quotes a characteristic fragment (In Gen., II, ii). <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles'</a> Antidocetism has been referred to above. Of other followers of Marcion the names only are <a href="08673a.htm">known</a>. The Marcionites differed from the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic Christians</a> in that they thought it unlawful to deny their religion in times of <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, nobly vying with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in shedding their blood for the name of Christ. Marcionite <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are not infrequently referred to in <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius'</a> "Church History" (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm">IV.15</a>; <a href="../fathers/250104.htm">IV.46</a>; <a href="../fathers/250105.htm">V.16</a>; <a href="../fathers/250105.htm">V.21</a>; <a href="../fathers/250107.htm">VII.12</a>). Their number and influence seem always to have been less in the West than in the East, and in the West they soon died out. Epiphanius, however, testifies that in the East in A.D. 374 they had deceived "a vast number of men" and were found, "not only in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> but in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Palestine, <a href="01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and the <a href="14561a.htm">Thebaid</a> and even in <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>". And Theodoret, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cyrus in the Province of the Euphrates from 423 to 458, in his letter to Domno, the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, refers with just <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> to having converted one thousand Marcionites in his scattered diocese. Not far from Theodoret's diocese, near <a href="04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, an inscription was found of a Marcionite church, showing that in A.D. 318-319 Marcionites possessed freedom of worship (Le Boss and Waddington, "Inscr. Grec.", Paris, 1870). Constantine (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, "Vita", III, lxiv) forbade all public and private worship of Marcionism. Though the <a href="11583b.htm">Paulicians</a> are always designated by their adversaries as <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and though their adoption of <a href="09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> principles seems undeniable, yet, according to Petrus Siculus, who lived amongst <a href="11583b.htm">Paulicians</a> (868-869) in Tibrike and is therefore a trustworthy witness, their founder, Constantine the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, on receiving Marcion's Gospel and Apostolicon from a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, handed it to his followers, who at first at least kept it as their Bible and repudiated all writings of Mani. The refutation of Marcionism by the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Archpriest Eznic in the fifth century shows the Marcionites to have been still numerous in <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a> at that time (Eznik, "Refutation of the Sects", IV, Ger. tr., J. M. Schmid, Vienna, 1900). Ermoni maintains that Eznik's description of Marcion's <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> still represents the ancient form thereof, but this is not acknowledged by other scholars ("Marcion dans la litt&eacute;rat. Arm&eacute;nienne" in "Revue de l'Or. Chr&eacute;t.", I)</p>

<h2 id="section4">Mutilation of the New Testament</h2>

<p>Marcion's name appears prominently in the discussion of two important questions, that of the <a href="01629a.htm">Apostle's Creed</a>, and that of the <a href="03274a.htm">Canon of the New Testament</a>.</p>

<p>It is maintained by recent scholars that the <a href="01629a.htm">Apostle's Creed</a> was drawn up in the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in opposition to Marcionism (cf. F. Kattenbusch, "Das Apost. Symbol.", Leipzig, 1900; A.C. McGiffert, "The Apostle's Creed", New York, 1902). Passing over this point, Marcion's attitude toward the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> must be further explained. His cardinal <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was the opposition of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to the New, and this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> he had amply illustrated in his great (lost) work, <em>Antithesis</em>, or "Contrasts". In order, however, to make the contrast perfect he had to omit much of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writings and to manipulate the rest. He took one Gospel out of the four, and accepted only ten <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Marcion's Gospel was based on our canonical <a href="../bible/luk000.htm">St. Luke</a> with omission of the first two chapters. The text has been as far as possible restored by Th. Zahn, "Geschichte d. N.T. Kanons", II, 456-494, from all available sources especially Epiphanius, who made a collection of 78 passages. Marcion's changes mainly consist in omissions where he modifies the text. The modifications are slight, thus: "I give Thee thanks, Father, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth," is changed to "I give thanks, Father, Lord of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>". "O foolish and hard of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken", is changed into, "O foolish and hard of heart to <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in all that I have told you." Sometimes slight additions are made: "We found this one subverting our nation" (the accusation of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> before <a href="12083c.htm">Pilate</a>) receives the addition: "and destroying the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and the <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a>."</p>

<p>A similar process was followed with the Epistles of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. By the omission of a single preposition Marcion had coined a text in favor of his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> out of <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#vrs10">Ephesians 3:10</a>: "the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden <em>from</em> the <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> who created all things" (omitting <em>en</em> before <em>theo</em>). However cleverly the changes were made, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> continued to press Marcion even with the texts which he retained in his <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, hence the continual need of further modifications. The <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> which he received were, first of all, Galatians, which he considered the charter of Marcionism, then Corinthians I and II, Romans I and II, Thessalonians, Ephesians (which, however, he <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> under the name of Laodicians), Colossians, Philippians and Philemon. The Pastoral epistles, the <a href="03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a>, Hebrews, and the Apocalypse, as well as Acts, were excluded. Recently De Bruyne ("Revue Benedictine", 1907, 1-16) has made out a good case for the supposition that the short prefaces to the Pauline epistles, which were once attributed to <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and others, are taken out of as Marcionite Bible and augmented with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> headings for the missing epistles.</p>

<h2 id="section5">Anti-Marcionite writers</h2>

<p>(1) <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin the Martyr</a> (150) refers to the Marcionites in his first Apology; he also wrote a special treatise against them. This, however, mentioned by Iren&aelig;us as <em>Syntagma pros Markiona</em>, is lost. <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (Haer., IV, vi, 2) quotes short passages of <a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a> containing the sentence: "I would not have believed the Lord Himself if He had announced any other than the Creator"; also, V, 26, 2.</p>

<p>(2) <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (c. 176) intended to write a special work in refutation of Marcion, but never carried out his purpose (Haer., I, 27, 4; III, 12, 13); he refers to Marcion, however, again and again in his great work against Heresies especially III, 4, 2; III, 27, 2; IV, 38, 2 sq.; III, 11, 7, 25, 3.</p>

<p>(3) Rhodon (180-192) wrote a treatise against Marcion, dedicated to Callistion. It is no longer extant, but is referred to by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.13</a>) who gives some extracts.</p>

<p>(4) <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, the main source of our information, wrote his "Adversus Marcionem" (five books) in 207, and makes reference to Marcion in several of his works: "De Praescriptione", "De Carne Christi", <a href="../fathers/0316.htm">"De Resurrectione Carnis"</a>, and "De Anima". His work against <a href="01593a.htm">Apelles</a> is lost.</p>

<p>(5) Pseudo-Tertullian, (possibly Commodian. See H. Waitz, "Ps. Tert. Gedicht ad M.", Darmstadt, 1901) wrote a lengthy poem against Marcion in doggerel hexameters, which is now valuable. Pseudo-Tertullian's (possibly <a href="15414a.htm">Victorinus of Pettau</a>) short treatise against all <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> (c. A.D. 240) is also extant.</p>

<p>(6) Adamantius &#151; whether this is a real personage or only a nom de plume is uncertain. His dialogue "De Recta in Deum Fide", has often been ascribed to <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, but it is beyond <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he is not the author. The work was probably composed about A.D. 300. It was originally written in Greek and translated by Rufinus. It is a refutation of Marcionism and Valentinianism. The first half is directed against Marcionism, which is defended by Megethius (who maintains three principles) and Marcus (who defends two). (Berlin ed. of the Fathers by Sande Bakhuysen, Leipzig, 1901).</p>

<p>(7) <a href="07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus of Rome</a> (c. 220) speaks of Marcion in his "Refutation of All Heresies", book VII, ch. 17-26; and X, 15)</p>

<p>(8) <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> wrote his work against <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> in 374, and is the second main source of information in his Ch. xlii-xliv). He is invaluable for the reconstruction of Marcion's Bible text, as he gives 78 and 40 passages from Marcion's <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> where it differs from ours and adds a short refutation in each instance.</p>

<p>(9) <a href="05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a> (373) maintains in many of his writings a polemic against Marcion, as in his "Commentary on the Diatesseron" (J.R. Harris, "Fragments of Com. on Diates.", London, 1895) and in his "Metrical Sermons" (Roman ed., Vol II, 437-560, and Overbeek's Ephraem etc., Opera Selecta).</p>

<p>(10) Eznik, an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Archpriest, or possibly <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bagrawand (478) wrote a "Refutation of the Sects", of which Book IV is a refutation of Marcion. Translated into German, J.M. Schmid, <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1900.</p>
