<h2 id="section1">Friedrich Leopold, Count zu Stolberg</h2>

<p>Born at Brammstedt in Holstein (then a part of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>), 7 November, 1750; d. at Sonderm&uuml;hlen near <a href="11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, 5 December, 1819. He belonged to the younger branch of the Stolberg <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> and was the son of a <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> magistrate and owner of a manorial estate. A few years after his birth the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> moved to Copenhagen and soon formed friendships with distinguished literary men, especially Klopstock. Klopstock was then at the height of his fame and the fundamental principles which he held, devotion to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and country, made a deep impression on the young Stolberg. Stolberg's religious <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, it must be acknowledged, remained at first somewhat misty and confused, as his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> held to an eclectic form of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and read for their own edification the most heterogeneous authors, as <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a> and <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> and Saurin, Zinzendorf and Young. Together with his brother Christian, Friedrich Leopold went to the University of Halle in 1770, in order to study <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. His other studies embraced the classics and various historical courses. Two years later the two brothers went to G&ouml;ttingen, where they joined the little company called the "Hainbund", a <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> of young men who had high aspirations for the freedom of the country, and who cultivated German poetry. Some of the poetry by the members of the "Bund", has a permanent value. However, besides B&uuml;rger, H&ouml;lty, and Voss, of all the members of the "Bund" only Stolberg has, in reality, not been forgotten, and his name continues to live less on account of his literary productions than because of his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>After completing his studies at the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> Stolberg made a journey in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> with Goethe and Count von Haugwitz in 1775. Here, besides meeting other distinguished <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, he became acquainted with Lavater, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. In 1777 he entered the service of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Prince-Bishop of L&uuml;beck, and was for a while the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> envoy at the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> Court. Somewhat later, in 1781, he was chief administrator at Eutin and in 1785 magistrate at Neuenburg in the Duchy of Oldenburg. Four years after this he was the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> ambassador at <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. In 1791 he was appointed president of the board of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of the Prince-Bishop of L&uuml;beck, and in 1797 he was sent as ambassador to <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. On 1 June, 1800, he joined the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the private <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="06367a.htm">Princess Gallitzin</a> at <a href="11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, and on 22 August he resigned his various positions. After this he lived first at M&uuml;nster in <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, then from 1812 at Tatenhausen near Bielefeld, and finally from 1816 at Sonderm&uuml;hle near <a href="11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, where he died after a short illness. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in the cemetery at Stockkempen. Stolberg was twice married. His first wife, Agnes von Witzleben, died on 11 November, 1788, after six years of <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> married life, leaving two sons and two daughters. Two years later Stolberg married Countess Sophie von Redern. After their marriage he and his wife took a long journey through <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. This tour was of great importance for his religious development, as he then made the acquaintance of the devout <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Freiherr von Droste-Vischering, as well as of Droste-Vischering's resident tutor, the distinguished <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> Katerkamp. By his second marriage Stolberg had a large <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, and all, with the exception of the oldest daughter, followed the father's example and joined the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in 1801. The oldest daughter, Agnes, was <a href="02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Count Ferdinand of Stolberg-Wernigerode, but her son in 1854 <a href="04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Four sons and two sons-in-law took part in the campaign against <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in 1814; one of these sons was killed at Ligny (1815).</p>

<p>Stolberg's change of religion attracted great attention. Many of his numerous friends deserted and some abused him, such as Gleim, Jacobi, and others, or attacked him with bitter <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> as Voss in his pamphlet "Wie ward Fritz Stolberg ein Unfreier?" He was charged, and this charge is even now repeated, with having been a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> for years before he publicly left the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a>. Men who judged of the facts as they were, as Freiherr von Stein, Goethe, and especially Lavater, looked on his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> in a kindly spirit and imputed no ignoble motives to him. They were entirely justified in so doing, for even after his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> and notwithstanding his genuine <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> Stolberg was never able to rid himself altogether of the <a href="14383c.htm">syncretism</a> of the paternal home. Both in days of good and ill health he sought edification, after his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> as before, from <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> and sermons. Even when dying, besides the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, he had read aloud to him Klopstock's poems and passages from the writings of the "Wandsbecker Boten", the well-known <a href="09771a.htm">freemason</a>, Claudius. He was also a warm friend of the late Bishop Sailer. Sailer's <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> was <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a> in his own day, but without reason; whatever be thought of his peculiar <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, he was a strong believer in the primacy of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and a defender of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> against State encroachments.</p>

<p>As regards Stolberg's literary works, there is no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the quantity exceeded the quality. They may be divided thus: translations, as "Homer" (1778); "Plato" (1796); "&#198;schylus" (1802); poetry, as "Ballads" (1779), "Iambics" (1784), "Plays" (1787); "Travels" (1791); novels, as "The Island" (1788). After his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> he devoted himself chiefly to the preparation of a "Geschichte der Religion Jesu Christi" (1806&mdash;), which is marked by a warmth of tone, although not without <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> in investigation. He also wrote a history of <a href="01309d.htm">Alfred the Great</a> (1816); a life of <a href="15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>; translated passages from the works of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, and also wrote meditations on the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which, however, together with the "B&uuml;chlein der Liebe", and the polemical pamphlet "Kurze Abfertigung des langen Schm&#228;hschrifts des Hofrats Voss", did not appear until after his death. At first Stolberg's muse was entirely influenced by the <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Klopstock. However, the poet soon abandoned the antique poetic measures and successfully adopted German rhyme. Most of his poetry is now out of date and scarcely half-a-dozen of his "Lieder" are known to the present generation. In his own day his translations from the classics were considered well done. At times credulity and lack of critical discernment mar his descriptions of travel and historical writings. Probably his best work is contained in his devotional writings, but even these are not entirely satisfactory, especially the translation of the numerous passages from the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, which at times are not very correct.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Joseph Stolberg</h2>

<p>Son of the poet Friedrich Leopold, b. 12 August, 1804; d. 5 April, 1859. In 1849 he was president of the general assembly of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Associations held at <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (2-5 October). At this congress the St. Boniface Association was founded, and Stolberg was elected its first president. In the winter of 1849-50 he made a laborious journey to all the <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and until his death was constantly active in the interests of the association. Since 1904 his son Hermann (b. at Westheim in <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 28 February, 1854) has been president of the St. Boniface Association.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Katharina Stolberg</h2>

<p>Sister of Friedrich Leopold, b. at Bramstedt, 5 December, 1751; d. at Peterswaldau, 22 February, 1832. Gifted with a highly poetical nature, she was one of the most learned <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> of her age. As she was most devotedly attached to her brother and lived with him after the death of his wife, his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> aroused in her an intense struggle between her <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for him and her Evangelical <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>. In 1802 she also joined the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; however, new <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> struggles followed, and finally she returned to <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>.</p>
