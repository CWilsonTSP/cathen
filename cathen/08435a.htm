<h2 id="section1">First epistle</h2>

<h3 id="I">Authenticity</h3>

<h4 id="i">External evidence</h4>

<p>The very brevity of this letter (105 verses divided into five chapters) and the lateness of its composition might lead us to suspect no traces thereof in the <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>. Such traces there are, some unquestionable. <a href="12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> (A.D. 110-117, according to Harnack, whose <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a> we shall follow in this article) wrote to the Philippians: "For whosoever confesseth not that <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is come in the Flesh is <a href="01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>" (c. vi; Funk, "Patres Apostolici", I, 304). Here is an evident trace of I John, iv, 2-3; so evident that Harnack deems this witness of <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> conclusive <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that the first Epistle and, consequently, the Gospel of John were written toward the end of the reign of <a href="15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, i.e. not later than A.D. 117 (cf. Chronologie der Altchristlichen Litteratur, I, 658). It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> does not name John nor quote word for word; the <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> cite from memory and are not wont to name the inspired writer whom they cite. The argument from <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp's</a> use of I John is strengthened by the fact that he was, according to Iren&aelig;us, the disciple of St. John. The distinctively Johannine phrase "come in the Flesh" (<em>en sarki eleluthota</em>) is also used by the Epistle of Barnabas (v, 10; Funk, op. cit., I, 53), which was written about A.D. 130. We have it on the authority of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.20</a>) that this First Epistle of John was cited by Papias, a disciple of John and fellow of <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> (A.D. 145-160). Iren&aelig;us (A.D. 181-189) not only cites I John ii, 18, and v, 1 but attributes the citation to John the Lord's disciple ("Adv. H&aelig;r." 3, 16; Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.8</a>). The Muratorian Canon (A.D. 195-205) tells the story of the writing of John's Gospel consequent upon a revelation made to the Apostle Andrew, and adds: "What wonder, then, that John so often in his letters gives us details of his Gospel and says of himself, etc." &#151; here I John. i, 1, is quoted. <a href="04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a> (A.D. 190-203) quotes v, 3, with his usual indubitable accuracy, and expressly assigns the words to John ("P&aelig;dag.", III, xi; Kirch. Comm., ed. I, p. 281). <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (A.D. 194-221, according to Sunday) tells us that John, in his Epistle, brands as <a href="01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> those who deny that Christ is come in the flesh (De Pr&aelig;scrip. 33), and clearly attributes to "John the author of the Apocalypse" several passages of the First Epistle (cf. "Adv. Marc.", III, 8, and V, 16, in P.L., II, 359 and 543; "Adv. Gnost.", 12, in P.L., II, 169; "Adv. Prax.", 15, in P.L., II, 196).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h4 id="ii">Internal evidence</h4>

<p>So striking is the internal evidence in favour of common authorship of the Gospel and First Epistle of John, as to be almost universally admitted. It cannot be by accident that in both documents we find the ever-recurring and most distinctive words light, darkness, <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, life, and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>; the strictly Johannine phrases "to walk in the light", "to be of the truth", "to be of the devil", "to be of the world", "to overcome the world", etc. Only such erratic and sceptical critics as Holtzmann and Schmiedel deny the forcefulness of this argument from internal evidence; they conclude that the two documents come from the same <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, not from the same hand.</p>

<h3 id="II">Canonicity</h3>

<p>The foregoing citations, the fact that there never was any controversy or <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> among the Fathers in the matter of the canonicity of the First Epistle of John, the existence of this document in all the ancient translations of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and in the great uncial <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (<a href="04085a.htm">Sinaitic</a>, <a href="04080a.htm">Alexandrian</a>, etc.) &#151; these are arguments of overwhelming cumulative force to establish the acceptance of this letter by the primitive Church as canonical Scripture, and to prove that the inclusion of the First Epistle of John in the Canon of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> was only a <a href="14388a.htm">conciliar</a> acceptance of an existing fact &#151; the feet that the letter had always been among the Homologoumena of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a>.</p>

<h3 id="III">Integrity</h3>

<p>The only part of the letter concerning the authenticity and canonicity whereof there is serious question is the famous passage of the three witnesses: "And there are three who give testimony (in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one. And there are three that give testimony on earth): the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one" (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#vrs7">1 John 5:7-8</a>). Throughout the past three hundred years, effort has been made to expunge from our Clementine <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> edition of canonical Scripture the words that are bracketed. Let us examine the facts of the case.</p>



<h4 id="i">Greek manuscripts</h4>

<p>The disputed part is found in no uncial Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and in only four rather recent cursives &#151; one of the fifteenth and three of the sixteenth century. No Greek epistolary <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> contains the passage.</p>

<h4 id="ii">Versions</h4>

<p>No Syriac <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of any <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> &#151; Peshito, Philoxenian, or Harklean &#151; has the three witnesses; and their presence in the printed Syriac Gospels is due to translation from the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. So too, the <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> &#151; both Sahidic and Bohairic &#151; have no trace of the disputed part, nor have the <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which represent Greek influence through the medium of Coptic. The <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, which favour the reading of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, are admitted to represent a Latin influence which dates from the twelfth century; early <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are against the Latin reading. Of the Itala or Old Latin <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, only two have our present reading of the three witnesses: Codex Monacensis (q) of the sixth or seventh century; and the Speculum (m), an eighth or ninth century <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> which gives many quotations from the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Even the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>, in the majority of its earliest <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, is without the passage in question. Witnesses to the canonicity are: the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> of Theodulph (eighth century) in the National Library of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Codex Cavensis (ninth century), the best representative of the Spanish type of text: Toletanus (tenth century); and the majority of <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> after the twelfth century. There was some dispute as to the canonicity of the three witnesses as early as the sixth century: for the preface to the <a href="03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a> in Codex Fuldensis (A.D. 541-546) complains about the omission of this passage from some of the Latin versions.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h4 id="iii">The Fathers</h4>

<p>(1) <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, until the twelfth century, seem one and all to have had no <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the three witnesses as canonical Scripture. At times they cite verses 8 and 9 and omit the disputed portions of verses 7 and 8. The Fourth Lateran (A.D. 1215), in its <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> against Abbot Joachim (see <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 10th ed., n. 431) quotes the disputed passage with the remark "sicut in quibusdam codicibus invenitur". Thereafter, we find the <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> making use of the text as canonical. (2) The Syriac Fathers never use the text. (3) The <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Fathers do not use it before the twelfth century. (4) The <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> make much earlier use of the text as canonical Scripture. <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (third century) seems undoubtedly to have had it in mind, when he quotes <a href="../bible/joh010.htm">John 10:30</a>, and adds: "Et iterum de Patre et Filio et Spiritu Sancto scriptum est &#151; Et hi tres unum sunt" (De Unitate Ecclesi&aelig;, vi). Clear also is the witness of <a href="06315a.htm">St. Fulgentius</a> (sixth century, "Responsio contra Arianos" in P.L., LXV, 224), who refers to the above witness of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. In fact, outside of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, the Fathers of the African Church are to be grouped with <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> in favour of the canonicity of the passage. The silence of the great and voluminous <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and the variation in form of the text in the African Church are admitted facts that militate against the canonicity of the three witnesses. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (fourth century) does not seem to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the text. After the sixth century, the disputed passage is more and more in use among the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a>; and, by the twelfth century, is commonly cited as canonical Scripture.</p>

<h4 id="iv">Ecclesiastical documents</h4>

<p><a href="15030c.htm">Trent's</a> is the first certain ecumenical <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, whereby the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> established the Canon of Scripture. We cannot say that the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a> on the Canon necessarily included the three witnesses. For in the preliminary discussions signs that led up to the canonizing of "the entire books with all their parts, as these have been wont to be read in the Catholic <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and are contained in the old Latin Vulgate", there was no reference whatsoever to this special part; hence this special part is not <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="15030c.htm">Trent</a>, unless it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that the text of the three witnesses has "been wont to be read in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and is contained in the old <a href="15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a>". Both conditions must be verified before the canonicity of the text is certain. Neither condition has as yet been verified with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>; quite the contrary, textual criticism seems to indicate that the <em>Comma Johanninum</em> was not at all times and everywhere wont to be read in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and is not contained in the original old <a href="15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a>. However, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> must take into account more than textual criticism; to him the authentic decisions of all <a href="13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> are guiding signs in the use of the <a href="../bible.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and only the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has given to him as the Word of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. He cannot pass over the disciplinary decision of the Holy Office (13 January, 1897), whereby it is decreed that the authenticity of the <em>Comma Johanninum</em> may not with safety (<em>tuto</em>) be denied or called into <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>. This disciplinary decision was approved by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> two days later. Though his approval was not <em>in forma specifica,</em> as was <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X's</a> approval of the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili", all further discussion of the text in question must be carried on with due deference to this <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>. (See "Revue Biblique", 1898, p. 149; and Pesch, "Pr&aelig;lectiones Dogmatic&aelig;", II, 250.)</p>

<h3 id="IV">Author</h3>

<p>It was of chief moment to determine that this letter is authentic, i.e., belongs to the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> age, is Apostolic in its source, and is trustworthy. Among those who admit the authenticity and canonicity of the letter, some hold that its sacred writer was not <a href="08492a.htm">John the Apostle</a> but John the Presbyter. We have traced the tradition of the Apostolic origin of the letter back to the time of <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>. Harnack and his followers admit that Iren&aelig;us, the disciple of <a href="12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, assigns the authorship to <a href="08492a.htm">St. John the Apostle</a>; but have the hardihood to throw over all tradition, to accuse Iren&aelig;us of <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> in this matter, to cling to the <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> witness of Papias, and to be utterly regardless of the patent fact that throughout three centuries no other <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer knows anything at all of this John the Presbyter. The <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> witness of Papias is saved for us by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.39</a>, Funk, "Patres Apostolici", I, p. 350): "And if any one came my way who had been a follower of the elders, I enquired the sayings of the elders &#151; what had Andrew, or what had Peter said, or what Philip, or what Thomas or James, or what John (<em>he ti Ioannes</em>) or Matthew or any one else of the disciples of the Lord; and what were Aristion and John the elder, the disciples of the Lord, saying?" (<em>a te Apistion kai ho presbuteros Ioannes, oi tou kuriou mathetai legousin</em>). Harnack insists that <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> read his sources thoroughly; and, on the authority of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and of Papias, postulates the existence of a disciple of the Lord named John the Elder, who was distinct from <a href="08492a.htm">John the Apostle</a>; and to this fictitious John the Elder assigns all the Johannine writings. (See Geschichte der Altchristliche Litteratur, II, i, 657.) With all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authors, we consider that either <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> alone, or Papias and <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="05525a.htm">erred</a>, and that Iren&aelig;us and the rest of the Fathers were right, in fact we lay the blame at the door of <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. As Bardenhewer (Geschichte der Altkirchlichen Literatur, I, 540) says, <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> set up a straw man. There never was a John the Elder. So think Funk (Patres Apostolici, I, 354), Dr. Salmon (Dictionary of Christian Biography, III, 398), Hausleiter (Theol. Litteraturblatt, 1896), Stilting, Guerike, and others.</p>

<p><a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> is here a special pleader. He opposes the millennium. Wrongly fancying that the Apocalypse favours the Chiliasts, he assigns it to this John the Elder and tries to rob the work of its Apostolic authority, the clumsiness of expression of Papias gives occasion to <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> in <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the existence of two disciples of the Lord named John. To be sure, Papias mentions two Johns &#151; one among the Apostles, the other in a clause with Aristion. Both are called elders; and elders here (<em>presbuteroi</em>) are admitted by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> to be Apostles, since he admits that Papias got information from those who had met the Apostles (substituting <em>ton apostolon</em> for <em>ton presbuteron;</em> see <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.39.7</a>). Hence it is that Papias, in joining John with Aristion, speaks of John the Elder and not of Aristion the Elder; Aristion was not an elder or Apostle. The reason for joining the Aristion with John at all is that they were both witnesses of the present to Papias, whereas all the Apostles were witnesses of the past generation. Note that the second aorist (<em>eipen</em>) is used in regard to the group of witnesses of the past generation, since there is question of what <em>they had said,</em> whereas the present (<em>legousin</em>) is used in regard to the witnesses of the present generation, i.e. Aristion and John the Elder, since the question is what they <em>are now saying.</em> The Apostle John was alive in the time of Papias. He and he alone can be the elder of whom Papias speaks. How is it, then, that Papias mentions John twice? Hausleiter conjectures that the phrase <em>he ti Ioannes</em> is a gloss (Theol. Litteraturblatt, 1896). It is likelier that the repetition of the name of John is due to the clumsiness of expression of Papias. He does not mention all the Apostles, but only seven; though he undoubtedly means them all. His mention of John is quite natural in view of the relation in which he stood to that Apostle. After mention of the group that were gone, he names the two from whom he now receives indirect information of the Lord's teaching; these two are the disciple Aristion and <a href="08492a.htm">John the Apostle</a>.</p>

<h3 id="V">Time and place</h3>

<p>Iren&aelig;us tells us the letter was written by <a href="08492a.htm">St. John</a> during his stay in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103301.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.1</a>). Nothing certain can be determined in this matter. The arguments are probable in favour of Ephesus and also for the last few years of the first century.</p>

<h3 id="VI">Destination and purpose</h3>

<p>The form is that of an <a href="05413a.htm">encyclical</a> letter. Its destination is clearly the churches which St. John evangelized, he speaks to his "little children", "beloved", "brethren", and is affectionate and fatherly throughout the entire letter. The purpose is identical with the purpose of the <a href="../bible/joh000.htm">Fourth Gospel</a> &#151; that his children may <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and that <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> may have life eternal in His name (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#vrs13">1 John 5:13</a>; <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs31">John 20:31</a>).</p>

<h3 id="VII">Argument</h3>

<p>A <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> analysis of the letter would be a mistake. The thought is built up not analytically but synthetically. After a brief introduction, St. John works up the thought that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is Light (i, 5); so, too, should we walk in the light (i, 7), keep from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> (i, 6-ii, 6), observe the new commandment of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> (ii, 7), since he that loves is in the light and he that hates is in darkness (ii, 8-iii). Then follows the second leading Johannine thought that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is Love (iii-v, 12). Love means that we are sons of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (iii, 1-4); Divine sonship means that we are not in <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> (iii, 4-13), that we <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> one another (iii, 13-44), that we <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="14142b.htm">Son of God</a> (iv, 5, 6); for it was <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> that impelled <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to give us His only Son (iv, 7-v, 12). The conclusion (v, 13-end) tells the reader that the purpose of the letter is to inculcate <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, since this <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> is life eternal. In this conclusion as well as in other parts of the letter, the same salient and leading Johannine thoughts recur to defy analysis. John had two or three things to say; he said these two or three things over and over again in ever varying form.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Second epistle</h2>

<p>These thirteen verses are directed against the same <a href="05070c.htm">Docetic</a> <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> and germs of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> which St. John strives to uproot in his Gospel and First Epistle. Harnack and some others, who admit the canonicity of the Second and Third Epistles, assign them to the authorship of John the Elder; we have shown that this John the Elder never existed. The authenticity of this second letter is attested by very early Fathers. <a href="12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> ("Phil.", VII, i; Funk, "Patres Apostolici", I, 304) cites rather II John, 7, than I John, 4. St. Iren&aelig;us expressly quotes II John, 10, as the words of "John the Disciple of the Lord". The Muratorian Canon speaks of two Epistles of John. <a href="04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a> speaks of the larger Epistle of John; and, as a consequence, knows at least two. <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> hears witness to the two shorter letters, which "both together do not contain a hundred lines" and are not admitted by all to be authentic. The canonicity of these two letters was long disputed. <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> puts them among the Antilegomena. They are not found in the Peshito. The Canon of the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a> includes them after the fourth century; although only <a href="15030c.htm">Trent's</a> <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> set the question of their canonicity beyond the dispute of such men as Cajetan. The Canon of the <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, outside that of Antioch, includes them after the fourth century. The style and manner of the second letter are very like to those of the first. The destination of the letter has been much disputed. The opening words are variously interpreted &#151; "The ancient to the lady Elect, and her children" (<em>ho presbuteros eklekte kuria kai tois teknois autes</em>). We have seen that the elder means the Apostle. Who is the lady elect? Is she the <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> Kyria? The lady Eklekte? A lady named Eklekte Kyria? A lady elect, whose name is omitted? A Church? All these interpretations are defended. We consider, with <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, that the letter is addressed to a particular church, which St. John urges on to <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to the avoidance of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, to <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. This interpretation best fits in with the ending to the letter &#151; "The children of thy sister Elect salute thee."</p>

<h2 id="section3">Third epistle</h2>

<p>Fourteen verses addressed to Gaius, a private individual. This Gaius seems to have been not an ecclesiastic but a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> of means. He is praised by John for his hospitality to visiting brethren (verses 2-9). The Apostle then goes on: "I had written perhaps to the church; but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, doth not receive us" (verse 9). This Diotrephes may have been the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He is found fault with roundly, and Demetrius is set up for an example. This short letter, "twin sister", as <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> called it, to the second of John's letters, is entirely a personal affair. No <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is discussed. The lesson of hospitality, especially of care for the preachers of the Gospel is insisted on. The earliest certain recognition of this letter as Apostolic is by <a href="05011a.htm">St. Denis of Alexandria</a> (third century). <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> refers to the letters called "the second and third of John, whether these chance to belong to the evangelist or to someone else with a name like to his" (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.25</a>; Schwartz, II, 1, p. 250). The canonicity of the letter has already been treated. The greeting and ending of this letter are internal evidence of composition by the author of the previous Johannine letter. The simple and affectionate style, the firmness of the rebuke of Diotrephes are strictly Johannine. Nothing certain is known as to time and place of writing; but it is generally supposed that the two small letters were written by John towards the end of his long life and in Ephesus.</p>
