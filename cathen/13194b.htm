<p>Antonio Rosmini Serbati, <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and founder of the Institute of Charity, born 24 March, 1797, at Rovereto, Austrian Tyrol; died 1 July, 1855, at Stresa, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at home until his twentieth year, and, after a three years' course at the <a href="11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>, returned to Rovereto to prepare for <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="03689a.htm">Chioggia</a>, 21 April, 1821, and in 1822 received at Padua the Doctorate in Theology and Canon Law. In 1823 he went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with <a href="12586b.htm">Mgr. Pyrker</a>, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, met <a href="04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> and other prominent men, and was encouraged by <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to undertake the reform of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The next three years (1823-26) he spent in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> pursuits at Rovereto, devoting himself especially to the study of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. He had already adopted as principles of conduct:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>never to assume external <a href="03592a.htm">works of charity</a> on his own initiative, but, until summoned by some positive outward manifestation of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> will, to busy himself with his own sanctification, a thing always pleasing in the Divine sight (principle of passivity);</li><li>at any clear sign from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, to assume with alacrity any external work of charity, without, so far as concerned his higher will personal preferences or repugnances (principle of indifference).</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On these maxims he based the rules of the Institute of Charity which, at the instance of Maddalena, Marchioness of <a href="03298a.htm">Canossa</a>, and of John Loewenbruck, a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> from German Lorraine, he founded in 1828 at Monte Calvario near Domodossola. In 1828 he again went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was encouraged by <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> and later by <a href="12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> to pursue his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies and consolidate his institute. During this visit he published his "Maxims of Christian Perfection" and his "Nuovo saggio sull' origine delle idee" (1829; tr. "Origin of Ideas", London, 1883-84). In the autumn of 1830 he inaugurated the observance of the rule at Calvario, and from 1834 to 1835 had charge of a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> at Rovereto. About this time the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> made over to Rosmini several missions tendered him in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> by the <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, as also the Abbey of S. Michele della Chiusa in <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>. Later foundations followed at Stresa and Domodossola. The Constitutions of the institute were presented to <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> and, after some discussion regarding the form of the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of religious poverty, were formally approved 20 December, 1838. On 25 March, 1839, the <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> of the institute were taken by twenty Fathers in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and by six in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> (Spetisbury and Prior Park). The Letters Apostolic ("In sublimi", 20 Sept., 1839) formally recorded the approval of the institute and its rule, and appointed Rosmini <a href="12517a.htm">provost</a> general for life. The institute then spread rapidly in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and requests for foundations came from various countries. The publication of Rosmini's "Trattato della coscienza morale" (Milan, 1839) led to a sharp controversy. Against Rosmini were writers like <a href="10165c.htm">Melia</a>, <a href="11518b.htm">Passaglia</a>, Rozaven, <a href="16006b.htm">Antonio Ballerini</a>, all members of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, in which Rozaven held the office of assistant to the general. On the defensive, along with Rosmini, were L. Eastaldi, Pestalozza, Pagamini. For fifteen years the wordy <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> was protracted, with a truce from 1843 to 1846, due to an injunction of <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> enjoining perpetual silence on both sides. <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who succeeded <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory</a> in 1846, showed himself favourable to the institute, and various new foundations in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> attested its vitality. In 1848 Rosmini published (Milan) his "Costituzione secondo la giustizia sociale" and "Cinque piaghe della chiesa"; the latter against Josephism, especially in the matter of Austrian episcopal appointments in Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In August of the same year, he was sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by King Charles Albert of <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> to enlist the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> on the side of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> as against <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> appointed him one of the consultors to deliberate on the definability of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Immaculate Conception, and at the outbreak of the revolution asked Rosmini to share his exile at <a href="06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>. <a href="01583d.htm">Antonelli's</a> influence, however, prevailed and Rosmini left <a href="06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, 19 June, 1849. His works, "Costitunone" and "Cinque piaghe", were condemned in August, a sentence which he unhesitatingly accepted. A further attack was made on him in the "Postille" and the "Lettere di un prete Bolognese" (1848). <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (1850) referred the "Postille" to the Congregation of the Index, which rejected it as <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>. In view of other charges the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered an examination of all Rosmini's works. The decision, rendered 3 July, 1854, was that all the works be dismissed (<em>esse dimittenda</em>), that the investigation implied nothing disparaging to the author, to the institute founded by him, or to his exceptional services to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that to prevent any renewal and dissemination of charges and strife, silence was for the third time imposed on both parties. Within a year after this decision Rosmini died. His body reposes in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Santissimo Crocifisso built by him at Stresa. (See <a href="13198a.htm">ROSMINIANS</a>.)</p>

<h2>The Rosminian system</h2>

<p>According to Rosmini, philosophy is "the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of the ultimate reasons or grounds of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>". The <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> at the outset must answer the questions: What is <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? What is thought? Can we be certain of what we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>? Rosmini's answer is given in his ideology and <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a>. Intellect, he holds, is essentially different from sense; thought is objective, sensation is subjective. The term of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> act is seen in such a way that the seer, at the moment, is conscious neither of himself nor of any relation with himself as seeing. The primal and essential act of human intelligence, thus terminating in its object, is <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> &mdash; an attitude rather than an activity, in which the mind pronounces no judgment on what is known, but merely receives the communication of the intelligible object. All our concepts, when analyzed, reveal being (somethingness) as their essential constituent; or, conversely, human concepts are nothing but determinations more or less complex of the simple and elementary notion of being. This fundamental <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is indeterminate and general, conveying to the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> no <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of particular things, but simply manifesting itself as the essence of being. Our abstraction does not produce it, but merely discovers it already present in thought. Being, as it appears within man's experience, has two modes, each governed by its own conditions and <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> each with well-defined attributes, diverse, but not contradictory. Manifesting itself to the mind as the intelligible object, not exerting any stimulus upon the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but simply illuminating it, this is being in its ideal mode. As it acts or is acted upon in feeling, modifying the human subject in sensation, constituting the sentient principle in action and passion, this is being in its real mode. The former is essentially objective, simple, and one &mdash; universal, <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, immutable, eternal; the latter is subjective and, in our world, contingent, particular, temporal, manifold, and almost <a href="08004a.htm">infinitely</a> varied in aspect. Ideal being is not <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, but we may call it, says Rosmini, an appurtenance of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and even Divine, for its characteristics are not those of created finite things, and its ultimate source must be in <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. If thought had in it no element transcending the contingent and finite, all <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the absolute and <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> would be inexplicable, and <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, uncertain and variable, would exist only in name.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>To explain our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of particular real entities, Rosmini says that our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of realities reduces itself to a judgment whereby we predicate existence of what is felt by us. Real entities act upon man's senses, and he immediately recognizes them as particular activities of that essence of being already manifested under another mode in <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a>. Because of its simplicity, the human ego, or subject-principle, is constrained to bring together and collate its feeling and its <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of being, and thus it perceives being energizing in the production of feeling. This act of the human subject whereby it cognizes real entities, Rosmini calls reason. By sense we are introduced to realities, but we could not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> them as beings unless we already possessed the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of being. This is given to our mind prior to all perception or individual cognition; it is not acquired by any act of thought, but is implanted in us by the Creator from the beginning of our existence: it is innate, and constitutes for us the light of reason. Furthermore, it is the very form of the human intelligence, a form not multiple, but one &mdash; not subjective, but objective &mdash; i.e., not a quality or attitude or component of the human subject, but distinct from it and superior to it, existing in an absolute mode and called the form of the mind because, in manifesting itself to man, it draws forth and creates, so to speak, the act of his intelligence.</p>

<p>Logic, says Rosmini, is "the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of the art of reasoning". The scope of reasoning is <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>, i.e., a firm persuasion conformable to <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. The <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of a thing is, in last analysis, its being, and since being is the form of the human <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, it follows that a criterion of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> lies at the base of all thought and reasoning. The principles which govern reflection and argument are founded on the primitive <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> of being. "Being is the object of thought"; this is the principle of cognition, and it is antecedent to the principle of contradiction. Error is found, not in the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of being, which is without any determination, nor in the principles of reasoning, which simply express the essential object of the mind in the form of a proposition without adding anything foreign, but in reflection, and hence in the will, which usually initiates reflection. <a href="09324a.htm">Logic</a> shows us how to use reflection so as to attain <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and avoid <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>The Sciences of Perception are <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> and <a href="04413a.htm">cosmology</a>. The subject of <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> is the ego in its primal condition, i.e., stripped of its acquired relations and developments. The <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is felt by and through itself; it is essentially a principle of feeling. "The human <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is an intellective and sensitive subject or principle, having by nature the <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> of being and a feeling whose term is extended, besides certain activities consequent upon intelligence and sensitivity." This "extended term" is twofold: space, which, simple and immovable, underlies all sense phenomena as the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of being underlies the phenomena of thought; and body, a limited extended force which the sentient principle passively receives and thereby acquires individuation. It is a favourite <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Rosmini that the extended can exist only in synthesis with a simple, immaterial principle. Considered apart from this principle, the material corporeal term lacks the unity and coherence <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for existence and permanence. Our own body, the "subjective body", is felt directly as the proper term of the human sentient principle and is the seat of corporeal feelings. Other (external) bodies, since they modify not the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the bodily term in connexion with the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, are felt by an extra-subjective perception. We feel our own bodies as we feel external bodies, through vision, touch etc.; but we also feel them immediately with a fundamental feeling, always identical and substantial, in which no distinct limits, figure, or relation of parts can be assigned. Shape, hardness, colour etc., belong to the extra-subjective world. But the body is not merely felt by the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>; it is also intellectually perceived by the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> in a primordial and immanent judgment, whereby being is applied to it (the body) in the way above described. In this perception is found the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <em>nexus</em> intimately uniting <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. The body is the felt-understood term of the human principle which in this intellective synthesis performs its first act as a rational <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and exerts a real physical influence on its bodily term. Hence Rosmini's definition of life as "the incessant production of all those extra-subjective phenomena which precede, accompany, and follow parallel with the corporeal and material feeling (subjective)".</p>

<p>Every time that by generation an animated organism is produced, perfectly constituted according to the human type, the vivifying, sentient principle rises to the vision of the intelligible object, ideal being. This happens in virtue of a primordial law, established by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in the creative act. There is, however, no chronological passing from sentience to intelligence, as if one could assign an instant in which the human <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> was purely sentient and another following in which it had become rational. All is consummated in a single point of time. The <a href="14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a> is <a href="04674a.htm">deduced</a> from its nature as an intellective principle having for its object-term the eternal and <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of being. This is independent of space and time, and the act of <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> continues even after the bodily term has been dissolved by death, and the <a href="14153a.htm">soul's</a> immanent perception of its body has been for a period destroyed.</p>

<p>Cosmology, which considers the ordered <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>, the nature of contingent real being and its cause, is not a complete <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> in itself; it must be treated in connexion with the <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> of reasoning in which reflection, testing the observations of <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> and perception, discovers new <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> and arrives at the existence of beings beyond the reach of <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> and perception.</p>

<p>The Sciences of Reasoning are ontological and deontological. The former comprise ontology and natural <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. Ontology treats of being in all its extent as known to man, viz., ideal being, the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> object of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>; real being, i.e., subjective force and feeling; moral being, the relation between real and ideal &mdash; a special act of recognition and adherence on the part of the subject harmonizing it with the object. Light, life, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>; <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, sense, will &mdash; these are the forms under which the essence of being manifests itself in <a href="09580c.htm">man's</a> world; they are also the foundation of the categories. Natural <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> treats of the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute Being</a>, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a> is known, not through perception or direct <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a>, but through reasoning. Ideal being is being under only one of its forms and therefore incomplete; in the real world we meet only partial realizations of being. Comparing in reflection the products of our perception with the essence of being manifested in <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a>, we see that they do not exhaust the possibilities of that essence; yet this must find its full realization in some way far transcending our experience; it cannot, in that fulness, be finite and imperfect as are the things of this world. This <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute Being</a> Rosmini calls negative-ideal; it tells us not so much what <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is as what <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not.</p>

<p>Definite <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="06608b.htm">God's existence</a> are furnished by being in its essence and in each of its forms. The essence of being is eternal, <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a>; but these attributes it would not possess if it did not subsist identical under the other two forms of reality and morality, complete and perfect. Where it exists under all these forms, it is being in every way <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> and absolute, i.e., <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, the ideal form that creates intelligence is an eternal object and hence demands an eternal subject with <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> wisdom &mdash; <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. The real form of being is contingent, and it therefore postulates a First Cause in whose essence subsistence is included. Finally, the binding force of the moral law is eternal, <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>, absolute, and its ultimate sanction must be found in an Absolute Being in whom the essence of <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> subsists. Thus man naturally does not perceive <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; his <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is but of a negative kind. In the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> of grace, the real communication of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to man, a new light super-added to that of reason brings man into conjunction with <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> own reality, which reveals itself to him in an incipient and obscure manner, yet acts upon the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> with positive efficacy. Thus the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> becomes a new creature, <em>consors divin&oelig; natur&oelig;</em>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The deontological <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> treat of the perfections of beings and the ways in which these perfections may be acquired, produced, or lost. Amongst them, <em>ethics</em>, the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of virtue, is prominent (see "Compendio di Etica", Rome, 1907). Each moral act contains three elements: the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, the subject's <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>, and the relation (agreement or disagreement) between law and will. Man is not a law unto himself; the moral imperative must come from a higher source, from the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> and universal object of the understanding Being, manifested to the mind, has an order of its own, and the various entities we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> though it occupy different places in the scale of excellence. We cognize them by an act of <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>; we recognize them by a practical act of our will, adhering to the good we see in them with an intensity determined by the moral exigence of the object. The <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of an entity, therefore, as the medium which reveals its excellence, clothes itself with the authority of law; and as all <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> are but determinations of the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of being, the first of <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and the first principle of <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> is: "Follow the light of reason", or "Recognize being". Besides the testimony of consciousness and the consent of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a>, the <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> for <a href="06259a.htm">free-will</a>, i.e., the power of choice between objective good (<a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>) and subjective good (pleasure, self-interest), are closely bound up with Rosmini's theory of man and the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. Man is stimulated by sensation and his subjective modifications; at the same time he is illumined by the light of being eternal and absolute whence he can draw strength to overcome the allurements of sense and unite himself to the absolute good.</p>

<p>In reference to the third element Rosmini used a distinction which led to sharp controversy. By <em>peccatum</em> (<a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>) he means the <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a> condition of the will in its antagonism to objective good; by <em>culpa</em> (<a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> as fault), the same condition considered relatively to its cause, <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>. Ordinarily, <em>peccatum</em> is also <em>culpa</em>, and every <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is traceable to a free agent. But, in abnormal circumstances, there may be <em>peccatum</em> where there is not, at the moment, <em>culpa</em>. The acts of an acquired <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a> habit, when performed without advertence or deliberation, are contrary to law, though at the moment the will is not responsible. They are <em>culp&oelig;</em> and imputable, but to complete the imputability one must link them with the first free wicked acts whence the habit resulted. <a href="11312a.htm">Original sin</a> is a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> yet not a <em>culpa</em>, not imputable to the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> in whom it is found as to its free cause. The responsible cause is to be sought in the <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a> of Adam, whose <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> was both <em>peccatum</em> and <em>culpa</em>. Rosmini wrote voluminously in defence of the traditional <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>. Conscience he defines as "a speculative judgment on the morality of the practical judgment"; and since morality, he points out, belongs to an order of reflection anterior to the <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, there may exist in man moral or immoral conditions apart from <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> &mdash; a <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which he also applied to <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> and to certain states of virtue and vice. Regarding <a href="12441a.htm">probabilism</a>, he distinguishes, in the question of the <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> law, what is intrinsically <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> from what is <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> only on account of some extrinsic cause, for example, prohibition by positive law, and lays down the rule: "If there is a <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> respecting the existence of the positive law, and the <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> cannot be resolved, the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> is not binding; but if there is a <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> in a matter pertaining to the <a href="09076a.htm">natural law</a> and relating to an <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> inherent in action, the risk of the <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> must be avoided." This theory provoked controversy, but Rosmini maintained that it accorded substantially with the teaching of <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Ligouri</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of rational right arises from the protection which the moral law affords to the useful good. The classification of the goods and <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> which we possess in our relations with our fellow-men, is based on freedom and <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. Freedom is the power, which each one has, to use all his faculties and resources so long as he does not encroach on the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of others. <a href="12462a.htm">Property</a> is the union of goods with the human <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> by a triple bond, physical, <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and moral. The moral bond guards the other two, for the moral law forbids one man to wrest from another what he has united to himself by affection and intelligence. The subject of right may be either the individual man or man in <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. Concerning the three <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a> <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the full development of the <a href="09580c.htm">human race</a>, Rosmini speculates at length in his "Filosofia del diritto" (Milan, 1841-43).</p>

<p>Rosmini applied his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> principles to <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in "Della educazione cristiana" (Milan, 1856) and especially, "Del principio supremo della metodica" (Turin, 1857; tr. by Grey, "The Ruling Principle of Method Applied to Education", Boston, 1893). His basic <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> is that <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> must follow the natural order of development. The mind of the child must be led from the general to the particular. The natural and <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> order of all human thoughts is expressed in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>: "A thought is that which becomes the matter, or provides the matter of another thought." The whole sum of thoughts which can occur to the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a> is classified in divers orders of which Rosmini enumerates five. To the first order belong thoughts whose matter is not taken from antecedent thoughts; each of the successive orders is characterized by its matter being taken from the order immediately preceding it. The ruling principle of method is: Present to the mind of the child (and this applies to man in general), first, the objects which belong to the first order of cognitions, then those which belong to the second order, and so on, taking care never to lead the child to a cognition of the second order without having ascertained that his mind has grasped those of the first order relative to it, and the same with regard to the cognitions of the third, fourth, and other higher orders. In applying this principle to the different orders, Rosmini explains the cognitions proper to each, the corresponding activities, the instruction which they require, the moral and religious <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> which the child should receive. Both in his general theory of adapting <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> to the needs of the growing mind and in the importance he attached to <a href="08050b.htm">instinct</a>, feeling, and play, Rosmini anticipated much that is now regarded as fundamental in <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. "The child", he says, "at every age must <em>act</em>." To regulate the different kinds of activity, and to make each kind reasonable, is really to <a href="05295b.htm">educate</a>. It is in the kindergarten system of Fr&ouml;bel, the contemporary of Rosmini, that these principles are most fully worked out.</p>

<p>The most important of Rosmini's posthumous works, the "Teosofia" (ontology and natural <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>), was published in five volumes (Turin, 1859-64; Intra, 1864-74). In 1876 some <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers and periodicals in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, interpreting the "Dimittantur" <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1854, declared that Rosmini's works were open both to criticism and to censure. The Rosminian <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> on the contrary maintained that, while the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> gave no positive approval, it at least guaranteed that the books examined contained nothing worthy of censure and could therefore be safely read, and their conclusions accepted by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This view seemed to be confirmed by the <a href="10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a>, who, in a letter to the "Osservatore Romano" (16 June, 1876), reminded the editor of the silence enjoined on both parties and stated that no <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> censure could be inflicted. A month later, the "Osservatore Cattolico" of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, as ordered by the Prefect of the Congregation of the Index, acknowledged its interpretation to be <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a>.</p>

<p>After the death of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, the controversy was renewed. An answer of the Index was given (21 June, 1880) that "<em>dimittantur</em> signifies only this &mdash; a work dismissed is not prohibited" &mdash; and another (5 Dec., 1881) that a work dismissed is not to be held as free from every <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> against <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> and may be criticized both philosophically and theologically without incurring the note of temerity. Both answers were taken by the adversaries of Rosmini's doctrines to justify new censures, while the Rosminian writers contended that these answers in no degree rendered untenable the position they had always occupied. On 14 Dec., 1887, a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> condemned forty propositions taken from the works of Rosmini. The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>, published 7 March, 1888, lays special stress on the posthumous works which, it says, developed and explained doctrines contained in germ in the earlier books; but the propositions condemned have no <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <em>nota</em> attached. About one-half of the propositions refer to Rosmini's ontology and natural <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>; the remainder, to his teachings on the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, the Trinity, the Eucharist, the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> and the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchir.", 1891 sq.). Some of the propositions were clearly taught in the works examined in 1854; others repeated what Rosmini had said over and over again in the principal books published during his lifetime. The superior general of the Institute of Charity enjoined obedience and submission on the members. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in a letter to the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1 June, 1889) plainly stated that he approved and confirmed the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>. Cardinal Mazella discussed the propositions exhaustively in "Rosminianarum propositionum trutina theologica" (Rome, 1892). This brought out a reply from an erudite <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>, Prof. Giuseppe Morando, under the title "Esame critico delle 40 proposizioni Rosminiane" (Milan, 1905).</p>

<p>Besides the works already mentioned, Rosmini wrote a large number of treatises the more important of which are: "Il Rinnovamento della Filosofia in Italia" (Milan, 1836); "Psicologia", (Novara, 1843; Turin, 1887; tr., London, 1884-88); "Logica", (Turin, 1853; Intra, 1868); "La Filosofia della Morale" (Milan, 1831);" L'Antropologia in servizio della Scienza Morale" (Milan, 1838); "Antropologia sopranaturale" (Casale, 1884); "Teodicea" (Milan, 1845); "Filosofia della Politica" (Milan, 1858); "La societa e il suo fine" (Milan, 1839); "V. Gioberti e il Panteismo" (Milan, 1847); "Introduzione alla Filosofia" (Casale, 1850); "Introd. al Vangelo secondo S. Giovanni" (Turin, 1882).</p>
