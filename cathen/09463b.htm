<p>(LUCEORIENSIS, ZYTOMIRIENSIS, ET CAMENECENSIS).</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> located in Little <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Its present territory extends over the Governments (provinces) of Volhynia, Kieff, and Podolia. Originally it formed three separate <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but there were eventually united, through successful Russian pressure upon the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, intended to promote governmental authority over the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> is theoretically governed by the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who resides at Zhitomir, assisted by three <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishops</a>, for the cities of <a href="09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, Zhitomir, and Kieff; but at present two are vacant.</p>

<p>Originally this portion of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> was entirely of the <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, but with the conquest of Volhynia and Podolia by the Lithuanians in 1320, and the later conquest and union of <a href="09292a.htm">Lithuania</a> by the Poles in 1569, the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> became well established, and accordingly Latin <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> were founded. Lutzk, in the western part of Volhynia, is perhaps the oldest one; it is said to have been founded in 1358, but the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was then placed further west at Vladimir. In 1428 Bishop Andrew Plawka transferred the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> to Lutzk, then one of the principal cities of Volhynia. This occasioned some confusion in 1439 at the <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, when the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09463b.htm">Lutzk</a> (<em>Luck</em> in Polish) was directed to give up the name <em>Lucensis</em> and to write his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> <em>Luceoriensis</em>, to distinguish him from the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09417b.htm">Lugo</a>. Six <a href="12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> have been held in this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>: in 1607, 1621, 1641, 1684, 1720, and 1726; and in the eighteenth century it had 183 churches. The city of <a href="09463b.htm">Lutzk</a> itself goes back to the time of Vladimir the Great in 1000. It was made the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> of an Orthodox <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1288, and it was Cyril Terletzki, Exarch and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, who affixed the first signature to the act of union at the Synod of Brest on 24 June, 1590, and who went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to make his profession of union. In 1350 Lutzk was taken by the Lithuanians, and became a flourishing city. It was afterwards annexed to <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and in 1600 the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> took possession of the city and have ever since held it. At present it has 19,000 inhabitants, of whom 12,000 are <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Volhynia was annexed to <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1792, at the Second Partition of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and the <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> Diocese of Lutzk was suppressed. It remained however a Greek <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> diocese until 1839. Under Emperor Paul I in 1798 the Diocese of Lutzk was restored, and embraces the whole of the Province of Volhynia, although Zhitomir, the capital city, lies at the eastern border, near the Province of Kieff. The see has been kept vacant for long intervals during the past century. The statistics of the Diocese of Lutzk (1909) are: <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 279,157 (Orthodox, 2,106,960); <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 84; regulars, 6; <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 81.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Zhitomir is situated on the River Teterev, about ten miles from the frontier of the Government of Kieff. It is said to have been founded by Zhitomir, one of the followers of Rurik. In the thirteenth century it was taken by the Tatars and was afterwards subject to Lithuania and <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>. It was annexed to <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1778. The city now has a population of 65,000. The Diocese of Zhitomir is really that of Kieff. When Kieff and Zhitomir were annexed to <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suppressed, and the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kieff was expelled, but in 1798 when <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, in the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Maximis undique pressi", re-established the Diocese of Kieff, it was transferred by the request of the Russian authorities to Zhitomir, and then later united to Lutzk, in order that no <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> should dispute the See of Kieff with the Orthodox <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Theoretically, an <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> may reside at Kieff, but none has been allowed for many decades. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the united <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> resides at Zhitomir. The present (1909) statistics for the Diocese of Zhitomir, which includes a slight strip of Volhynia and the whole of the Government of Kieff, are: <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 220,893 (Orthodox, 2,988,694), with one regular and 105 <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, 70 <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, and one <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The Latin Bishopric of Kieff is first mentioned in 1321, just after the Lithuanians conquered this part of Little <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, when <a href="08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> made Heinrich von Provalle, A <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The next <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Jacob, also a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a>. Naturally the earlier <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Kieff were travelling missionary <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, establishing churches and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions of the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> throughout the land. Clement (d. 1473) is said to have been the first <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to fix his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> permanently within the city of Kieff, where he built a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In the previous century the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> had built a fine <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the lower portion of Kieff called Podol, which was for a long time the finest Roman church in that part of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Bishop Alexander Sokolowsky (1613-1645) had great success in establishing Latin churches, and in 1640 established a deanery at Tchernigoff. In 1626 Bishop John Osga commenced to build an additional <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in Zhitomir, which was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by his successor Gaetan Soltyk in 1751, and it is the present <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Two <a href="12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> were held in this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>: one in 1640 at Kieff, and the other in 1762 in Zhitomir.</p>

<p>The city of Kieff, "the mother of all the cities of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>", is really the cradle of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the Russian Empire. It is said to have been founded by Kii and his brothers Shchek and Khoriv, who were Poliani, the forefathers of the modern Poles; and was taken in conquest by the followers of Rurik in their search for a southern kingdom. Oleg, the successor of Rurik, came to Kieff in 882 and made it his capital. St. Olga was here <a href="04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, although she was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Constantinople. Later, her successor St. Vladimir, on his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, married Anna, the sister of the Greek emperors, Basil and Constantine, and on his return from Constantinople in 988 actively set about the conversion of the inhabitants of Kieff, who threw their <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> idols, Perun and the others, in the Dnieper and were <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> as <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, thus founding the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community within the present confines of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Kieff became under him and his successors the great capital of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>; it possessed the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> church, the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, and the first <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. It passed through great vicissitudes; for three hundred and seventy-six years it was an independent Russian city, for eighty years it was subject to the Tatars and Mongols, for two hundred and forty-nine years it belonged to the Lithuanian Principality, and for ninety-eight years it was a part of the Kingdom of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>. It was finally annexed to the present Russian Empire in 1667. Under the Lithuanian rule it rose to great prosperity, and obtained the Magdeburg <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of a free city in 1499, which it enjoyed until they were abolished in 1835. Naturally Kieff became the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> of the first <a href="02581b.htm">Christian bishop</a> in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Michael, who <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> Vladimir, was sent as the chief missionary to the Russians, and became the first <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff (988-992). His successors, Leontius, John I, and Theopempt, were also Greeks, but in 1051 Hilarion, the first Russian <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was advanced to the dignity of <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, with seven <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> under him. In 1240 the Tatars took the city of Kieff, pillaged it, and established <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a> rule in one of the great shrines of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. The taking of Kieff by the Tatars drove the Russians northwards and eastwards; in 1316 the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff changed his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> to <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, and thereafter the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> was ruled from that city. In 1414, after the change of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="10244c.htm">see</a> to <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>, the seven Russian <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the south chose a new <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff, who ruled over these southern <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Thus the Russian Church was divided into two great jurisdictions: <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and Kieff. Kieff, being of the <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>, was naturally dependent upon Constantinople, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of its origin, and gradually followed it into <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Yet for a long time after the break between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Constantinople it remained in unity with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The first four <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Kieff were <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and in union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Hilarion embraced <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> views strongly tinctured with nationalism, but his successor George was in correspondence with <a href="06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a>, while Ephraem (1090-1096) was the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff who established in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> the feast of the translation of the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="11063b.htm">St. Nicholas</a> (9 May) which was instituted by <a href="15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a>, but which was indignantly rejected by the Greeks of Constantinople and the East. During the following century the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Kieff followed the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> more closely, yet three or four of them remained in close relation with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Maximus (1283-1305) was a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, Cyprian (1389-1406) also had close relations with the Roman authorities, while <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> (1416-1419) was strongly inclined towards union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. From 1438 to 1442 the <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> was held for the <a href="15132a.htm">reunion of Christendom</a>. <a href="08188a.htm">Isidore</a>, <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kieff (1437-1448), with five other Russian <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, attended the council, signed the act of union, and became one of its greatest advocates. <a href="06787a.htm">Gregory II</a> (1458-1472), his successor, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the presence of <a href="12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a>, and was also an earnest supporter of the union. Misael (1474-1477) and Simeon (1477-1488) were also <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> (1498-1517) likewise adhered to the union, and was nicknamed "the Latin" by the <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a> Orthodox Greeks. Then followed several <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> who renounced the union and adhered to the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, until the time of Michael Ragosa (1588-1599), who took a definite stand for union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and who signed the act of union of 2 December, 1594, addressed to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It was consummated the following year, and the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Greek <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> thus constituted has ever since been in union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Then follows a line of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Kieff of the <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a>: Hypatius (1600-1613), Joseph IV (1614-1637), and Raphael (1637-1641). Then came the great champion of Russian Orthodoxy, the Metropolitan Peter Mogila, who fought the union and turned the Russians away from the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and who strove to undo the entire work of the united Churches. His task was finally accomplished within the confines of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> by his successors after the annexation of Kieff in 1667 to the Russian Empire by means of the successive forced "reunions" of the Greek <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to the Russian <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> (see <a href="13231c.htm">RUSSIA</a>). The city of Kieff (250,000 inhabitants) is beautifully situated upon the River Dnieper, and is divided naturally and historically into three parts: Petchersk, or the city of the grotto-caves; Podol, or the plain, which is now the commercial part; and Staro-Kieff, or old Kieff, upon the heights overlooking the river. The early <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who brought <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to Kieff were <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> dwelling in the caves on the hill-sides. Subsequently these were enlarged and others were made, like the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The great Petchersky <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> is situated above one of the series of caves, while the church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross stands above the entrance to the grottoes of St. Anthony, which are a series of <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a> dating back to 1100, when the <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> Anthony came from <a href="02047b.htm">Mount Athos</a> to Kieff. In these <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a> the remains of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> are enshrined, and there are numerous altars on which Mass according to the <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> is said every day. The grottoes of St. Theodosius are somewhat similar. On a hill fronting the Dnieper is a huge bronze <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of St. Vladimir, who brought <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to his subjects at Kieff. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Sophia, built in 1037 by Jaroslav, is a building remarkable for its <a href="10584a.htm">mosaics</a> and ancient frescoes in the Byzantine style, some of which date back to the eleventh century. As a counterfoil to this there is the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Vladimir, built at the end of the nineteenth century, containing a magnificent interior richly decorated in the modern Russo-Greek style by the best Russian artists. There are two <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> churches and one Greek <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in Kieff.</p>

<p>Kamenetz, usually called Kamenetz-Podolski to distinguish it from Kamenetz-Litevsk, is the capital of the Government of Podolia and lies in a beautiful situation upon the River Smotrich near the extreme western border of the Russian Empire, only a few miles from the Austrian frontier. It goes back to the thirteenth century. It grew to considerable importance under the Polish conquest. The <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> held it for twenty-seven years, but the Poles recaptured it in 1699. It was annexed to <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> at the Second Partition of <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1793. Kamenetz is mentioned together with Kieff as a Latin <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1373. The first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kamenetz was William, a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> (1375), and the second was Roskosius (1398). Alexander, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kamenetz (1411), and his successor Zbigniew (1413) promoted the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of union with the Greeks. <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> comprised the principal Latin <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the time, and in the following century the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were also introduced. When the Latin <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was re-established in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> by <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> in December, 1798, Kamenetz was made a separate diocese, comprising the whole of Podolia. In that same year it was also created an Orthodox see by the Russian Government, under the title of Podolia and Bratslav. In 1815 it was placed under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09463b.htm">Lutzk</a> and Zhitomir, and on 3 June, 1866, it was entirely abolished as a separate diocese, and annexed directly to Lutzk and Zhitomir. The city of Kamenetz itself has about 45,000 inhabitants, of whom one-fifth are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The statistics for the annexed diocese of Kamenetz (1909) are: <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 317,235 (Orthodox, 2,359,630); <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 111, regulars, 3; <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 96. In the whole of the three united <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders have been killed off by the simple process of not allowing any new candidates to enter, while the <a href="13675a.htm">secular priesthood</a> thrives with extreme difficulty because only natives and Russian subjects are permitted to enter the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> or to take charge of <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> are practically non-existent, owing to the restrictions of the Russian authorities.</p>
