<p>Roman emperor and German king, b. in 912; d. at Memleben, 7 May, 973; son of Henry I and his consort Mathilda. In 929 he married Edith, daughter of King Athelstan of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. He succeeded Henry as king in 936. His <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a> showed that the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> traditions of empire were still in force. Otto projected a strong central power, which was opposed by the German spirit of <a href="07761a.htm">individualism</a>. Otto's brother Henry headed those great insurrectionary movements which Otto was first <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to suppress. The new Duke of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, Eberhard, refused to pay homage to the king. Otto subdued <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and bestowed the ducal throne upon Arnulf's brother Berthold. This attitude towards the ducal, by the royal, power, now for the first time openly assumed, roused strong opposition. The <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>, ancient rivals of the Saxons, resented this absorption of power. The <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Duke Eberhard formed an alliance with Otto's half-brother, Thankmar, and with other disaffected nobles. Otto's younger brother Henry and the unruly Duke Eiselbert of Lorraine raised the banner of insurrection. Agitation was stirred up on the Rhine and in the royal Palatinate on the Saale. The affair first took a decisive turn when Dukes Eberhard and Giselbert fell in the battle of Andernach. The victory did not, however, result in absolute power. An internecine agitation in Franconia between the lesser nobles and the duchy favoured the king. Henry now became reconciled with his royal brother, but his insincerity was manifest when, shortly after, he conspired with the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and the seditious border nobles to assassinate Otto. The plot was discovered. In 941 there was a final reconciliation. The monarchic principle had triumphed over the particularism of the nobles, and the way was paved for a reorganization of the constitution. Otto made good use of his success. The hereditary duchies were filled by men closely connected with the royal house. Franconia was held by Otto in his own possession; Lorraine fell to Conrad the Red, his son-in-law; his brother Henry received <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, having meanwhile married Judith, daughter of the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> duke; while Swabia was bestowed upon his son Ludolph. The power of these dukes was substantially reduced. Otto was manifestly endeavouring to restore their ancient official character to the duchies. This belittling of their political position suited his design to make his kingdom more and more the sole exponent of the imperial <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>. It would have been a significant step in the right direction could he have made it an hereditary monarchy, and he worked energetically towards this object.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The apparently united realm now reverted to <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> policies in the regions where he had paved the way. The Southern races promoted the work of Germanizing and Christianizing in the adjacent <a href="14042a.htm">Slav</a> states, and by degrees German influence spread to the Oder and throughout <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The ancient <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of universal empire now possessed Otto's mind. He endeavoured to extend his suzerainty over <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and welcomed the quarrel between Hugo of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and Ludwig IV, each of whom had married one of his sisters. King and dukes in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> balanced the scales of power which Otto could grasp at any time as supreme arbitrator. With similar intent he turned the private quarrels of the reigning house of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to account. Conrad of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> now appeared as Otto's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. More significant was the attitude he was about to assume towards the complicated situation in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The spiritual and moral debasement in the Italian Peninsula was shocking, even in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The names of Theodora and Marozia recall an unutterably sad chapter of <a href="07365a.htm">church history</a>. The disorder in the capital of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> was only a symptom of the conditions throughout <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Upper <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> witnessed the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> of Friuli, <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor by Marozia's son, <a href="08425b.htm">John X</a>, against Rudolph II of Upper <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. After the assassination of <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> in 924, the strife was renewed between this Rudolph and Hugo of Lower <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Hugo finally became sole ruler in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and assumed the imperial throne. But his supremacy was soon overthrown by <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> of <a href="08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>, against whom, also, there appeared a growing opposition in favour of Adelaide, the daughter of Rudolph II of Upper <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, to suppress which <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> obtained forcible possession of the princess. All these disorders had been studied by Otto. Convinced of the significance of the ancient <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of empire, he wished to subject <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> to his authority, basing his right upon his royal rank. In 951 he came to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, released Adelaide and married her, whilst <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> <a href="11176a.htm">swore</a> allegiance to him. Under the influence of the Roman Alberich, the son of Marozia, <a href="01203a.htm">Pope Agapetus</a> refused the imperial crown to the German king. But even without the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>, the universality of his rule was apparent. He stood <em>de facto</em> at the head of the West. The royal power was now in need of the strongest support. New and dangerous insurrections demonstrated the lack of internal solidarity. Particularism once more raised its head. Otto's son Ludolph was the spirit of the new uprising. He demanded a share in the government and was especially irritated by the influence of Otto's <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> consort. The particularist element assembled in Ludolph's camp. It fermented throughout almost the entire duchy and broke out openly in many parts. The danger was more threatening than it had been in the first insurrection. On 954 the Magyars once more thronged into the empire. Owing to this crisis, the necessity for a strong, central power was generally recognized, and the insurrection died out. It was definitively terminated at the Imperial Diet of Auerstadt, where it was announced that Conrad and Ludolph had forfeited their duchies. Meanwhile the Magyar hordes surrounded Augsburg. Bishop Ulrich heroically defended the threatened city. In the great battle on the Lechfelde in 955, the <a href="07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> army was completely routed by Otto, who had advanced to the defence of the city. By this victory he freed <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> finally from the Hungarian peril. It marked a crisis in the history of the Magyar race, which now became independent and founded an empire with definite boundaries. It also caused Otto to realize that his great object of preventing the participation of power with the duchies was not attainable by force or through the prestige of his kingly rank. He at once endeavoured to obtain a strong support from the German Church throughout the empire.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The Ottonian system, a close alliance of the German realm with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, was begun. <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, too, had carried out the great conception of unity of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, but the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> had given a religious colouring to <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> statesmanship, whilst Otto planned a State Church, with the spiritual <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> a mere branch of the interior government of the realm. In order to solve this problem Otto was first constrained to permeate the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> with new spiritual and moral life and also free himself from the dominion of the lay aristocracy. His own deeply religious nature was his best guarantee. Some part of the spirit of ascetic <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> which distinguished his mother, Mathilda, was found also in the son; and his brother Bruno, later <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, as the clever representative of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> views, also exercised a great influence upon the king's religious dispositions. The close union of <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> had an equally salutary effect upon both of the powers concerned. By granting the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> such royal domains as were not in use, the State could devote its revenues to military purposes. For the united realms this situation was likewise rich in <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a>, since under the protection of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, commerce and trade were developed on the great <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> estates, and the lower classes received from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> protection against the nobles. The kingdom everywhere retained supremacy over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>: the king could nominate <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a>; the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were subject to the royal tribunals; and <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> could only be called with the royal approval. The German court became the centre of religious and spiritual life. In the so-called Ottonian renaissance, however, <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> were chiefly concerned, led by <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> of the royal family: Mathilda, Gerberga, Judith, <a href="01140a.htm">Adelaide</a>, and Theophano. Quedlinburg, founded by Otto in 936, was an influential centre of culture. But this Ottonian system depended upon one premise: if it were to benefit the State, the king must control the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. As a matter of fact, the supreme authority over the German Church was the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Yet Otto's policy of imperialism was rooted in the recognition of the above premise. The conquest of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> should result in the subjection of the highest <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority to German royalty. Otto was consequently <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make this campaign; and the much discussed question of the motive dictating the imperial policy is resolved. The unworthy <a href="08426b.htm">John XII</a> was at that time reigning in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was the son of Alberich, the Tyrant of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whose covetous glances were directed towards the Exarchate and the Pentapolis. A rival in these aspirations rose in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> who endeavoured to extend his rule over <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Otto complied with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> request for aid, which exactly suited his projected church policy. He had previously caused his son, Otto, a minor, to be elected and anointed king at the Diet of Worms in 961. He left his brother Bruno, and his natural son, Wilhelm, regents in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and journeyed over the Brenner and thus to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor on 2 Feb., 962. On this occasion the so-called Ottonian privilege was conferred, whose genuineness has been frequently, though <a href="08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, attacked. In its first part this privilege recalls the Pactum Illudovici of 817. It confirms the grants which the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> received from the Carlovingians and their successors. The second part goes back to the Constitution of Lothair (824), according to which the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of kings should not be permitted before swearing allegiance to the German ruler. When Otto marched against <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, Pope John entered into treasonable relations with the emperor's enemies; whereupon Otto returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and forced the Romans to take an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> never to elect a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> without his own or his son's approval. John was deposed and a <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>, <a href="09160b.htm">Leo VIII</a>, placed upon the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. Then <a href="02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> was defeated in his turn and carried a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to Bamberg. Once more <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, always in a state of unrest, rose in arms.</p><p>The exiled <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, John, forced his supplanter to flee. But John died in 964, and the Romans elected a new <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="02428b.htm">Benedict V</a>. The emperor energetically restored order and Leo was reinstated in his position. It was already apparent that the emperor really controlled the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> which occupied the position of a mere link in the German constitution. The Ottonian system was of the greatest significance to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> in her position towards the <a href="02137c.htm">secular powers</a>. How greatly the German King was strengthened through the close alliance between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> and how it enhanced the prestige of the empire, is evident from the progress that Teutonism and <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> were making in <a href="14042a.htm">Slav</a> territory. Otto chose Magdeburg, for which he had a special attachment, as the local centre of this new civilization, and raised it to an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>.</p>

<p>Recurring disorders now recalled him to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> whom he had chosen, <a href="08427a.htm">John XIII</a>, found antagonists in the Roman nobility. The emperor performed his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> as protector of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> with stern <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and punished the turbulent nobles. <a href="08427a.htm">John XIII</a> then <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> his son, Otto, emperor. As a <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> consequence of his imperial policy, he now openly avowed his intention of acquiring Lower <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His supremacy would be absolutely safeguarded if he succeeded in gaining possession of the southern part of the peninsula. Otto, however, finally abandoned the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> in the south. His son's prospect of obtaining a Byzantine princess for his bride turned the scale against it. The old German axiom of legitimacy, which was once more <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> in this marriage, was destined later on to revenge itself bitterly.</p>

<p>Otto was buried at <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. His contemporaries compared his tremendous physical strength to that of a lion. He was a Saxon through and through. In his youth he had learned all the arts of the profession of arms. Though subject to violent fits of temper, and conscious of his power and genius, he <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> devoutly as a child. A shrewd calculator, always convincing and always toiling, he correctly estimated the importance of diplomatic negotiations. He was a keen observer and possessed a fine <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> which always enabled him to select the proper <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> for important offices in the government.</p>
