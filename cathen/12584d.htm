<p><a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 14 Dec., 1824; d. at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 24 Oct., 1898. Through his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> Puvis was <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> &mdash; "Burgundian salt", says the proverb, that is the strongest French race, which produced such men as <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, Buffon, and <a href="08754a.htm">Lamartine</a>. His Lyonnaise <a href="07634a.htm">idealism</a>, which he inherited through his mother, never allowed him to lose the sense of the real, his dreams were always possible and probable. His vocation was slow in manifesting itself. His <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> intended him for the Ecole Polytechnique, and he was twenty-three years old when after his return from a first journey to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> he showed the inclination to <a href="11395a.htm">paint</a>. Determining to adopt art as a profession, he studied for a year without much profit in the studio of Henry Scheffer, the brother of Ary, and afterwards entered those of <a href="04689b.htm">Delacroix</a> and Couture. Another sojourn in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where he remained a year, fixed his <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> and determined his creed. He returned convinced of the artistic dignity and great eminence of decorative <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a>. The art of the great Italian masters, their manner of expressing in large compositions stamped with simplicity, the marvellous thoughts and the <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a> common to a period or a people, was thenceforth the object which he set about realizing for his contemporaries. Without being positively <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> his inspiration preserves a clearly spiritual character. In the midst of the materialistic invasion of the second half of the nineteenth century Puvis (with Eug&egrave;ne Carri&egrave;re) was the noblest champion of <a href="03710a.htm">religious art</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. As a <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> his originality freed him from early influences and tendencies. In a sense he was really self-taught. While admiring <a href="04689b.htm">Delacroix</a>, he detested the Romantic <a href="01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, with its disordered passions, and despised academic conventions, the timid taste and feeble <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the so-styled classicals. If he was in sympathy with any section of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, it was doubtless with the small group of landscape <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a>. In view of the importance with which he endowed landscape, the atmosphere which he instills into his frescoes, his liking for familiar horizons and lowly countrysides, together with his way of depicting and ennobling them, it seems evident that Puvis studied Corot. Finally in the <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> of Th&eacute;odore Chass&eacute;riau the young artist found an ideal similar to his own, a kindred spirit and a model for his Amiens pictures.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Puvis's first "Salon" was a "Piet&agrave;" exhibited in 1852, but he was constantly rejected for some years afterwards. His already remarkable pictures, such as his "Salome" or his "Julia", shocked the public by a determined absence of shadows (as in <a href="10584a.htm">mosaics</a>) and by an hieratic and Byzantine strangeness. At the Salon of 1859 he showed a "Return from the Hunt" (Museum of <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>), which is a striking work of youthful, heroic, barbarous movement. A great decorative talent became more and more evident in these stray works. Then came the opportunity to <a href="11395a.htm">paint</a> a hall for a private citizen: "At last", said the artist, "I have water to swim in." Henceforth he forced himself to that regimen of work which he observed all his life, the regimen of a <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> or cenobite in art; one meal a day at about seven in the evening, two rapid walks lasting an hour before and after work between his dwelling at Montmartre and his studio at Neuilly, sessions of nine or ten hours of incessant work, in the evening, reading, drawing, music, and conversation with his friends. Several journeys interrupted this regular life.</p>

<p>It is not known to whom the merit belongs of having singled out the young <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> and appointed him to the work which was his <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> vocation, nor who commissioned him to <a href="11395a.htm">paint</a> the frescoes of the staircase in the museum of <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, but it was through this chance that Puvis undertook the work which became his <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> sphere, that of monumental <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a>. In 1861 appeared "War" and "Peace"; in 1863 "Work" and "Rest", in 1865 these were completed by a new work "Ave Picardia Nutrix". There is nothing simpler or nobler than these <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a>. They are considered by more than one authority his best work, and in any case are the manifestation of a singularly new art. He showed an admirable faculty for generalization, a power of expressing life in universal features without cold allegories or romantic disturbances, while retaining a rustic realism and accent. But because of its very novelty, its mural simplicity, this new and vigorous work created astonishment and <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a>, with which the artist had to contend for many years. Still sharper criticisms were aroused by his "Autumn", "Sleep", "Harvest" (1870), and especially by the "Poor Sinner" (Salon of 1875), in which the touching archaism had the effect of a challenge. Puvis was accused of not knowing how to <a href="11395a.htm">paint</a> or draw. His <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> and projects seemed incomprehensible and like a defiance of public taste. There was no attempt to understand the methods of synthesis and simplification due to the particular circumstances of fresco, these pieces being persistently regarded from the same standpoint as the other Salon pictures. The result was a prolonged misunderstanding lasting fifteen years, during which much ink was wasted. Finally the intelligent initiative of the Marquis de Cheunevid&egrave;res, the best director of the <a href="05248a.htm">fine arts</a> <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> has ever had, afforded the <a href="08010c.htm">unjustly</a> criticised <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> the opportunity for a decisive triumph. This was in connexion with the <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the "Childhood of St. Genevieve" (1876-8), in the ancient church of that name, now the Pantheon. All that had been misunderstood at the Salon became clear here, all that, seen at close range amid factitious surroundings, had seemed a defect vanished and acquired a meaning in the perfect accord of the work with the monument. For the first time it was perceived that decoration had its own <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and that in this light each of the artist's apparent weaknesses became a charm and a necessity. Thenceforth the master held a unique position in the French <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. Without the title he was a sort of <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> laureate. During his last twenty years each of his successive works increased his henceforth undisputed reputation; they were "Ludus pro patria" (1880-2), for the Museum of <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a>; "Doux pays" (1882), for M. Leon Bonnat; for the Lyons Museum, the "Sacred Wood Dear to the Arts and Muses" (1884) with the "Antique Vision", "Christian Inspiration", the "Sa&ocirc;ne" and the "Rh&ocirc;ne" (1886); "Inter artes et naturam" (Rouen Museum); "Summer", "Winter", "Victor Hugo Presenting his Lyre to Paris", for the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> H&ocirc;tel de Ville (1893-5), and his last pictures, two new scenes from the legend of <a href="06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a>: "St. Genevieve Revictualling the Parisians" (1897) and "St. Genevieve Watching over Paris" (1898). After an interval of twenty years this last picture met with the same popularity as that which had welcomed the first scene of the "Childhood". It is a sublime picture, showing a single figure, in a monastic costume, standing erect and motionless in the night, watching over the blue roofs of the sleeping city.</p>

<p>During this last portion of his life the master exercised a wholly new <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over art; without being the leader of a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, or even strictly speaking having disciples, his word was law. To him the Government had recourse on solemn occasions, for instance the decoration of the vast and grandiose hemicycle of the new Sorbonne (1887-9). Large cities, such as <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, followed the example of <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and when <a href="02703a.htm">Boston (U.S.A.)</a> wished to decorate the monumental staircase of its <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> it was Puvis de Chavannes who was chosen to execute that great work (1896). All these works breathe the same <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of noble <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the same confidence in the higher destinies and ideals of the <a href="09580c.htm">human race</a>; it may even be said that what the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="11395a.htm">painters</a> of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> wrought in the Spanish Chapel and what <a href="12640c.htm">Raphael</a> did for the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> in the Camera della Segnatura, Puvis did in our era. He wrought his "Parnassus" and his "School of <a href="02046a.htm">Athens</a>", different it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> from those of old, but equally beautiful and sacred. He never lacked clear, ingenious and definite symbols for the plastic expression of general <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. He upheld the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the ideal in the modern world, making it known and detaching it from dreams, art, and poetry. He always had an unshakable <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the spiritual side of humanity and in the supreme importance of continuous search, aspiration, and unrest which form the moral capital of our race. As an artist he did much to maintain religion among men. After the death of <a href="10149a.htm">Meissonier</a> (1894), Puvis was elected by acclamation to the presidency of the National Society of French Artists. He was commander of the Legion of Honour. The moral dignity and the rectitude of his character and his life increased the respect paid to the artist and thinker. He married the Princess Marie Cantacuzene whom he had met in Chass&eacute;riau's studio. He survived her by only a few months. His last work, the lovely "Watch of St. Genevieve", reproduces her features and consecrates the memory of that charming companion. It is perhaps this sorrow mingled with an <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a> hope which imparts to this supreme work a haunting poetry and unforgettable beauty. (See <a href="11480c.htm">PARIS</a>, coloured plate.)</p>
