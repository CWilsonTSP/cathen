<p>Neo-Scholasticism is the development of the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> during the latter half of the nineteenth century. It is not merely the resuscitation of a philosophy long since defunct, but rather a restatement in our own day of the <em>philosophia perennis</em> which, elaborated by the Greeks and brought to perfection by the great <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> teachers, has never ceased to exist even in modern times. It has some times been called neo-Thomism partly because <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> in the thirteenth century gave to <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> among the Latins its final form, partly because the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> has gained ground that only <a href="14698b.htm">Thomism</a> can infuse vitality into twentieth century scholasticism. But <a href="14698b.htm">Thomism</a> is too narrow a term; the system itself is too large and comprehensive to be expressed by the name of any single exponent. This article will deal with the elements which neo-Scholasticism takes over from the past; the modifications which adapt it to the present; the welcome accorded it by contemporary thought and the outlook for its future; its leading representatives and centres.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section1">Traditional elements</h2>

<p>Neo-Scholasticism seeks to restore the fundamental organic doctrines embodied in the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> of the thirteenth century. It claims that philosophy does not vary with each passing phase of history; that the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of seven hundred years ago is still <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> today, and that if the great <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> thinkers &#151; <a href="14663b.htm">Aquinas</a>, Bonaventure, and <a href="05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>&mdash;succeeded in constructing a sound <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system on the data supplied by the Greeks, especially by <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, it must be possible, in our own day, to gather from the speculation of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> which it contains. These essential conceptions may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, pure actuality and absolute perfection, is substantially distinct from every finite thing: he alone can create and preserve all beings other than Himself. His <a href="08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> includes all that has been, is, or shall be, and likewise all that is possible.</p>

<p>(2) As to our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the material world: whatever exists is itself, an incommunicable, individual substance. To the core of self-sustaining reality, in the oak-tree for instance, other realities (accidents) are added &#151; size, form, roughness, and so on. All oak-trees are alike, indeed are identical in respect of certain constituent elements. Considering this likeness and even identity, our human intelligence groups them into one species and again, in view of their common characteristics, it ranges various species under one genus. Such is the <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> solution of the problem of <a href="15182a.htm">universals</a>. Each substance is in its nature fixed and determined; and nothing is farther from the spirit of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> than a theory of evolution which would regard even the essences of things as products of change.</p>

<p>But this statism requires as its complement a moderate dynamism, and this is supplied by the central concepts of <a href="01124a.htm">act and potency</a>. Whatsoever changes is, just for that reason, limited. The oak-tree passes through a process of growth, of becoming: whatever is actually in it now was potentially in it from the beginning. Its vital functions go on unceasingly (accidental change); but the tree itself will die, and out of its decayed trunk other substances will come forth (substantial change). The theory of <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and form is simply an interpretation of the substantial changes which bodies undergo. The union of <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and form constitutes the essence of concrete being, and this essence is endowed with <em>existence</em>. Throughout all change and becoming there runs a rhythm of finality; the activities of the countless substances of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a> converge towards an end which is known to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; finality, in a word, involves optimism.</p>

<p>(3) Man, a compound of body (matter) and of <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> (form), puts forth activities of a higher order &#151; <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and volition. Through his senses he perceives concrete objects, e.g. <em>this</em> oak; through his <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> he knows the abstract and universal (<em>the</em> oak). All our <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity rests on sensory function; but through the active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> (<em>intellectus agens</em>) an abstract representation of the sensible object is provided for the <em>intellectus possibilis</em>. Hence the characteristic of the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, its non-materiality, and on this is based the principal argument for the spirituality and <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. Here, too, is the foundation of <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a> and of the theory of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the justification of our judgments and syllogisms.</p>

<p>Upon <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> follows the appetitive process, sensory or <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> according to the sort of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The will (<em>appetitus intellectualis</em>) in certain conditions is free, and thanks to this liberty man is the master of his destiny. Like all other beings, we have an end to attain and we are morally <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a>, though not compelled, to attain it.</p>

<p>Natural <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> would result from the full development of our powers of knowing and loving. We should find and possess <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in this world since the corporeal world is the proper object of our intelligence. But above nature is the order of grace and our <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> will consist in the direct <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. Here philosophy ends and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> begins.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section2">Adaptation to modern needs</h2>

<p>The neo-Scholastic programme includes, in the next place, the adaptation of <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> principles and doctrines to our present <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> needs. Complete immobility is no less incompatible with progress than out-and-out relativism. <em>Vita in motu</em>. To make <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> rigid and stationary would be fatal to it. The doctrines revived by the new movement are like an inherited fortune; to refuse it would be folly, but to manage it without regard to actual conditions would be worse. With Dr. Ehrhard one may say: "Aquinas should be our beacon, not our boundary" ("Der Katholicismus und das zwanzigste Jahrh. im Lichte der Kirchlichen Entwicklung der Neuzeit", Stuttgart, 1902, 252). We have now to pass in review the various factors in the situation and to see in what respect the new <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> differs from the old and how far it adapts itself to our age.</p>

<h3 id="A">Elimination of false or useless notions</h3>

<p>Neo-Scholasticism rejects the theories of physics, celestial and terrestrial, which the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> grafted on the principles, otherwise sound enough, of <a href="04413a.htm">cosmology</a> and <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>; e.g. the perfection and superiority of astral substance, the "incorruptibility" of the heavenly bodies, their external connexion with "motor spirits", the influence of the stars on the generation of earthly beings, the four "simple" bodies, etc. It further rejects those <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> theories which are disproved by the results of investigation; e.g. the diffusion of sensible "species" throughout a medium and their introduction into the organs of sense. Even the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> that have been retained are not all of equal importance; criticism and personal conviction may retrench or modify them considerably, without injury to fundamental principles.</p>

<h3 id="B">Study of the history of philosophy</h3>

<p>The <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> scholars cultivated the history of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> solely with a view to its utility, i.e. as a means of gathering the deposit of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in the writings of the ancients and, especially, for the purpose of refuting <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> and thus emphasizing the value of their own <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Modern students, on the contrary, regard every human fact and achievement as in itself significant, and accordingly they treat the history of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in a spirit that is more disinterested. With this new attitude, neo-Scholasticism is in full sympathy; it does its share in the work of historical reconstruction by employing critical methods; it does not attempt to condense the opinions of others into a syllogism and refute them with a phrase, nor does it commend the practice of putting whole systems into a paragraph or two in order to annihilate them with epithet or invective. Neo-Scholasticism, however, does not confine its interest to ancient and <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> philosophy; its chief concern is with present-day systems. It takes issue with them and offsets their theories of the world by a synthesis of its own. It is only by keeping in touch with actual living thought that it can claim a place in the twentieth century and command the attention of its opponents. And it has everything to gain from a discussion in which it encounters Positivism, <a href="08603a.htm">Kantism</a>, and other forms or tendencies of modern speculation.</p>

<h3 id="C">Cultivation of the sciences</h3>

<p>The need of a philosophy based on <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> is recognized today by every <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. Neo-Scholasticism simply follows the example of the <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> and <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> philosophy in taking the data of research as the groundwork of its speculation. That there are profound differences between the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and modern times from the scientific point of view, is obvious. One has only to consider the multiplication of the <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> in special lines, the autonomy which <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> as a whole has acquired, and the clear demarcation established between popular views of nature and their scientific interpretation. But it is equally plain that neo-Scholasticism must follow up each avenue of investigation, since it undertakes, as <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and Aquinas did, to provide a synthetic explanation of phenomena by referring them to their ultimate causes and determining their place in the universal order of things; and this undertaking, if the synthesis is to be deep and comprehensive, presupposes a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the details furnished by each <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. It is not possible to explain the world of phenomena while neglecting the phenomena that make up the world. "All that exists, as contemplated by the <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10321a.htm">mind</a>, forms one large system or complex fact. . . . Like a short-sighted reader, its eye pores closely, and travels slowly, over the awful volume which lies open for its inspection. . . . These various partial views or abstractions . . . are called <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> . . . they proceed on the principle of a division of labour. . . . And further the comprehension of the bearings of one <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> on another, and the use of each to each, and the location of them all, with one another, this belongs, I conceive, to a sort of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> distinct from all of them, and in some sense, a <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, which is my own conception of what is meant by philosophy" (Newman, "Idea of a University", Discourse III, iii, iv, 44 sqq.).</p>

<p>There is, of course, the pedagogical problem; how shall philosophy maintain its control over the ever-widening field of the various <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>? In reply, we may cite the words of Cardinal Mercier, a prominent leader in the neo-Scholastic movement: "As a matter of fact", he declares, "the difficulty is a serious one, and one may say in general terms, that it is not going to be solved by any one man. As the domain of fact and observation grows larger and larger, individual effort becomes less competent to survey and master it all: hence the necessity of co-operative effort to supply what is lacking in the work of isolated investigators; hence too the need of union between the synthetic mind and the analytic, in order to secure, by daily contact and joint action, the harmonious development of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>". ("La philosophie n&eacute;o-scholastique" in "Revue n&eacute;o-scholastique", 1894, 17).</p>

<h3 id="D">Innovations in doctrinal matters</h3>

<p>Once it turned its attention to modern fashions of thought, neo-Scholasticism found itself face to face with problems of which <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> philosophy had not the slightest suspicion or at any rate did not furnish a solution. It had to bear the brunt of conflict between its own principles and those of the systems in vogue, especially of Positivism and Criticism. And it had to take up, from its own point of view, the questions which are favourite topics of discussion in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of our time. How far then, one may ask, has neo-Scholasticism been affected by modern thought? First of all, as to <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>: in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> its claim to validity met with no challenge, whereas, in the twentieth century, its very possibility is at stake and, to defend it against the concerted attack of Hume and <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> and Comte, the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> significance of such concepts as being, substance, absolute, cause, potency, and act must be explained and upheld. It is further needful to show that, in a very real sense, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not unknowable; to rebut the charges preferred by Herbert Spencer against the traditional <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="06608b.htm">God's existence</a>; to deal with the materials furnished by ethnography and the history of <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a>; and to study the various forms which monism and immanentism nowadays assume.</p>

<p>Cosmology can well afford to insist on the traditional theory of <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and form, provided it pay due attention to the findings of physics, chemistry, crystallography, and mineralogy, and meet the objections of <a href="02053a.htm">atomism</a> and dynamism, theories which, in the opinion of scientific authority, are less satisfactory as explanations of natural phenomena than the hylomorphism (q.v.) of the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. The theory also of qualities, once the subject of ridicule, is nowadays endorsed by some of the most prominent scientists. In <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> especially the progressive spirit of neo-Scholasticism makes itself felt. The theory of the substantial union of body and <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, as an interpretation of biological, psychical, and psycho-physiological facts, is far more serviceable than the extreme spiritualism of <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a> on the one hand and the Positivism of modern thinkers on the other. As Wundt admits, the results of investigation in physiological <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> do not square either with materialism or with <a href="05169a.htm">dualism</a> whether of the <a href="12159a.htm">Platonic</a> or of the <a href="04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> type; it is only <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> <a href="01526a.htm">animism</a>, which brings <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> into connexion with biology, that can offer a satisfactory metaphysical interpretation of experimental <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a>. So vigorous indeed has been the growth of <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> that each of its offshoots is developing in its own way: such is the case with criteriology, &aelig;sthetics, didactics, pedagogy, and the numerous ramifications of applied <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a>. Along these various lines, unknown to <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> philosophy, neo-Scholasticism is working energetically and successfully. Its criteriology is altogether new: the older <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> handled the problem of certitude from the <a href="04674a.htm">deductive</a> point of view; <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> could not have misshaped the faculties with which He endowed the mind in order that it might attain to <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Neo-Scholasticism, on the other hand, proceeds by analysis and introspection it states the problem in the terms which, since <a href="08603a.htm">Kant's</a> day, are the only admissible terms, but as against the <a href="08603a.htm">Kantian</a> criticism it finds the solution in a rational dogmatism. Its &aelig;sthetics holds a middle course between the extreme subjectivism of many modern thinkers who would reduce the beautiful to a mere impression, and the no less extreme objectivism which the Greeks of old maintained. It is equally at home in the field of experimental <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> which investigates the correlation between conscious phenomena and their physiological accompaniments; in fact, its theory of the substantial union of body and <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> implies as its corollary a "bodily resonance" corresponding to each psychical process.</p>

<p>The <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and principles which the modern <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> has drawn from experience find their adequate explanation in neo-Scholastic <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; thus, the <a href="08082b.htm">intuitive</a> method, so largely accepted at present as an essential element in <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, is based on the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> theory that nothing enters the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> save through the avenue of sense. In the study of <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> problems, neo-Scholasticism holds fast to the vital teachings that prevailed in the thirteenth century, but at the same time it takes into account the historical and <a href="14115a.htm">sociological</a> data which explain the varying application of principles in successive ages. In view of contemporary systems which, on a purely experimental basis, attempt to set aside all moral imperatives and <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of value, it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to insist on the older concepts of <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, of finality and <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> &#151; a need which is easily supplied by neo-Scholastic ethics. As to <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a>, the most perfect part of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> great constructive work and therefore that which has been least modified in the course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>. Its positions still call for defence against the objections of writers like Mill, who regard the syllogism as a "solemn farce". Accordingly, with due consideration for modern modes of thinking, neo-Scholasticism adapts the teaching of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> to actual conditions. Even as regards the relations between philosophy and religion, there are important changes to note. For the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> mind in the Western world, philosophy and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> were identical until about the twelfth century. In the thirteenth the line of demarcation was clearly drawn, but philosophy was still treated as the preliminary training for <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. This is no longer the case; neo-Scholasticism assigns to philosophy a value of its own as a rational explanation of the world, on a par in this respect with Positivism and other systems; and it welcomes all who are bent on honest research, whether their aim be purely <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> or apologetic.</p>

<p>Parallel with these modifications are those which affect the pedagogical phase of the movement. The methods of teaching <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the thirteenth century were too closely dependent on the culture of that age; hence they have been replaced by modern procedures, curricula, and means of propagation. It would be ill-advised to wrap neo-Scholastic <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> envelopes, e.g. to write books on the plan of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> "Summae" or the "Quodlibetal Questions" that were current in the thirteenth century. Without at all lessening its force, syllogistic demonstration gains in attractiveness when its essential characteristics are retained and clothed about with modern forms of presentation. In this connexion, the use of living languages as a means of exposition has obvious advantages and finds favour with many of those who are best qualified to judge.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Appreciation</h2>

<p>By interesting itself in modern questions, interpreting the results of scientific research and setting forth its principles for thorough discussion, neo-Scholasticism has compelled attention: it has to be reckoned with. Among non-Catholics, many leaders of thought have frankly acknowledged that its methods and doctrines deserve to be examined anew. Men like Boutroux admit that <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> system may well serve as an offset to <a href="08603a.htm">Kantism</a> and evolution (Aristote, Etudes d'histoire et de philosophie, Paris, 1901, 202). Paulsen ("Kant der Philosoph des Protestantismus" in "Kantstudien", 1899) and Eucken ("Thomas von Aquino u. Kant, Ein Kampf zweier Welten", loc. cit., 1901) declare that neo-Thomism is the rival of <a href="08603a.htm">Kantism</a> and that the conflict between them is the "clash of two worlds". Harnack ("Lehrbuch d. Dogmengesch.", III, 3rd. ed., 327), Seeberg ("Realencyklop&auml;die f. Prot. Theol." 5. v. "Scholastik") and others protest against those who underrate the value of scholastic <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.</p>

<p>Among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, neo-Scholasticism gains ground day by day. It is doing away with <a href="11257a.htm">Ontologism</a>, <a href="15013a.htm">Traditionalism</a>, the <a href="05169a.htm">Dualism</a> of Gunther, and the exaggerated <a href="14229a.htm">Spiritualism</a> of <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a>. It is free from the weaknesses of Pragmatism and <a href="15505a.htm">Voluntarism</a>, systems in which some thinkers have vainly sought the reconciliation of their philosophy and their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. Neo-Scholasticism has a character of permanence as <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> itself has; but it is destined in its development to keep up with scientific progress. Like everything that lives, it must advance; arrested growth would mean decay.</p>

<h2 id="section4">The leaders and their work</h2>

<p>The neo-Scholastic movement was inaugurated by such writers as <a href="13453a.htm">Sanseverino</a> (1811-65) and <a href="04379d.htm">Cornoldi</a> (1822-92) in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; Gonzalez (1831-92) in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>; <a href="08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a> (1811-83) and St&ouml;ckl (1823-95) in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; de San (1832-1904), Dupont, and Lepidi in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>; Farges and Dormet de Vorges (1910) in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, who with other scholars carried on the work of restoration before the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> gave it solemn approval and encouragement. <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, in various letters, recognized its importance; but it was the encyclical "AEterni Patris" of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (4 Aug., 1879) that imparted to neo-Scholasticism its definitive character and quickened its development. This document sets forth the principles by which the movement is to be guided in a progressive spirit, and by which the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is to take on new life in its modern environment. "If," says the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, "there be anything that the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> treated with excessive subtlety or with insufficient consideration, or that is at variance with well founded teachings of later date, or is otherwise improbable, we by no means intend that it shall be proposed to our age for imitation. . . . We certainly do not blame those learned and energetic men who turn to the profit of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> their own assiduous labours and erudition as well as the results of modern investigation; for we are fully aware that all this goes to the advancement of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>."</p>

<p>In <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the movement was vigorous from the start. The Accademia di San Tommaso, founded in 1874, published, up to 1891, a review entitled "La Scienza Italiana". Numerous works were produced by Zigliara (1833-93), <a href="13486a.htm">Satolli</a> (1839-1909), <a href="09215a.htm">Liberatore</a> (1810-92), Barberis (1847-96), Schiffini (1841-1906), de Maria, Talamo, Lorenzelli, Ballerini, Matussi, and others. The Italian writers at first laid special emphasis on the metaphysical features of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, without paying sufficient attention to the <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> or to the history of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Recently, however, this situation has undergone a change which promises excellent results.</p>

<p>From <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> the movement spread into the other <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> countries and found supporters in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> such as <a href="08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a>, St&ouml;ckl, the authors of the "Philosophia Lacensis", published at <a href="09658a.htm">Maria Laach</a> by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (<a href="11739b.htm">Pesch</a>, Hontheim, Cathrein), Gutberlet, Commer, Willmann, Kaufmann, Glossner, Grabmann, and Schneid. These scholars have made valuable contributions to the history of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, especially that of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. St&ouml;ckl led the way with his "Geschichte d. Philosophie des Mittelalters" (Mainz, 1864-66). Ehrle and <a href="04719a.htm">Denifle</a> founded in 1885 the "Archiv f&uuml;r Literatur u. Kirchengesch. d. Mittelalters", and the latter edited the monumental <a href="03637a.htm">"Chartularium"</a> of the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. In 1891, Von Hertling and B&auml;umker began the publication of their "Beitr&auml;ge zur Gesch. d. Phil. des Mittelalters".</p>

<p>Belgium has been particularly favoured. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> established (1891) at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> the "Institut de philosophie" for the special purpose of teaching the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> together with history and the natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>. The Institute was placed in charge of Mgr (now <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Mercier whose "Cours de philosophie" has been translated into the principal languages of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, besides those already mentioned, Vallet, Gardair, Fonsegrive, and Piat have taken a prominent part in the movement; in <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> (Amsterdam) de Groot; in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> (Freiburg), Mandonnet; in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Orti y Lara, Urr&aacute;buru, G&oacute;mez Izquierdo; in Mexico, Garcia; in <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, Santroul; in <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, Kiss and Pecsi; in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, Clarke, Maher, John Rickaby, Joseph Rickaby, Boedder (Stonyhurst Series); in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> Coppens, <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, Brother Chrysostom, and the professors at the Catholic University (Shanahan, Turner, and Pace).</p>

<p>Neo-Scholasticism has been endorsed by four <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congresses: <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1891); <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a> (1895); Freiburg (1897); <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> (1900). A considerable number of reviews have served as its exponents: "Divus Thomas" (1879-1903); "Rivista Italiana di filosofia neo-scolastica" (Florence, since 1909); "Annales de Philosophie Chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, since 1830); "Revue n&eacute;o-scolastique de Philosophie" (Louvain, since 1894); "Revue de Philosophie" (Paris, since 1900);" Revue des Sciences philosophiques et th&eacute;ologiques" (Kain, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, since 1907); "Revue Thomiste" (Paris, since 1893); "Philosophisches Jahrbuch f&uuml;r Philosophie und spekulative Theologie" (Paderborn, since 1887); "St. Thomas Bl&auml;tter" (Ratisbon, since 1888); B&ouml;lcseleti-Foly&oacute;irat (Budapest, since 1886);" Revista Lulliana" (Barcelona, since 1901); "Cienza Tomista" (Madrid, since 1910). In addition to these, various periodical publications not specially devoted to philosophy have given neo-Scholasticism their cordial support.</p>
