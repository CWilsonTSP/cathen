<p>A form of religion intermediate between <a href="02730a.htm">Brahminism</a> and <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, originated in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> in pre-Christian times, and has maintained its <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> attitude towards <a href="02730a.htm">Brahminism</a> down to the present day. The name is derived from <em>jina</em>, conqueror, one of the epithets popularly applied to the reputed founder of the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. Jainism bears a striking resemblance to <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> in its monastic system, its <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> teachings, its sacred texts, and in the story of its founder. This closeness of resemblance has led not a few scholars&mdash;such as Lassen, Weber, Wilson, Tiele, Barth&mdash;to look upon Jainism as an offshoot of <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> and to place its origin some centuries later than the time of <a href="03028b.htm">Buddha</a>. But the prevailing view today&mdash;that of B&uuml;hler, Jacobi, Hopkins, and others&mdash;is that Jainism in its origin is independent of <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> and, perhaps, is the more ancient of the two. The many points of similarity between the two <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> are explained by the <a href="04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> of both to a common source, namely the teachings and practices of ascetic, monastic <a href="02730a.htm">Brahminism</a>. Of the reputed founder of Jainism we have but few details, and most of these are so like what we read of the beginnings of <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> that one is strongly led to suspect that here at least one is dealing with a variation of the Buddha-legend. According to Jainist tradition, the founder lived in the sixth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, being either a contemporary or a precursor of <a href="03028b.htm">Buddha</a>. His family name was Jnatriputra (in Prakrit, Nattaputta), but, like Gotama, he was <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the laudatory names of <a href="03028b.htm">Buddha</a>, the enlightened, Mahavira, the great hero, and Jina, the conqueror. These last two epithets came to be his distinctive titles, while the name <a href="03028b.htm">Buddha</a> was associated almost exclusively with Gotama. Like <a href="03028b.htm">Buddha</a>, Jina was the son of a local raja who held sway over a small district in the neighbourhood of Benares. While still a young man he felt the emptiness of a life of pleasure, and gave up his home and princely station to become an ardent follower of the Brahmin ascetics. If we may trust the Jainist scriptures, he carried the principle of <a href="10578b.htm">self-mortification</a> to the extent that he went about naked, unsheltered from the sun, rain, and winds, and lived on the rudest vegetarian fare, practising incredible <a href="05789c.htm">fasts</a>. Accepting the principle of the Brahmin ascetics, that <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> is by personal effort alone, he took the <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> step of rejecting as useless the Vedas and the <a href="15318a.htm">Vedic</a> rites. For this attitude towards the Brahmin traditions he was repudiated as a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>. He gathered eleven disciples around him, and went about preaching his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Like <a href="03028b.htm">Buddha</a> he made many converts, whom he organized under a monastic rule of life. Associated with them were many who accepted his teaching in theory, but who in practice stopped short of the monastic life of extreme asceticism. These were the lay Jainists, who, like the lay <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhists</a>, contributed to the support of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The Jainists seem never to have been so numerous as the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhists</a>. Though they claim a membership of over a million believers, <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> included, recent statistics of <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> show that their number is not greater than half a million. On the question of the propriety of going about naked, the Jainist <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> have for ages been split into two <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>. The White-Robed Sect, whose <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. are clothed in white garments, is the more numerous, flourishing chiefly in N. W. <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>. To this <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> belong a few communities of Jainist <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The naked ascetics, forming the other <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, are strongest in the South of <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>, but even here they have largely restricted the custom of nakedness to the time of eating. As the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> creed is summed up in three words, <a href="03028b.htm">Buddha</a>, the Law, the Order, so the Jainist creed consists of the so-called three jewels, Right Belief, Right Knowledge, Right Conduct. Right Belief embraces <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in Jina as the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> teacher of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> and the acceptance of the Jainist scriptures as his authoritative teaching. These scriptures are less extensive, less varied, than the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a>, and, while resembling the latter to a large degree, lay great stress on bodily <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a>. The canon of the White-robed Sect consists of forty-five Agamas, or sacred texts, in the Prakrit tongue. Jacobi, who has translated some of these texts in the "Sacred Books of the East", is of the opinion that they cannot be older than 300 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> According to Jainist tradition, they were preceded by an ancient canon of fourteen so-called Purvas, which have totally disappeared. With the Jainist, "Right Knowledge" embraces the religious view of life together with the end of man, while "Right Conduct" is concerned with the main <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> and with the ascetic, monastic system.</p>

<p>The Jainist, like the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> and the <a href="11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> Brahmin, takes for granted the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Karma and its implied rebirths. He, too, views every form of earthly, bodily existence as misery. Freedom from rebirth is thus the goal after which he aspires. But, while the <a href="11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> Brahmin and the primitive <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> looked for the realization of the end in the extinction of conscious, individual existence (absorption in Brahma, Nirvana), the Jainist has always tenaciously held to the primitive traditional <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in a final abode of bliss, where the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, liberated from the necessity of rebirth on earth, enjoys forever a spiritual, conscious existence. To attain this end, the Jainist, like the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> and the <a href="11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> Brahmin, holds that the traditional gods can aid but little. The existence of the gods is not denied, but their worship is held to be of no avail and is thus abandoned. Salvation is to be obtained by personal effort alone. To reach the longed-for goal, it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to purify the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of all that binds it to a bodily existence, so that it shall aspire purely and solely after a spiritual life in <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. This is accomplished by the life of severe <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> of which Jina set the example. Twelve years of ascetic life as a Jainist <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> and eight rebirths are <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to constitute the purgatorial preparation for the Jainist <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>. While the Jains are not worshippers of the <a href="07358b.htm">Hindu</a> gods, they erect imposing <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> to Jina and other <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> teachers. The images of these Jainist <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> are adorned with lights and flowers, and the faithful walk around them while reciting sacred <em>mantras</em>. Jainist worship is thus little more than a veneration of a few <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and heroes of the past.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On its <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> side&mdash;the sphere of Right Conduct&mdash;Jainism is largely at one with <a href="02730a.htm">Brahminism</a> and <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>. There are, however, a few differences in the application of the principle of not killing. The sacredness of all kinds of life implied in the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a> has been more scrupulously observed in practice by the Jain than by the Brahmin or the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a>. The Brahmin tolerates the slaughter of animals for food, to provide offerings for the sacrifice, or to show hospitality to a guest; the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> does not scruple to eat meat prepared for a banquet; but the Jain reprobates meat-food without exception as involving the unlawful taking of life. For similar reasons the Jain does not content himself with straining his drinking water and with remaining at home during the rainy season, when the ground is swarming with lower forms of life, but when he goes forth, he wears a veil before his mouth, and carries a broom with which he sweeps the ground before him to avoid destruction of insect life. The Jainist ascetic allows himself to be bitten by gnats and mosquitoes rather than risk their destruction by brushing them away. Hospitals for animals have been a prominent feature of Jainist benevolence, bordering at times on absurdity. For example, in 1834 there existed in Kutch a temple <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> which supported 5000 rats. With all this scrupulous regard for animal life the Jain differs from the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> in his view of the lawfulness of religious <a href="14326b.htm">suicide</a>. According to Jainist ethics a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> who has practised twelve years of severe asceticism, or who has found after long trial that he cannot keep his lower nature in control, may hasten his end by self-destruction.</p>
