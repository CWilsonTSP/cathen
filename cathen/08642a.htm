<p>(KILMORENSIS)</p>

<p><a href="05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, includes almost all Cavan and about half of Leitrim. It also extends into Fermanagh, and has half a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> in both Meath (Kilmainham Wood) and Sligo (Ballintrillick). It is accordingly seen to be roughly coincident with ancient Breffney, embracing both Breffney O'Rourke and Breffney O'Reilly. St. Fedlemid, or Felim, who flourished in the early part of the sixth century, is the first known <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kilmore. He is patron of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and his <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 9 August, the day of his death. A holy well near the old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Kilmore still bears his name. From Hugh O' Finn, appointed 1136, to Andrew MacBrady, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1445, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this see were often styled Episcopi Brefinioe; and no <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> outside of Breffney is known to have ever claimed <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over it. With a hiatus or two, all its rulers during this period have been ascertained. Many of them are also sometimes called <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Triburna, probably from the name of a village near Butlersbridge, close to which village was the episcopal church and most probably the episcopal residence. The spot now marked by the graveyard of Urney (Triburna) contains some remains of this very ancient structure.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Towards the middle of the fifteenth century, the above-mentioned Andrew MacBrady (1445-55) rebuilt on a much larger scale the primitive <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Fedlemid, situated about seven miles due south of Triburna, and in 1454, with the approval of <a href="11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a>, made it his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Thenceforth this church (cill mor, i.e. great church) imparted its name to the surrounding <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> and also to the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, just as the church of Triburna did before, or just as the town of Cavan has given its name to the whole County of Cavan. Bishop MacBrady lived at Kilmore. During the penal times many of his successors, in striving to discharge their sacred functions, suffered untold hardships. Richard Brady (1580-1607), for instance, was three times thrown into chains. In 1601 the friary of Multifarnam, in which he sought refuge, was burned over his head by the English soldiers. As late as the middle of the eighteenth century, Bishop Andrew Campbell (1753-1769 or 1770), to escape the dangers that beset him, had to go on his visitations disguised as a Highland piper. A beautiful oil-painting representing him so attired is preserved in the dining-room of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college at Cavan. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of Kilmore originally consisted, besides the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, of eleven canons, together with a dean and an <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. But in 1636 the latter two titles alone remained. Of later years they too have wholly disappeared. The seal of the ancient chapter of "Tirbrina" was dug up at Urney about sixty years ago.</p>

<p>In 1636 Kilmore was described as having forty <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In July, 1704, in compliance with the provisions of the act passed the previous year for "registering the popish <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>," thirty-nine Kilmore "popish <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>" gave in their names. "Curates or assistants" were excluded, being placed on the same footing as regulars, and "had to depart out of this Kingdom before the 20th July" under divers pains and penalties. It is worth noting that twelve of these thirty-nine <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> had been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="12169b.htm">Oliver Plunket</a>, the saintly <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Armagh; and one of them, the Rev. Owen McHugh of Killesher, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1682, by <a href="08021a.htm">Pope Innocent XI</a>. Three <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> claim to have been founded by <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> in person: Drumlease, Cloonclare, and Oughteragh (now Ballinamore). Father Maguire, a well-known controversialist, died <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the last-mentioned place. Drumlease derives its name (<em>drum-lias</em>, ridge of the huts) from the sheds <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> is said to have raised there; and the neighbouring village of Dromahair was for long called <em>Carrig-Padruig</em>, or Patrick's Rock. The saint, struck by the scenic beauty of the surroundings, designed to establish there his <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> see. For twenty years he left his foster-son and destined successor, Benignus, in charge of it; and it was only towards the end of his life that he reluctantly changed his intention, and adopted Armagh. In the seventh century the diocese gave illustrious names to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, to the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Mullagh we owe <a href="08639a.htm">St. Kilian</a> (d. 688), the Apostle of Franconia; to Killinkere, St. Ultan (d. 656); and to Templeport, <a href="01233d.htm">St. Aidan</a>, or Mogue (d. 651). Inishmagrath, in the next century, was probably the birthplace of the scholarly <a href="06655a.htm">St. Tighernach</a>; Ballaghameehan, in the previous century, was under the care of St. Molassius (or Laserian, d. 563), the founder of Devenish; his copy of the Gospels, which was encased in a <a href="12762a.htm">reliquary</a> about the year 1001, is now in the Dublin Museum.</p>

<p>The most famous religious house in Kilmore was St. Mary's friary in Cavan town, founded by the O'Reillys in 1300. The <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were the first religious to be introduced; in 1393 they left and were replaced by <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. After the Suppression, in the time of James I, the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was converted into a courthouse; in the beginning of the last century it was used as a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> place of worship. The crumbling tower of this church is all that remains of it. In its graveyard the remains of three noted <a href="08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> were <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a>: <a href="11253a.htm">Owen Roe O'Neill</a>, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> noblest soldier, who died at Clough Oughter in 1649; Hugh O'Reilly, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kilmore (1625-28), <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Armagh (1629-52), and founder of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Confederacy; most probably also Myles O'Reilly, surnamed the Slasher, <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> greatest swordsman. Their graves were purposely concealed through fear of <a href="04748c.htm">desecration</a>, and cannot now be pointed out. The other chieftain <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Breffney, the O'Rourkes, founded Creevelea (<em>creeve</em>, branch, and <em>liath</em>, grey) beside Dromahair in 1508, and brought thither the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. A beautiful chased silver <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a>, bearing an inscription declaring that it was presented to this <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1619 by Mary the wife of "Thaddeus Ruaire," is still in use in Butlersbridge <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Cavan. Creevelea, as the annals declare and as its ruined <a href="03572b.htm">chancel</a> and <a href="04060a.htm">cloisters</a> attest, was one of the most imposing of the many noble structures that the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> had. The <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of Drumlane, established before 550, was confiscated in 1670. Its round tower is still in a good state of preservation. An <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> yet traceable beside St. Fedlemid's church in Kilmore is said to date from the sixth century, and to have been founded by St. Columbcille. On Trinity Island, two miles to the west of it, the <a href="12387b.htm">White Canons of St. Norbert</a> established in 1237 or 1239 the Abbey of <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>. It was confiscated in 1570. A beautifully carved doorway, transferred from its ruins, now adorns the vestry of Kilmore <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the memorial church of the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> Bedell.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and episcopal palace and gardens are located on the sites once sanctified by St. Fedlemid and St. Columbcille. At Mounterconnaught, at Ballylinch in Kilmore, and also at Drumlumman there existed as late as the seventeenth century <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> for the poor. They were dissolved, says Archdall, though chargeable with no crime but that of being endowed; in 1605 they were granted by King James I to Sir Edward Moore, ancestor of the Earls of Drogheda. Kilmainham Wood, County Meath, a preceptory belonging to the <a href="14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a>, was erected by the Preston <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> some time in the thirteenth century. On the shores of Lough Melvin in Ballaghameehan, Leitrim, St. Tighernagh founded a <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> for his mother St. Mella, who died before 787. It was known as Doiremelle. He also built for himself the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Killachad somewhere in County Cavan. On Church Island in the lake just mentioned St. Sinell (d. 548), <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> bell-founder, had a retreat called Kildareis. Finally on Lackagh Mountain, near Drumkeeran, St. Natalis (d. 563) founded the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Kilnaile, whose beehive cells may still be traced on the bleak mountain top amid the rocks and brown heather.</p>

<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1901 numbered 109,319 &mdash; a decline of nearly one-third since the census of 1871 &mdash; and its non-Catholic population, 24,447, a somewhat greater decrease. It has 42 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> and usually 104 or 105 <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. St. Patrick's College, Cavan, opened by Dr. Conaty in 1874, replaces St. Augustine's Seminary, established by Dr. Browne in 1839; it is one of the finest <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> buildings in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The <a href="12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, brought to Cavan town in 1861, care for an industrial <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> or <a href="11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. In 1872 they established a second <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at Ballyjamesduff. The <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> have <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> at Belturbet, Ballinamore, and Cootehill. All the communities are in charge of technical and primary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. Intermediate <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys are at Manorhamilton and Ballyjamesduff. The Most Rev. Andrew Boylan, C.SS.R. (b. 1842), a native of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kilmore in 1907, died on 25 March, 1910.</p>
