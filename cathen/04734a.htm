<p>(D<font size=-2>ENYS VAN</font> L<font size=-2>EEUWEN,</font> also L<font size=-2>EUW</font> or L<font size=-2>IEUWE</font>).</p>

<p>Born in 1402 in that part of the <a href="02395a.htm">Belgian</a> province of <a href="09260a.htm">Limburg</a> which was formerly comprised in the county of Hesbaye; died 12 March, 1471. His birthplace was Ryckel, a small village a few miles from Saint-Trond, whence ancient writers have often surnamed him Ryckel or &#224; Ryckel. His <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, historians say, were of noble rank; he himself says, however, that when a child he kept his <a href="11478c.htm">father's</a> sheep. His remarkable aptitude for <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> pursuits and his eagerness to learn induced his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> to give him a liberal <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and they sent him to a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Saint-Trond. In 1415 he went to another <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Zwolle (Overijssel), which was then of great repute and attracted many students from various parts of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He there entered upon the study of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and became acquainted with the principles and practice of <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>, which the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>, John Cele, a very holy man, himself taught. Shortly after the <a href="12676c.htm">rector's</a> death (1417) he returned home, having learnt all that the masters of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> could teach him. His feverish quest for human <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> and the success his uncommon <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> powers had rapidly obtained seem, according to his own account, to have rather dulled his <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. Nevertheless a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> leaning to cloistral life, which had taken root in his mind from the early age of ten and had grown stronger during his stay at Zwolle, finally triumphed over worldly <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> and the <a href="08050b.htm">instincts</a> of nature, and at the age of eighteen he determined to acquire the "science of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>" in <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno's</a> order</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Having applied for admittance at the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="13110a.htm">Roermond</a> (Dutch Limburg), he was refused because he had not reached the age (twenty years) required by the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the order; but the prior gave him hopes that he would be received later on, and advised him to continue meanwhile his <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies. So he went forthwith to the then celebrated <a href="04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a>, where he remained three years, studying <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>, etc. After taking his degree of Master of Arts, he returned to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="13110a.htm">Roermond</a> and this time was admitted (1423). In his cell Denys gave himself up heart and <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> to the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> life, performing all with his characteristic earnestness and strength of will, and letting his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> carry him even far beyond what the rule demanded. Thus, over and above the time&mdash;about eight hours&mdash;every <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> spends daily in hearing and saying <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>, reciting <a href="11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, and in other devotional exercises, he was wont to say the whole <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>&mdash;his favourite <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> book&mdash;or at least a great part of it, and he passed long hours in meditation and contemplation; nor did material occupations usually hinder him from <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a>. Reading and writing took up the rest of his time. The list he drew up, about two years before his death, of some of the books he had read while a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> bears the names of all the principal <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers down to his time. He had read, he says, every summa and every chronicle, many commentaries on the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, and the works of a great number of Greek, and especially <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a>, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and he had studied the whole of canon as well as <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>. His favourite author was <a href="05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>. His quick <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> seized the author's meaning at first reading and his wonderful memory retained without much effort all that he had ever read.</p>

<p>It seems marvellous that, spending so much time in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he should have been able to peruse so vast a number of books; but what passes all comprehension is that he found time to write, and to write so much that his works might make up twenty-five folio volumes. No other pen, whose productions have come down to us, has been so prolific. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that he took not more than three hours' sleep a night, and that he was known to spend sometimes whole nights in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and study. There is evidence, too, that his pen was a swift one. Nevertheless the mystery still remains insolvable, and all the more so that, besides the occupations already mentioned, he had, at least for some time, others which will be presently noted, and which alone would have been enough to absorb the attention of any ordinary man. He began (1434) by commenting the Psalms and then went on to comment the whole of the Old and the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. He commented also the works of <a href="02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, John Climacus, as well as those of, or attributed to, <a href="05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, and translated Cassian into easier Latin. It was after seeing one of his commentaries that <a href="05601a.htm">Pope Eugene IV</a> exclaimed: "Let <a href="03744a.htm">Mother Church</a> rejoice to have such a son!" He wrote <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises, such as his "Summa Fidei Orthodox&aelig;"; "Compendium Theologicum", "De Lumine Christian&aelig; Theori&aelig;", "De Laudibus B. V. Mari&aelig;", and "De Pr&aelig;conio B. V. Mari&aelig;" (in both of which treatises he upholds the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Immaculate Conception), "De quatuor Novissimus", etc.; <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatises, such as his "Compendium philosophicum", "De venustate mundi et pulchritudine Dei" (a most remarkable &aelig;sthetic dissertation), "De ente et essenti&#226;", etc.; a great many treatises relating to <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, asceticism, church discipline, liturgy, etc.; sermons and <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> for all the <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and festivals of the year, etc. His writings, taken as a whole, show him to be a compiler rather than an original thinker; they contain more unction and <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> than deep speculation. He was no innovator, no builder of systems, and especially no quibbler. Indeed he had a decided dislike for metaphysical subtleties of no positive use, for he was of far too practical a turn of mind to waste time in idle dialectic niceties, and sought only to do immediate good to <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> and tend their spiritual needs, drawing them away from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and guiding and urging them on in the path to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As an expounder of Scripture, he generally does no more than reproduce or recapitulate what other commentators had said before him. If his commentaries bring no light to modern <a href="05692b.htm">exegetics</a> they are at least an abundant mine of <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> reflections. As a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> he is a servile follower of no one master and belongs to no particular <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. Although an admirer of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and <a href="14663b.htm">Aquinas</a>, he is neither an <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> nor a <a href="14698b.htm">Thomist</a> in the usual sense of the words, but seems inclined rather to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a> of <a href="05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, and <a href="02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>. As a <a href="14621a.htm">mystical</a> writer he is akin to Hugh and <a href="13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a>, St. Bonaventure, and the writers of the Wildesheim School, and in his treatises may be found summed up the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, especially of <a href="05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, and of Eckart, <a href="07238c.htm">Suso</a>, <a href="13280c.htm">Ruysbroeck</a>, and other writers of the German and <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a> Schools. He has been called the last of the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>, and he is so in the sense that he is the last important <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> writer, and that his works may be considered to form a vast encyclopedia, a complete summary of the <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> teaching of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; this is their primary characteristic and their chief merit.</p>

<p>His renown for learning and especially for saintliness, drew upon him considerable intercourse with the outer world. He was consulted as an <a href="11264c.htm">oracle</a> by men of different social standing, from <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and princes downwards; they flocked to his cell, and numberless letters came to him from all parts of the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The topic of such correspondence was often the grievous state of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, i.e. the evils ensuing from relaxed <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> and discipline and from the invasion of <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a>. Deploring these evils he exerted himself to the utmost, like all <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of that day, to counteract them. For that purpose, soon after the fall of <a href="04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> (1453), impressed by revelations <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> made to him concerning the terrific woes threatening <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, he wrote a letter to all the princes of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, urging them to amend their lives, to cease their dissensions, and to join in <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against their common enemy, the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. A general council being in his eyes the only means of procuring serious reform, he exhorted all <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> and others to unite their efforts to bring it about. He wrote also a series of treatises, laying down rules of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> living for <a href="04049b.htm">churchmen</a> and for <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> of every rank and profession. "De doctrin&#226; et regulis vit&aelig; Christian&aelig;", the most important of these treatises, was written at the request, and for the use, of the famous <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> preacher John Brugman. These and others which he wrote of a similar import, inveighing against the vices and abuses of the time, insisting on the need of a general reform, and showing how it was to be effected, give a curious insight into the customs, the state of <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life of that period. To refute <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> he wrote two treatises: "Contra perfidiam Mahometi", at the request of <a href="11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a>. The latter, named <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> by <a href="11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> to reform the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and to preach a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>, took Denys with him during a part, if not the whole, of his progress (Jan., 1451-March, 1452), and received from his tongue and his pen valuable assistance, especially in the work of reforming <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and of rooting out magical and <a href="14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices. This mission was not the only charge which drew Denys from his much-loved cell. He was for some time (about 1459) <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> of his <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and in July, 1466, was appointed to superintend the building of a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>. A three- years' struggle against ;the inextricable difficulties of the new foundation broke down his health, already impaired by a long life of ceaseless work and privations, and he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to Roermond in 1469. His treatise "De Meditatione" bears the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the same year and was the last he wrote.</p>

<p>The immense literary activity of Denys had never been detrimental to his spirit of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. On the contrary he always found in study a powerful help to contemplation; the more he <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a>, the more he <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a>. While still a <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> he had <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> which lasted two or three hours, and later on they lasted sometimes seven hours and more. Indeed, towards the end of his life he could not hear the singing of "Veni Sancte Spiritus" or some verses of the Psalms, nor converse on certain devotional subjects without being lifted off the ground in a rapture of Divine <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. Hence posterity has surnamed him "Doctor ecstaticus". During his <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> many things were revealed to him which he made known only when it could profit others, and the same may be said of what he learnt from the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, who appeared to him very frequently, seeking relief through his powerful intercession. Loving <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> as he did, it is no wonder that he should have become odious to the great hater of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. His <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> responded to his learning, and his <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a>, especially with regard to food and sleep, far excelled what the generality of men can attain to. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that in point of physical austerities, virtue was assisted by a strong constitution, for he was a man of athletic build and had, as he said, "an iron head and a brazen stomach".</p>

<p>During the last two years of his life he suffered intensely and with heroic patience from paralysis, stone, and other infirmities. He had been a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> for forty-eight years when he died at the age of sixty-nine. Upon his remains being disinterred one hundred and thirty-seven years after, day for day (12 March, 1608), his skull emitted a sweet perfume and the fingers he had most used in writing, i.e. the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, were found in a perfect state of preservation. Although the cause of his <a href="02364b.htm">beatification</a> has never yet been introduced, <a href="06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>, and other writers of note style him "Blessed"; his life is in the "Acta Sanctorum" of the <a href="02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> (12 March), and his name is to be found in many <a href="09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>. An accurate edition of all his works still extant, which will comprise forty-one quarto volumes, is now being issued by the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> Press at <a href="14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.</p>
