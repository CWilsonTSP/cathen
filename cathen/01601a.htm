<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The scope of this article takes in those compositions which profess to have been written either by Biblical personages or men in intimate relations with them. Such known works as the Shepherd of Hermas, the <a href="02299a.htm">Epistle of Barnabas</a>, the <a href="04779a.htm">Didache (Teaching) of the Twelve Apostles</a>, and the <a href="03279a.htm">Apostolic Canons</a> and Constitutions, though formerly apocryphal, really belong to patristic literature, and are considered independently. It has been deemed better to classify the Biblical apocrypha according to their origin, instead of following the misleading division of the apocrypha of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="14530a.htm">New Testaments.</a> Broadly speaking, the apocrypha of Jewish origin are coextensive with what are styled of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and those of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> origin with the apocrypha of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.</p>

<h3>Name and notion</h3>

<p>Etymologically, the derivation of Apocrypha is very simple, being from the Greek <em>apokryphos</em>, hidden, and corresponding to the neuter plural of the adjective. The use of the singular, "Apocryphon", is both legitimate and convenient, when referring to a single work. When we would attempt to seize the literary sense attaching to the word, the task is not so easy. It has been employed in various ways by early patristic writers, who have sometimes entirely lost sight of the etymology. Thus it has the connotation "uncanonical" with some of them. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> evidently applied the term to all quasi-scriptural books which in his estimation lay outside the canon of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, and the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant Reformers</a>, following Jerome's catalogue of <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Scriptures &#151; one which was at once <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> and singular among the <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> &#151; applied the title Apocrypha to the excess of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> canon of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> over that of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Naturally, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> refuse to admit such a denomination, and we employ "deuterocanonical" to designate this literature, which non-Catholics conventionally and improperly <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> as the "Apocrypha". (See <a href="03267a.htm">CANON OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</a>.)</p>

<p>The original and proper sense of the term <em>apocryphal</em> as applied to the pretended sacred books was early obscured. But a clue to it may be recognized in the so-called Fourth Book of Esdras, which relates that Estrus (Era) by divine inspiration composed ninety-four books. Of these, twenty-four were restorations of the sacred literature of the <a href="08193a.htm">Israelites</a> which had perished in the Captivity; they were to be published openly, but the remaining were to be guarded in secret for the exclusive use of the wise (cf. <a href="../bible/dan012.htm#vrs4">Daniel 12:4, 9</a>, where the <a href="12477a.htm">prophet</a> is bidden to shut up and seal an inspired book until an appointed time). Accordingly it may be accepted as highly probable that in its original meaning an apocryphal writing had no unfavorable import, but simply denoted a composition which claimed a sacred origin, and was supposed to have been hidden for generations, either absolutely, awaiting the due time of its revelation, or relatively, inasmuch as <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it was confined to a limited esoteric circle. However, the name Apocrypha soon came to have an unfavourable signification which it still retains, comporting both want of genuineness and canonicity. These are the negative aspects of the modern application of the name; on its positive side it is properly employed only of a well defined class of literature, putting forth scriptural or quasi-scriptural pretensions, and which originated in part among the Hebrews during the two centuries preceding Christ and for a space after, and in part among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, both <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and heterodox, in the early centuries of our era.</p>

<h2 id="i">Apocrypha of Jewish origin</h2>

<p>Ancient literature, especially in the Orient, used methods much more free and elastic than those permitted by our modern and Occidental culture. Pseudographic composition was in vogue among the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the two centuries before <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> and for some time later. The attribution of a great name of the distant past to a book by its real author, who thus effaced his own <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>, was, in some cases at least, a mere literary fiction which deceived no one except the <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. This holds good for the so-called "Wisdom of Solomon", written in Greek and belonging to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> sacred canon. In other cases, where the assumed name did not stand as a symbol of a type of a certain kind of literature, the intention was not without a degree of at least objective literary dishonesty.</p>

<h3 id="I1">Jewish apocalypses</h3>

<p>The most important and valuable of the extant Jewish apocrypha are those which have a large apocalyptic element; that is, which profess to contain visions and revelations of the unseen world and the <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> future. Jewish apocalyptic literature is a theme which deserves and has increasingly received the attention of all interested in the development of the <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> thought of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that body of concepts and tendencies in which are fixed the roots of the great <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> principles of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> itself, just as its Divine Founder took His temporal generation from the stock of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. The Jewish apocalypses furnish the completing links in the progress of Jewish <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and fill what would otherwise be a gap, though a small one, between the advanced stage marked by the deuterocanonical books and its full maturity in the time of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>; a maturity so relatively perfect that <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> could suppose as existing in the popular consciousness, without teaching <em>de novo</em>, the doctrines of <a href="08549a.htm">future retribution</a>, the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>, and the existence, nature, and office of <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>. Jewish apocalyptic writing is an attempt to supply the place of <a href="12477a.htm">prophecy</a>, which had been dead for centuries, and it has its roots in the sacred oracles of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Hebrew prophecy on its human side had its springs, its occasions, and immediate objects in the present; the <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a> were inspired men who found matter for comfort as well as rebuke and warning in the actual conditions of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel's</a> theocratic life. But when ages had elapsed, and the glowing <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> promises of the <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a> had not been realized; when the Jewish people had chafed, not through two or three, but many generations, under the bitter yoke of foreign masters or the constantly repeated pressure of <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> states, reflecting and fervent spirits, finding no hope in the actual order of things, looked away from earth and fixed their vision on another and ideal world where <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> would reign unthwarted, to the everlasting glory of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a> both as a nation and in its faithful <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and unto the utter destruction and endless torment of the <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> oppressors and the unrighteous. Apocalyptic literature was both a message of comfort and an effort to solve the problems of the sufferings of the just and the apparent hopelessness of a fulfilment of the prophecies of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel's</a> sovereignty on earth. But the inevitable consequence of the apocalyptic distrust of everything present was its assumption of the guise of the remote and classic past; in other words, its pseudonymous character. Naturally basing itself upon the <a href="11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> and the Prophets, it clothed itself fictitiously with the authority of a patriarch or <a href="12477a.htm">prophet</a> who was made to reveal the transcendent future. But in their effort to adjust this future to the history that lay within their ken the apocalyptic writers unfolded also a philosophy of the origin and progress of mundane things. A wider view of world-politics and a comprehensive <a href="04413a.htm">cosmological</a> speculation are among the distinctive traits of Jewish apocalyptic. The Book of Daniel is the one book of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to which the non-inspired apocalypses bear the closest affinity, and it evidently furnished <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> to several of the latter. An apocalyptic element existing in the <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in Zacharias (i-vi), in Tobias (Tobias, xiii), can be traced back to the visions of Ezechiel which form the prototype of apocalyptic; all this had its influence upon the new literature. Messianism of course plays an important part in apocalyptic <a href="05528b.htm">eschatology</a> and the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> in certain books received a very high development. But even when it is transcendent and mystic it is intensely, almost fanatically, national, and surrounded by fanciful and often extravagant accessories. It lacks the universal outlook of some of the <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a>, especially the Deutero-Isaias, and is far from having a uniform and consistent physiognomy. Sometimes the <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> realm is placed upon the transfigured earth, centering in a new <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; in other works it is lifted into the Heavens; in some books the <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> is wanting or is apparently merely human, while the Parables of Henoch with their pre-existent <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> mark the highest point of development of the <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> concept to be found in the whole range of Hebrew literature.</p>



<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><em>(a) The Book of Henoch (Ethiopic)</em></p>

<p>See the <a href="01602a.htm">separate article</a> under this title.</p>

<p><em>(b) Assumption of Moses</em></p>

<p><a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, "De Principiis", III, ii, 1, names the Assumption of Moses &#151; <em>Analepsis Mouseos</em> &#151; as the book cited by the <a href="../bible/jud001.htm">Epistle of Jude, 9</a>, where there is an allusion to a dispute between Michael and <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a> over the body of Moses. Aside from a few other brief references in patristic literature, nothing more was known of this apocryphon until the Latin <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> containing a long portion of it was discovered by Ceriani in the <a href="01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a>, at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and published by him in 1861. Its identity with the ancient work is established by a quotation from the latter in the Acts of the Nicene Council. The book purports to be a series of predictions delivered in written form to the safe-keeping of <a href="08524a.htm">Josue (Joshua)</a> by Moses when the latter, in view of his approaching death, appointed Josue as his successor. The ostensible purpose of these deliverances is to confirm the <a href="10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> and the admonitions in Deuteronomy. The entire history of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a> is outlined. In a vehement and glowing style the book delineates under its prophetic guise the impiety of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel's</a> Hasmonean rulers and Sadducean <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. The historical allusions come down to the reign of an insolent monarch who is plainly <a href="07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a>, and a powerful ruler who shall come from the West and subjugate the people &#151; a reference to the punitive expedition of Quintilius Varus, 4 B.C. But the <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> will intervene and execute Divine wrath upon the enemies of the nation, and a cataclysm of nature, which is depicted with truly apocalyptic sublimity, will forerun the beginning of the new era. Strangely there is no mention of a <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection</a> or a judgment of <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a>. The book then returns to the doings of Moses and Josue. The <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> breaks off abruptly at chapter xii, and the portion cited by Jude must have belonged to the lost conclusion. This apocalypse has with solid reasons been assigned to the early years after <a href="07289c.htm">Herod's</a> death, between 4 B.C. and A.D. 10. It is evident that neither of <a href="07289c.htm#I">Herod's</a> sons, Philip and <a href="07289c.htm#III">Antipas</a>, had yet reigned thirty-four years, since the writer, hazarding a prediction that <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>, says that the sons should enjoy shorter reigns than their father. Thus the latest possible date of composition is fixed at A.D. 30. The author was a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>, and in all likelihood a Palestinian one. He belonged neither to the <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> of the type of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> epoch, nor to the <a href="13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, since he excoriates both alike. He must have been either a Zealot, that is an ultra-Nationalist and Messianist, or a fervid <a href="05546a.htm">Essene</a>. He wrote in Hebrew or Aramaic. The Latin text is translated from a Greek version.</p>

<p><em>(c) Book of the Secrets of Henoch (Slavonic Henoch)</em></p>

<p>In 1892 attention was called to Slavonic <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which on examination <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> to contain another Henoch book differing entirely from the <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> compilation. "The Book of the Secrets of Henoch" contains passages which satisfy allusions of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> to which there is nothing corresponding in the <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> Henoch. The same may be said about citations in the "Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs". Internal evidence shows that the new Henoch was composed by an Alexandrian <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> about the beginning of our Era, and in Greek. The work is sharply marked off from the older book by the absence of a <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> and the want of reference to a <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>. It mingles many bizarre details concerning the celestial realm, the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, and stars, with advanced <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> on man's destiny, moral excellence, and the punishment of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. The patriarch is taken up through the seven heavens to the very throne of the Eternal. Some of the details throw interesting light on various obscure allusions in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, such as the superimposed heavens, the presence of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> powers "in heavenly places", Ezechiel's strange creatures full of eyes.</p>

<p><em>(d) Fourth Book of Esdras</em></p>

<p>The personage serving as the screen of the real author of this book is Esdras (Ezra), the priest-scribe and leader among the <a href="08193a.htm">Israelites</a> who returned from <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, to Jerusalem. The fact that two canonical books are associated with his name, together with a genuine literary power, a profoundly religious spirit pervading Fourth Esdras, and some <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> points of contact with the Gospels combined to win for it an acceptance among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> unequalled by any other apocryphon. Both Greek and <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> cite it as prophetical, while some, as <a href="01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, were ardent admirers of it. <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a> alone is positively unfavourable. Notwithstanding this widespread reverence for it in early times, it is a remarkable fact that the book never got a foothold in the canon or liturgy of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nevertheless, all through the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it maintained an intermediate position between canonical and merely human compositions, and even after the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, together with Third Esdras, was placed in the appendix to the official edition of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. Besides the original Greek text, which has not survived, the book has appeared in Latin, Syriac, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a>, and Arabic versions. The first and last two chapters of the Latin translation do not exist in the Oriental ones and have been added by a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> hand. And yet there need be no hesitation in relegating the Fourth Book of Esdras to the ranks of the apocrypha. Not to insist on the allusion to the Book of Daniel in xii, 11, the date given in the first version (iii, 1) is <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, and the whole tenor and character of the work places it in the age of apocalyptic literature. The dominant critical dating assigns it to a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> writing in the reign of <a href="05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, A.D. 81-96. Certainly it was composed some time before A.D. 218, since it is expressly quoted by <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>. The original text, iii-xiv, is of one piece and the work of a single author. The motive of the book is the problem lying heavily upon Jewish patriots after the destruction of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by Titus. The outlook was most dark and the national life seemed utterly extinguished. In consequence, a sad and anxious spirit pervades the work, and the writer, using the guise of Esdras lamenting over the ruin of the first city and temple, insistently seeks to penetrate the reasons of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> apparent abandonment of His people and the non-fulfilment of His promises. The author would learn the future of his nation. His interest is centered in the latter; the universalism of the book is attenuated. The apocalypse is composed of seven visions. The Messianism of Fourth Esdras suffers from the discouragement of the era and is influenced by the changed conditions produced by the advent of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Its <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> is mortal, and his reign merely one of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> upon earth. Likewise the <a href="05528b.htm">eschatology</a> labours with two conflicting elements: the <a href="12677d.htm">redemption</a> of all <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the small number of the <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a>. All <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a> with Adam. The Fourth Book of Esdras is sometimes called by non-Catholics Second Esdras, as they apply the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> form, Ezra, to the canonical books.</p>

<p><em>(e) Apocalypse of Baruch</em></p>

<p>For a long time a Latin fragment, chapters lxxviii-lxxxvii, of this pseudograph had been known. In 1866 a complete Syriac text was discovered by Monsignor Ceriani, whose researches in the <a href="01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> have so enriched the field of ancient literature. The Syriac is a translation from the Greek; the original was written in Hebrew. There is a close relation between this apocalypse and that of Fourth Esdras, but critics are divided over the question, which has influenced the other. The probabilities favour the hypothesis that the Baruch apocryphon is an imitation of that of Esdras and therefore later. The approximate dates assigned to it range between A.D. 50 and 117. The "Apocalypse of Baruch" is a somewhat artificial production, without the originality and force of Fourth Esdras. It deals in part with the same problems, viz., the sufferings of the theocratic people, and their ultimate triumph over their oppressors. When certain passages are freed from evident <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> interpolations, its Messianism in general is earthly, but in the latter part of the book the <a href="10212c.htm">Messias's</a> realm tends unmistakably towards a more spiritual conception. As in Fourth Esdras, <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is traced to the disobedience of Adam. Greater importance is attached to the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> than in the related composition, and the points of contact with the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are more striking. The author was a <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, but one who, while adopting a distinctly Jewish view, was probably acquainted with the <a href="14530a.htm">Christian Scriptures</a> and freely laid them under contribution. Some recent students of the "Apocalypse of Baruch" have seen in it a composite work, but the majority of critics hold with better reason to its unity. The book is lengthy. It speaks in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of Baruch, the secretary of Jeremias. It opens with a palpable <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a>. Baruch announces the doom of the city and temple of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> of the <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> epoch. However, not the Chaldeans, but <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, will bring about the destruction. Another and pre-existent Holy City is reserved by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, since the world cannot exist without a <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The artificiality and tediousness of the apocalypse are redeemed by a singular breadth of view and elevation of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, with the limitation noted.</p>

<p><em>(f) The Apocalypse of Abraham</em></p>

<p>The Apocalypse of Abraham has recently been translated from Slavonic into German. It relates the circumstances of <a href="01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> conversions and the visions thereupon accorded him. His guide in the a celestial realms is Jael, an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> distinct from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, but possessing divine powers in certain regards. The work has affinities with Fourth Esdras and the "Apocalypse of Baruch". The origin of <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> is explained by man's <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>. The Elect, or <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a>, will gather the dispersed tribes, but <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> alone will punish the enemies of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Particularism and the transcendence of the last cosmic stage are the notes of this apocalypse. Its data, however, are so vague that it is impossible to fix the time of its composition.</p>

<p><em>(g) The Apocalypse of Daniel</em></p>

<p>The Apocalypse of Daniel is the work of a <a href="11712a.htm">Persian</a> <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> of the twelfth century, and is unique in foretelling two <a href="10212c.htm">Messiases</a>: one, the son of Joseph (<a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>), whose career ends in his failure and death; the other the son of <a href="04642b.htm">David</a>, who will liberate <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a> and reign on earth gloriously.</p>

<h3 id="I2">Legendary apocrypha of Jewish origin</h3>

<p><em>(a) Book of Jubilees or Little Genesis</em></p>

<p>Epiphanius, <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, and others quote a work under the title "The Jubilees" or "The Little Genesis". <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> testifies that the original was in Hebrew. It is cited by Byzantine authors down to the twelfth century. After that we hear no more of it until it was found in an <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the last century. A considerable Latin fragment has also been recovered. The Book of the Jubilees is the narrative of Genesis amplified and embellished by a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> of the <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> period. It professes to be a revelation given to Moses by the "Angel of the Face". There is a very systematic <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a> according to the years, weeks of years, and jubilees. A patriarchal origin is ascribed to the great Jewish feasts. The <a href="01476d.htm">angelology</a> is highly developed, but the writer disbelieved in the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>. The observance of the Law is insisted on. It is hard to fix either the date or the religious circle in which the work arose. <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the Temple still stood, and the Book of Henoch is quoted. As for the lowest date, the book is employed by the Jewish portion of the "Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs". Estimates vary between 135 B.C. and A.D. 60. Among the lost Jewish apocrypha, the one worthy of special notice here is;</p>

<p><em>(b) The Book of Jannes and Mambres</em></p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a> applies these names to the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> magicians who reproduced some of the wonders wrought by Moses. The names are not found in the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> remarks that <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> does not quote "from public writings but from a sacred book which is called Jannes and Mambres". The names were known to Pliny, and figure in the Talmudic traditions. Recently R. James in the "Journal of Theological Studies", 1901, II, 572-577, claims to have found a fragment of this lost apocryphon in Latin and Old English versions.</p>

<p><em>(c) Third Book of Esdras</em></p>

<p>This is also styled by non-Catholics the First Book of Esdras, since they give to the first canonical Esdrine writing the <a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> form Ezra. Third Esdras is one of the three uncanonical books appended to the official edition of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. It exists in two of the oldest <a href="04080b.htm">codices</a> of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, viz., <a href="04086a.htm">Vaticanus</a> and <a href="04080c.htm">Alexandrinus</a>, where it precedes the canonical Esdras. The same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Old Latin and other versions. Third Esdras enjoyed exceptional favour in the early ages of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, being quoted as Scripture with implicit <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> by the leading Greek and <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> (See <a href="04378a.htm">Cornely</a>, Introductio Generalis, I, 201). <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, however, the great minimizer of sacred literature, rejected it as apocryphal, and thenceforward its standing was impaired. The book in fact is made up for the most part of materials taken from the inspired books of Paralipomenon, Esdras, and Nehemias, put together, however, in great chronological confusion. We must suppose that it was subsequent to the above Scriptures, since it was evidently composed in Greek and by an Alexandrian <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>. The only original part of the work is chapters iii-v, 6. This recounts a contest between three young Hebrews of the bodyguard of King Darius, each striving to formulate the wisest saying. The victory is awarded to Zorobabel (Zerubbabel), who defends Truth as the strongest force, and the audience shouts: "Great is Truth and powerful above all things!" (<em>Magna est veritas et proevalebit.</em>) The date of composition is not ascertainable except within very wide limits. These are on one side c. 300 B.C., the latest time assigned to <a href="11472a.htm">Paralipomenon</a>-<a href="05535a.htm">Esdras</a>-<a href="10737c.htm">Nehemias</a>, and on the other, c. A.D. 100, the era of <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, who employed Third Esdras. There is greater likelihood that the composition took place before our Era.</p>

<p><em>(d) Third Book of Machabees</em></p>

<p>Third Book of Machabees is the title given to a short narrative which is found in the Alexandrine codex of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint version</a> and various private <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. It gives an account of an attempted <a href="04748c.htm">desecration</a> of the Temple at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> king, Ptolemy IV (Philopator) after his victory over Antiochus the Great at Raphia, 217 B.C., and the <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> frustration of his endeavour to wreak vengeance upon the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> through a massacre with elephants. This apocryphon abounds in absurdities and <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> impossibilities, and is a very weak piece of fiction written in Greek by an Alexandrian <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a>, and probably designed to encourage its countrymen in the midst of persecutions. It rests on no ascertainable historical fact, but apparently is an extravagant and varying version of the occurrence related by <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, "Against Apion", 1I, 5. The date cannot be determined. Since the book shows acquaintance with the Greek additions to Daniel, it cannot be earlier than the first century B.C., and could scarcely have found such favour among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> if composed later than the first century after Christ. The Syrian Church was the first to give it a friendly reception, presumably on the strength of its mention in the Apostolic Constitutions. Later, Third Machabees was admitted into the canon of the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, but seems never to have been known to the Latins.</p>

<h3 id="I3">Apocryphal psalms and prayers</h3>

<p><em>(a) Psalms of Solomon</em></p>

<p>This is a collection of eighteen psalms composed in Hebrew, and, as is commonly agreed, by a <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> of Palestine, about the time of Pompey's capture of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, 63 B.C. The collection makes no pretensions to authorship by Solomon, and therefore is not, strictly speaking, apocryphal. The name of the wise king became associated with it later and doubtless was the means of preserving it. The spirit of these psalms is one of great moral earnestness and righteousness, but it is the righteousness of the <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, consisting in the observance of the legal traditions and ceremonial law. The Hasmonean dynasty and the <a href="13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> are denounced. A <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> deliverer is looked for, but he is to be merely human. He will reign by <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>, and not by the sword. Free will and the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection</a> are taught. The Psalms of Solomon are of value in illustrating the religious views and attitudes of the <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> in the age of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. The <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> contain at the end of the canonical <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a> a short psalm (cli), which, however, is "outside the number", i.e. of the Psalms. Its title reads: "This psalm was written by <a href="04642b.htm">David</a> himself in addition to the number, when he had fought with Goliath." It is based on various passages in the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and there is no evidence that it was ever written in Hebrew.</p>

<p><em>(b) Prayer of Manasses (Manasseh)</em></p>

<p>A beautiful Penitential <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> put in the mouth of Manasses, King of Juda, who carried <a href="07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> abominations so far. The composition is based on II Paralipomenon, xxxiii, 11-13, which states that Manasses was carried captive to Babylon and there repented; while the same source (18) refers to his <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> as recorded in certain chronicles which are lost. Learned opinion differs as to whether the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> which has come down to us was written in Hebrew or Greek. Several ancient <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> contain it as an appendix to the <a href="12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. It is also incorporated in the ancient so-called Apostolic Constitutions. In editions of the <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> antedating the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> it was placed after the books of Paralipomenon. The Clementine <a href="15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> relegated it to the appendix, where it is still to be found in reprints of the standard text. The <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> breathes a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit, and it is not entirely certain that it is really of Jewish origin.</p>

<h3 id="I4">Jewish philosophy</h3>

<p><em>(a) Fourth Book of Machabees</em></p>

<p>This is a short <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatise on the supremacy of <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> reason, that is reason regulated by <a href="09071a.htm">divine law</a>, which for the author is the <a href="10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>. In setting up reason as the master of human passion, the author was distinctly influenced by <a href="14299a.htm">Stoic</a> philosophy. From it also he derived his four cardinal virtues: <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a>, righteousness (or <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>), <a href="06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, temperance; <em>phronesis, dikaiosyne, andreia, sophrosyne</em>, and it was through Fourth Machabees that this category was appropriated by early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> ascetical writers. The second part of the book exhibits the sufferings of Eleazar and the seven <a href="09493b.htm">Machabean</a> brothers as examples of the dominion of <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> reason. The aim of the Hellenistic Jewish author was to inculcate devotion to the Law. He is unknown. The work was <a href="05525a.htm">erroneously</a> ascribed to <a href="08522a.htm">Josephus</a> by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and others. It appears to have been produced before the fall of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but its date is a matter of conjecture.</p>

<h2 id="ii">Apocrypha of Jewish origin with Christian accretions</h2>

<p><em>(a) Sibylline Oracles</em></p>

<p>See the separate article under this title.</p>

<p><em>(b) Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs.</em> This is an extensive pseudograph, consisting of;</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>narrations in which each of the twelve sons of Jacob relates his life, embellished by Midrashic expansions of the Biblical data</li><li>exhortations by each patriarch to the practice of virtues, or the shunning of vices illustrated in his life</li><li>apocalyptic portions concerning the future of the twelve tribes, and the <a href="10212c.htm">Messianic</a> times</li></ol></div>

<p>The body of the work is undoubtedly Judaic, but there are many interpolations of an unmistakably <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> origin, presenting in their ensemble a fairly full <a href="14597a.htm">Christology</a>, but one suspected of <a href="05070c.htm">Docetism</a>. Recent students of the Testaments assign with much probability the Jewish groundwork to the Hasmonean period, within the limits 135-63 B.C. Portions which extol the tribes of Levi and Juda are interpreted as an apology for the Hasmonean pontiff-kings. The remaining ten tribes are supposed to be yet in existence, and are urged to be faithful to the representatives of the <a href="12406a.htm">priestly</a> and royal power. In this defence of the <a href="09493b.htm">Machabean</a> dynasty, and by a writer with <a href="11789b.htm">Pharisaic</a> tendencies, probably a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Testaments are unique in Jewish literature. True, there are passages in which the <a href="12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> caste and the ruling tribes are unsparingly denounced, but these are evidently later insertions. The <a href="05528b.htm">eschatology</a> is rather advanced. The <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> is to spring from the tribe of Levi (elsewhere, however, from Juda); he is to be the eternal <a href="12407b.htm">High-Priest</a> &#151; a unique feature of the book &#151; as well as the civil ruler of the nation. During his reign <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> will gradually cease. The gates of <a href="14519a.htm">paradise</a> are to be opened and the <a href="08193a.htm">Israelites</a> and converted <a href="06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> will dwell there and eat of the tree of life. The <a href="08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a> is therefore to be an eternal one on earth, therein agreeing with the <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> Henoch. The Testaments exist complete in Greek, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, Latin, and Slavonic versions. Aramaic and Syriac fragments are preserved.</p>

<p><em>(c) The Ascension of Isaias</em></p>

<p>The Ascension of Isaias consists of two parts:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>The Martyrdom of Isaias, in which it is told that the prophet was sawn in two by the order of the wicked King Manasses.</li><li>The Ascension proper. </li></ol></div>

<p>This purports to be the description by Isaias of a vision in which he was rapt up through the seven heavens to the presence of the Trinity, and beheld the descent of the Son, "the Beloved", on His mission of <a href="12677d.htm">redemption</a>. He changes his form in passing through the inferior celestial circles. The <a href="12477a.htm">prophet</a> then sees the glorified Beloved reascending. The Martyrdom is a Jewish work, saving some rather large interpolations. The rest is by <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> hands or perhaps a single writer, who united his apocalypse with the Martyrdom. There are tokens that the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> element is a product of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, and that our work is the same with that much in favour among several <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> under the name of the "Anabaticon", or "Ascension of Isaias". The Jewish portion is thought to have appeared in the first century of our era; the remainder, in the middle of the second. <a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, and <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> seem to have been acquainted with the Martyrdom; Sts. Jerome and Epiphanius are the earliest witnesses for the Ascension proper. The apocryphon exists in Greek, <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a>, and Slavonic <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.</p>

<p><em>(d) Minor Jewish-Christian Apocrypha</em></p>

<p>Space will permit only an enumeration of unimportant specimens of apocryphal literature, extant in whole or part, and consisting of</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>Jewish originals recast or freely interpolated by <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>, viz., the "Apocalypses of Elias" (Elijah), "Sophonias" (Zephaniah), the "Paralipomenon of Baruch"; and</li><li><a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> compositions whose material was supplied by Jewish sources; the so-called "Apocalypse of Moses", the "Apocalypse of Esdras", the "Testament of Abraham", the "Testament of the Three Patriarchs", the "Prayer of Joseph", the "Prayer of Aseneth", the "Marriage of Aseneth", (the wife of Joseph)</li></ul></div>

<p>Probably with this second class are to be included the "Testaments of Job" and "Zacharias", the "Adam Books", the "Book of Creation", the "Story of Aphikia" (the wife of Jesus Sirach). These works as a rule appeared in the East, and in many cases show <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> tendencies. Further information about some of them will be found at the end of articles on the above personages.</p>

<h2 id="iii">Apocrypha of Christian origin</h2>

<p>The term <em>Christian</em> here is used in a comprehensive sense and embraces works produced both by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>; the latter are chiefly members of the various branches or <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, which flourished in the second and third centuries. The <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> apocryphal writings in general imitate the books of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and therefore, with a few exceptions, fall under the description of Gospels, Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypses.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h3 id="III1">Apocryphal gospels</h3>

<p>The term <em>apocryphal</em> in connection with special Gospels must be understood as bearing no more unfavourable an import than "uncanonical". This applies to the Gospel of the Hebrews and in a less degree to that of the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, which in the main seem to have been either embodiments of primitive tradition, or a mere recasting of <a href="03274a.htm">canonical</a> <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a> with a few variations and amplifications. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, all the extant specimens of the apocryphal Gospels take the inspired evangelical documents as their starting-point. But the genuine Gospels are silent about long stretches of the life of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and <a href="08504a.htm">St. Joseph</a>. Frequently they give but a tantalizing glimpse of some episode on which we would fain be more fully informed. This reserve of the <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> did not satisfy the pardonable curiosity of many <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> eager for details, and the severe and dignified simplicity of their narrative left unappeased <a href="07672a.htm">imaginations</a> seeking the sensational and the marvellous. When, therefore, enterprising spirits responded to this natural craving by pretended Gospels full of romantic fables and fantastic and striking details, their fabrications were eagerly read and largely accepted as <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> by common folk who were devoid of any critical faculty and who were predisposed to <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> what so luxuriously fed their <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> curiosity. Both <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> were concerned in writing these fictions. The former had no other motive than that of a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a>, being sometimes moved by a real though misguided <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, as witness the author of the Pseudo-Matthew: <em>Amor Christi est cui satisfecimus.</em> But the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> apocryphists, while gratifying curiosity, composed spurious Gospels in order to trace backward their <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and peculiarities to <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Fathers were hostile even towards the narratives of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> authorship. It was not until the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, when their <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> origin was forgotten even by most of the learned, that these apocryphal stories began to enter largely into sacred legends, such as the "Aurea Sacra", into <a href="10348a.htm">miracle plays</a>, <a href="03710a.htm">Christian art</a>, and poetry. A comparison of the least extravagant of these productions with the real Gospels reveals the chasm separating them. Though worthless historically, the apocryphal Gospels help us to better understand the religious conditions of the second and third centuries, and they are also of no little value as early witnesses of the canonicity of the writings of the four <a href="05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>. The quasi-evangelistic compositions concerning Christ which make no pretensions to be Gospels will be treated elsewhere. They are all of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> origin. (See <a href="01225c.htm">AGRAPHA</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="A">Apocryphal gospels of Catholic origin</h3>

<p><em>The Protoevangelium Jacobi, or Infancy Gospel of James</em></p>

<p>It purports to have been written by "James the brother of the Lord", i.e. the Apostle James the Less. It is based on the <a href="03274a.htm">canonical</a> <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a> which it expands with legendary and <a href="07672a.htm">imaginative</a> elements, which are sometimes puerile or fantastic. The birth, <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, and marriage of the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> are described in the first eleven chapters and these are the source of various traditions current among the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. They are of value in indicating the veneration paid to Mary at a very early age. For instance it is the "Protoevangelium" which first tells that Mary was the <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> offspring of Joachim and Anna, previously childless; that when three years old the child was taken to the Temple and dedicated to its service, in fulfilment of her <a href="11478c.htm">parents'</a> <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a>. When Mary was twelve Joseph is chosen by the <a href="12407b.htm">high-priest</a> as her spouse in obedience to a <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> sign &#151; a dove coming out of his rod and resting on his head. The nativity is embellished in an unrestrained manner. Critics find that the "Protoevangelium" is a composite into which two or three documents enter. It was known to <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> under the name of the "Book of James". There are signs in <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin's</a> works that he was acquainted with it, or at least with a parallel tradition. The work, therefore, has been ascribed to the second century. Portions of it show a familiarity with Jewish customs, and critics have surmised that the groundwork was composed by a Jewish-Christian. The "Protoevangelium" exists in ancient Greek and Syriac recensions. There are also <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> and Latin translations.</p>

<p><em>Gospel of St. Matthew</em></p>

<p>This is a Latin composition of the fourth or fifth century. It pretends to have been written by <a href="10056b.htm">St. Matthew</a> and translated by <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. Pseudo-Matthew is in large part parallel to the "Protoevangelium Jacobi", being based on the latter or its sources. It differs in some particulars always in the direction of the more marvellous. Some of its data have replaced in popular <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> parallel ones of the older pseudograph. Such is the age of fourteen in which Mary was <a href="02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to Joseph. A narrative of the flight into <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> is adorned with poetic wonders. The dragons, lions, and other wild beasts of the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> adore the infant <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. At His word the palm-trees bow their heads that the Holy Family may pluck their fruit. The idols of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> are shattered when the Divine Child enters the land. The "Gospel of the Nativity of Mary" is a recast of the Pseudo-Matthew, but reaches only to the birth of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. It is extant in a Latin <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the tenth century.</p>

<p><em>Arabic Gospel of the Infancy</em></p>

<p>The Arabic is a translation of a lost Syriac original. The work is a compilation and refers expressly to the "Book of Joseph Caiphas, the High-Priest", the "Gospel of the Infancy", and the "Perfect Gospel". Some of its stories are derived from the Thomas Gospel, and others from a recension of the apocryphal Matthew. However there are <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>, said to have occurred in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, not found related in any other Gospel, spurious or genuine, among them the healings of <a href="09182a.htm">leprosy</a> through the water in which <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had been washed, and the cures effected through the garments He had worn. These have become familiar in <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> legend. So also has the episode of the robbers Titus and Dumachus, into whose hands the Holy Family fell. Titus bribes Dumachus not to molest them; the Infant foretells that thirty years thence the thieves will be crucified with Him, Titus on His right and Dumachus on His left and that the former will accompany Him into <a href="14519a.htm">paradise</a>. The apocryphon abounds in allusions to characters in the real Gospels. Lipsius opines that the work as we have it is a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> retouching of a <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> compilation. It is impossible to ascertain its date, but it was probably composed before the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> era. It is very popular with the Syrian <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. An originally Arabic "History of Joseph the Carpenter" is published in Tischendorf's collection of apocrypha. It describes <a href="08504a.htm">St. Joseph's</a> death, related by <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> to His disciples. It is a tasteless and bombastic effort, and seems to date from about the fourth century.</p>

<p><em>Gospel of Gamaliel</em></p>

<p>Dr. A. Baumstark in the <em>Revue Biblique</em> (April, 1906, 253 sqq.), has given this name to a collection of Coptic fragments of a homogeneous character, which were supposed by another Coptic scholar, Reveillout, to form a portion of the "Gospel of the Twelve Apostles" (q.v. <em>inf.</em>). These fragments have been referred to a single Gospel also by Lacau, in "Fragments d'apocryphes coptes de la biblioth&egrave;que nationale" (Cairo, 1904). The narrative is in close dependence on <a href="08438a.htm">St. John's Gospel</a>. The author did not pose seriously as an evangelist, since he explicitly quotes from the <a href="08438a.htm">fourth canonical Gospel</a>. He places the relation in the mouth of <a href="06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> of <a href="../bible/act005.htm">Acts 5:34</a>. Baumstark assigns it to the fifth century. The writer was evidently influenced by the <a href="01111b.htm">"Acta Pilati"</a>.</p>

<p><em>The Transitus Mari&aelig; or Evangelium Joannis</em></p>

<p>The Transitus Mari&aelig; or Evangelium Joannis, which is written in the name of <a href="08492a.htm">St. John the Apostle</a>, and describes the death of Mary, enjoyed a wide popularity, as is attested by the various recensions in different languages which exist. The Greek has the superscription: "The Account of St. John the Theologian of the Falling Asleep of the Holy Mother of God". One of the Latin versions is prefaced by a spurious letter of Melito, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sardis, explaining that the object of the work was to counteract a <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> composition of the same title and subject. There is a basis of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> in this statement as our apocryphon betrays tokens of being a <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> writing worked over in an <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> interest. A "Transitus Mari&aelig;" is numbered among the apocrypha by the official list of the "Decretum of Gelasius" of the fifth or sixth century. It is problematic, however, whether this is to be identified with our recast Transitus or not. Critics assign the latter to the end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century. The relation of the Transitus to the tradition of Mary's Assumption has not yet been adequately examined. However, there is warrant for saying that while the tradition existed substantially in portions of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at an early period, and thus prepared the way for the acceptance of mythical amplifications, still its later form and details were considerably influenced by the Transitus and kindred writings. Certainly the <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> of <a href="08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, "In Dormitionem Mari&aelig;", reveal evidence of this influence, e.g. the second <a href="07448a.htm">homily</a>, xii, xiii, xiv. Going further back, the "Encomium" of Modestus, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, in the seventh century (P.G., LXXXVI, 3311), and the <a href="05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> of the fifth (De divinis nominibus, iii), probably suppose an acquaintance with apocryphal narratives of the <a href="02006b.htm">Death and Assumption</a> of the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. These narratives have a common groundwork, though varying considerably in minor circumstances. The Apostles are preternaturally transported from different quarters of the globe to the Virgin's deathbed, those who had died being resuscitated for the purpose. The "Departure" takes place at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, though the Greek version places Mary first at Bethlehem. A <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> who ventures to touch the sacred body instantly loses both hands, which are restored through the mediation of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Christ accompanied by a train of <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> comes down to receive His mother's <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. The Apostles bear the body to Gethsemani and deposit it in a <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a>, whence it is taken up alive to <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. (See <a href="02006b.htm">ASSUMPTION</a>; <a href="15464b.htm">MARY</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="B">Judaistic and heretical gospels</h3>

<p><em>Gospel according to the Hebrews</em></p>

<p><a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, and <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> speak of a "Gospel according to the Hebrews" which was the sole one in use among the Palestinian <a href="08399a.htm">Judeo</a>-Christians, otherwise known as the Nazarenes. Jerome translated it from the Aramaic into Greek. It was evidently very ancient, and several of the above mentioned writers associate it with St. Matthew's Gospel, which it seems to have replaced in the <a href="08399a.htm">Jewish</a>-<a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>. The relation between the Gospel according to the Hebrews and our canonical Matthew Gospel is a matter of controversy. The surviving fragments prove that there were close literal resemblances. Harnack asserts that the Hebrew Gospel was entirely independent, the tradition it contained being parallel to that of Matthew. Zahn, while excluding any dependence on our Greek canonical Matthew, maintains one on the primitive Matthew, according to which its general contents were derived from the latter. This Gospel seems to have been read as canonical in some non-Palestinian churches; the Fathers who are acquainted with it refer to it with a certain amount of respect. Twenty-four fragments have been preserved by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers. These indicate that it had a number of sections in common with the <a href="14389b.htm">Synoptics</a>, but also various narratives and sayings of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, not found in the <a href="03274a.htm">canonical</a> <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. The surviving specimens lack the simplicity and dignity of the inspired writings; some even savour of the grotesque. We are warranted in saying that while this extra-canonical material probably has as its starting-point primitive tradition, it has been disfigured in the interests of a Judaizing Church. (See <a href="01225c.htm">AGRAPHA</a>.)</p>

<p><em>Gospel According to the Egyptians</em></p>

<p>It is by this title that <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, and Epiphanius describe an uncanonical work, which evidently was circulated in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. All agree that it was employed by <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> &#151; for the most part <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>. The scanty citations which have been preserved in the Fathers indicate a tendency towards the <a href="05412c.htm">Encratite</a> condemnation of marriage, and a <a href="11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. The Gospel according to the Egyptians did not replace the canonical records in the Alexandrian Church, as Harnack would have us believe, but it seems to have enjoyed a certain popularity in the country districts among the Coptic natives. It could scarcely have been composed later than the middle of the second century and it is not at all impossible that it retouched some primitive material not represented in the <a href="03274a.htm">canonical</a> <a href="06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.</p>

<p><em>Gospel of St. Peter</em></p>

<p>The existence of an apocryphal composition bearing this name in <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity had long been known by references to it in certain early patristic writers who intimate that it originated or was current among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="05070c.htm">Docetic</a> views. Much additional light has been thrown on this document by the discovery of a long fragment of it at Akhm&icirc;n in Upper <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in the winter of 1886-87, by the French Arch&aelig;ological Mission. It is in Greek and written on a parchment codex at a date somewhere between the sixth and ninth century. The fragment narrates part of the Passion, the Burial, and <a href="12792a.htm">Resurrection</a>. It betrays a dependence, in some instances literal, on the four inspired Gospels, and is therefore a valuable additional testimony to their early acceptance. While the apocryphon has many points of contact with the genuine Gospels, it diverges curiously from them in details, and bears evidence of having treated them with much freedom. No marked <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> notes are found in the recovered fragment, but there are passages which are easily susceptible of a heterodox meaning. One of the few extra-canonical passages which may contain an authentic tradition is that which describes <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> as placed in mockery upon a throne by His tormentors. Pseudo-Peter is intermediate in character between the genuine Evangels and the purely legendary apocrypha. Its composition must be assigned to the first quarter or the middle of the second century of the Christian era. C. Schmidt thinks he has found traces of what is perhaps a second Gospel of Peter in some ancient papyri (Schmidt, Sitzungsberichte der k&ouml;niglichen preuss. Akademie zu Berlin, 1895; cf. Bardenhewer, Geschichte, I, 397, 399).</p>

<p><em>Gospel of St. Philip</em></p>

<p>Only one or two quotations remain of the Gospel of St. Philip mentioned by Epiphanius and <a href="09179b.htm">Leontius of Byzantium</a>; but these are enough to <a href="12454c.htm">prove</a> its <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> colouring.</p>

<p><em>Gospel of St. Thomas</em></p>

<p>There are two Greek and two Latin redactions of it, differing much from one another. A Syriac translation is also found. A Gospel of Thomas was known to many Fathers. The earliest to mention it is <a href="07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a> (155-235), who informs us that it was in use among the Naasenes, a <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of Syrian <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, and cites a sentence which does not appear in our extant text. <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> relegates it to the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> writings. <a href="04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> says it was employed by the <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>; <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> rejects it as <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> and spurious. It is clear that the original Pseudo-Thomas was of heterodox origin, and that it dates from the second century; the citations of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> establish that it was palpably <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> in tenor. But in the extant Thomas Gospel there is no formal or manifest <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. The prototype was evidently expurgated by a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> hand, who, however, did not succeed in eradicating all traces of its original taint. The apocryphon in all its present forms extravagantly magnifies the Divine aspect of the boy <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. In bold contrast to the Infancy narrative of <a href="09420a.htm">St. Luke</a>, where the Divinity is almost effaced, the author makes the Child a miracle-worker and <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> prodigy, and in harmony with <a href="05070c.htm">Docetism</a>, leaves scarcely more than the appearance of humanity in Him. This pseudo-Gospel is unique among the apocrypha, inasmuch as it describes a part of the hidden life of <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> between the ages of five and twelve. But there is much that is fantastic and offensive in the pictures of the exploits of the boy <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. His youthful <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> are worked at times out of mere childish fancy, as when He formed clay pigeons, and at a clap of His hands they flew away as living birds; sometimes, from beneficence; but again from a kind of harsh retribution.</p>

<p><em>Gospel of St. Bartholomew</em></p>

<p>The so-called Decretum of Gelasius classes the Gospel of <a href="02313c.htm">St. Bartholomew</a> among the apocrypha. The earliest allusion to it is in <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> works. Recently scholars have brought to light fragments of it in old <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. One of these <a href="11302c.htm">Orientalists</a>, Baumstark, would place its composition in the first part of the fourth century. A <em>Gospel of Matthias</em> is mentioned by <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> and <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> among the <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> literature along with the Peter and Thomas Gospels. <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> states that the <a href="02326a.htm">Basilidean Gnostics</a> appealed to a "secret discourse" communicated to them by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostle</a> Matthias who had received instruction privately from the Lord. <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, who was credulous concerning apocryphal literature, quotes with respect several times the "Tradition of Matthias".</p>

<p><em>Gospel of the Twelve Apostles</em></p>

<p>A Gospel of the <a href="01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a> was known to <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (third century). Other patristic notices give rise to some uncertainty whether the Gospel of the <a href="01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a> of antiquity was really distinct from that of the Hebrews. The greater probabilities oppose their identity. Recently the claim has been made by M. Reveillout, a Coptic scholar, that the lost Gospel has been in a considerable measure recovered in several Coptic fragments, all of which, he asserts, belong to the same document. But this position has been successfully combated by Dr. Baumstark in the in the "Revue Biblique" (April, 1906, 245 sqq.), who will allow at most a probability that certain brief sections appertain to a Gospel of the <a href="01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>, written originally in Greek and current among <a href="05242c.htm">Gnostic Ebionites</a> as early as the second century. There exists a late and entirely <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Syriac "Gospel of the Twelve Apostles", published by J. Rendel Harris (Cambridge, 1900).</p>

<p><em>Other Gospels</em></p>

<p>It is enough to note the existence of other pseudo-Gospels, of which very little is known beside the names. There was a <em>Gospel of St. Andrew</em>, probably identical with the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> "Acts of Andrew" (q.v., inf.); a <em>Gospel of Barnabas,</em> a <em>Gospel of Thaddeus,</em> a <em>Gospel of Eve,</em> and even one of <a href="08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, the last in use among the <a href="03143a.htm">Gnostic sect of Cainites</a>, and which glorified the traitor.</p>

<h3 id="III2">Pilate literature and other apocrypha concerning Christ</h3>

<p>While <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was struggling against the forces of Roman <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>, there was a natural tendency to dwell upon the part which a representative of the Roman Empire played in the supreme events of <a href="08377a.htm">Our Lord's life</a>, and to shape the testimony of <a href="12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, the <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="08544a.htm">Judea</a>, even at the cost of exaggeration and amplification, into a weapon of apologetic defence, making that official bear witness to the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>, Crucifixion, and <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>. Hence arose a considerable apocryphal Pilate literature, of which the Gospel of Gamaliel really forms a part, and like this latter apocryphon, it is characterized by exaggerating <a href="12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> weak defence of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> into strong sympathy and practical <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in His divinity.</p>

<p><em>Report of Pilate to the Emperor.</em></p>

<p>In the apocryphal Acts of Peter and Paul there is embodied a letter purporting to have been sent by <a href="12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> to the Emperor Claudius. This briefly relates the fatuous crime of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> in persecuting the Holy One promised to them by their <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; enumerates His <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> and states that the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> accused <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> of being a magician. <a href="12083c.htm">Pilate</a> at the time <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> this, delivered Him to them. After the <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> the soldiers whom the governor had placed at the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> were bribed by the leaders to be silent, but nevertheless divulged the fact. The missive concludes with a warning against the mendacity of the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. This composition is clearly apocryphal though unexpectedly brief and restrained. It is natural, to attempt to trace a resemblance between this pseudograph and certain references of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers to Acta or Gesta of <a href="12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (Apologia, xxi) after giving a sketch of the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> and Passion of Christ, subjoins: "All these things <a href="12083c.htm">Pilate</a> . . . announced to <a href="14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>." A comparison between this pericope and the Pseudo-Pilate report reveals a literary dependence between them, though the critics differ as to the priority of these documents. In chapters 35, 38, and 48 of <a href="08580c.htm">Justin's</a> <em>Apologia</em>, that Father appeals confidently as a <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> and Passion of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to "Acts" or records of <a href="12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> existing in the imperial archives. While it is possible that St. Justin may have heard of such a report, and even probable that the <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> transmitted some account of the events at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it is on the other hand admissible that <a href="08580c.htm">Justin's</a> assertion was based on nothing more than hypothesis. This is the opinion of the majority of the experts. During the persecutions under Maximin in the fourth century spurious anti-Christian Acts of Pilate were composed in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, as we learn from <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. It is probable that the pseudographic letter was forged as an offset to these.</p>

<p>See the <a href="01111b.htm">separate article</a> under this title.</p>

<p><em>The Minor Pilate Apocrypha</em></p>

<p>The minor Pilate apocrypha, the <em><a href="01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> Pilati</em>, or "Relation of Pilate", is frequently found appended to the texts of the Acta. It presupposes the latter work, and could not have been composed before the middle of the fifth century. It is found in <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> combined with the <em>Paradoseis</em> or "Giving up of Pilate", which represents the oldest form of the legend dealing with <a href="12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> subsequent life. A still later fabrication is found in the Latin <em>Epistola Pilati ad Tiberium.</em> There exists a puerile correspondence consisting of a pretended <em>Letter of Herod to Pilate</em> and <em>Letter of Pilate to Herod.</em> They are found in Greek and Syriac in a <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the sixth or seventh century. These pseudographs may be as old as the fifth century.</p>

<p><em>The Narrative of Joseph of Arimathea</em></p>

<p>The Narrative of <a href="08520a.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a> &#151; furnishing imaginary details of the two thieves crucified with Christ, and the begging of the body from <a href="12083c.htm">Pilate</a> &#151; seems to have enjoyed popularity in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> in the Byzantine East, judging from the number of Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which remain. The oldest of those published belongs to the twelfth century. The relation is appended to some Latin texts of the Acta Pilati, under the title "Historia Josephi". It may be read in English in Walker's and the Ante-Nicene Father.' collection of the apocrypha.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Abgar</em></p>

<p>The oldest form of the Pseudo-Correspondence of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and <a href="01042c.htm">Abgar, King of Edessa</a>, is found in <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (Historia Ecclesiastica, I, xiii), who vouches that he himself translated it from the Syriac documents in the archives of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Eastern <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>. The two letters are accompanied by an introduction which probably is an excerpt from the same source. According to this, Abgar V, Toparch or King of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, suffering from an incurable disease, and having heard the fame of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> sends a courier to Jerusalem, bearing a letter to <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in which he declared Him to be a god, or the son of a god, and invites Him to <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, justifying the request partly by his desire to be cured, partly by his wish to offer to <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> an asylum against the malignant <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> replied as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Blessed are you because you have believed in Me without seeing Me. For it is written that those who have seen Me, will not believe Me; and that those who have not seen Me will believe and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> Me. But as to your <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> that I come to you, it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that I fulfil here all that for which I have been sent, and that after I have fulfilled it, that I be taken up to Him who has sent Me. But after my taking up I shall send you one of My disciples, who will heal your pains, and keep life for you and yours. </p></blockquote>

<p>Accordingly, after the <a href="01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, "Judas Thomas" an Apostle, despatches to <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> Thaddeus, one of the seventy Disciples, who cures the King of his disease, and preaches Christ to the assembled people. This, adds <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, happened in the year 340, i.e. of the <a href="13690a.htm">Seleucid</a> era; corresponding to A.D. 28-29. The pleasing story is repeated with variations in later sources. The "Teaching of Addai", a <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a> apocryphon (q.v. <em>infra</em>), reproduces the correspondence with additions.</p>

<p>The authenticity of the alleged letter of Christ has always been strongly suspected when not absolutely denied. As early as the sixth century the Gelasian Decretum brands this correspondence as spurious. Its legendary environment and the fact that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at large did not hand down the pretended epistle from <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> as a sacred document is conclusive against it. As for the letter of Abgar, its genuineness was formerly favoured by many skilled in this literature, but since the discovery of the "Teaching of Addai", published in 1876, the presumption against the authentic character of Abgar's epistle, owing to the close resemblance of a portion to passages in the Gospels, has become an established <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Lipsius, a high authority, is of the opinion that the Abgar correspondence goes back to the reign of the first <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> ruler of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, Abgar IX (179-216), and that it was elicited by a desire to force a link uniting that epoch with the time of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a></p>

<p><em>Letter of Lentulus</em></p>

<p>A brief letter professing to be from Lentulus, or <a href="09154a.htm">Publius Lentulus</a>, as in some <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, "President of the People of Jerusalem", addressed to "the Roman Senate and People", describes <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> personal appearance. It is evidently spurious, both the office and name of the president of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> being grossly unhistorical. No ancient writer alludes to this production, which is found only in Latin <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. It has been conjectured that it may have been composed in order to authenticate a pretended portrait of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. An English version is given in Cowper's <em>Apocryphal Gospels and Other Documents Relating to Christ</em> (New York, 6th ed., 1897).</p>

<h3 id="III3">Apocryphal acts of the apostles</h3>

<p>The motive which first prompted the fabrication of spurious <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> was, in general, to give Apostolic support to <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> systems, especially those of the many <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> which are comprised under the term <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. The darkness in which the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> leaves the missionary careers, and the ends of the greater number of the Apostles, and the meagre details handed down by <a href="15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a>, left an inviting field for the exercise of inventive imaginations, and offered an apt means for the insidious propagation of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The Jewish-Christian Church, which early developed un-Catholic tendencies in the form of <a href="05242c.htm">Ebionitism</a>, seems first to have produced apocryphal histories of the Apostles, though of these we have very few remains outside the material in the voluminous Pseudo-Clement. The <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Acts of Peter, Andrew, John, Thomas, and perhaps Matthew, date from the early portion of the third century or perhaps a little earlier. They abound in extravagant and highly coloured marvels, and were interspersed by long pretended discourses of the Apostles which served as vehicles for the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> predications. Though the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the learned repudiated these as patently <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> writings, they appealed to the fancy and satisfied the curiosity of the common people. Not only were they utilized by <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> in the East and Priscillianists in the West, but they found favour with many unenlightened <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Since it was impossible to suppress their circulation entirely, they were rendered comparatively harmless by <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> editing which expunged the palpable <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>, especially in the discourses, leaving the <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a> element to stand in its riotous exuberance. Hence most of the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Acts have come down to us with more or less of a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> purification, which, however, was in many cases so superficial as to leave unmistakable traces of their heterodox origin. The originally <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> apocryphal Acts were gathered into collections which bore the name of the <em>periodoi</em> (Circuits) or <em>praxeis</em> (Acts) of the Apostles, and to which was attached the name of a Leucius Charinus, who may have formed the compilation. The <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Acts were of various authorship. Another collection was formed in the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Church in the sixth century, probably by a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>. In this the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Acts have been preserved; it is by no means uniform in its various <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> representatives. By a misunderstanding, the authorship of the whole, under the title "Historia Certaminis Apostolorum", was ascribed to an Abdias, said to have been the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Babylon and a disciple of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The nucleus of this collection was formed by the Latin <em>Passiones,</em> or Martyrdoms, of those Apostles who had been neglected by the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Acts, viz., the two Jameses, Philip (Matthew?), Bartholomew, Simon, and Jude. The literature grew by accretions from <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> sources and eventually took in all the Apostles, including <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. The motive of these <a href="11330a.htm">non-heretical</a> apocrypha was primarily to gratify the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> curiosity of the faithful regarding the Apostolic founders of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; sometimes local interests instigated their composition. After the model of the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Acts, which were of Oriental derivation, they abound in prodigies, and like those again, they take as their starting-point the traditional dispersion of the Twelve from <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Regarding the historical value of these apocryphal narratives, it requires the most careful criticism to extricate from the mass of fable and legend any grains of historical <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. Even respecting the fields of the Apostolic missions, they are self-contradictory or confused. In general their details are scientifically worthless, unless confirmed by independent authorities, which rarely happens. Much of their apocryphal matter was taken up by the offices of the Apostles in the Latin breviaries and lectionaries, composed in the seventh and eighth centuries at an extremely uncritical period.</p>

<h3 id="A">Gnostic acts of the apostles</h3>

<p><em>Acts of St. Peter</em></p>

<p>There exist a Greek and a Latin Martyrdom of Peter, the latter attributed to <a href="09272b.htm">Pope Linus</a>, which from patristic citations are recognized as the conclusion of an ancient Greek narrative entitled "Acts, or Circuits of St. Peter". Another <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, bearing the name "Actus Petri cum Simone", contains a superior translation with several passages from the original narrative preceding the Martyrdom. The work betrays certain tokens of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, although it has been purged of its grossest features by a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reviser. It describes the triumph of St. Peter over <a href="13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the Apostle's subsequent crucifixion. These Acts as we have them are of high antiquity, though it is impossible to always discern whether patristic writers are quoting from them or an earlier tradition. Undoubtedly Commodian (c. 250) employed our extant Acts of Peter.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><em>Acts of St. John</em></p>

<p>The <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> character imputed to these by certain Fathers is fully confirmed by extant fragments, which show a gross <a href="05070c.htm">Docetism</a>, and an unbridled phantasy. Doubtless the author intermingled valuable Ephesian traditions with his fables. There are reasons of weight to regard the work as having been composed, together with the Acts of St. Peter, and probably those of St. Andrew, by a single <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>, in the latter half of the second century, under the name of a disciple of St. John, called Leucius. <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> was acquainted with the pseudograph. The Johannine Acts of the Pseudo-Prochorus (compare the canonical <a href="../bible/act006.htm#vrs5">Acts 6:5</a>) are a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> working-over of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> material.</p>

<p><em>Acts of St. Andrew</em></p>

<p>Pseudographic Acts of St. Andrew are noted by several early <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, as in circulation among <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> and <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>. The original form has perished except in a few patristic quotations. But we possess three individual Acts under different names, which prove to be <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> recensions of an original comprehensive <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> whole. These are:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>"The Acts of Andrew and Matthias" (or Matthew as given by some authorities)</li><li>"Acts of Peter and Andrew" (the original language of the above is Greek)</li><li>"The Martyrdom of the Apostle Andrew" has come down in both Greek and Latin recensions. The Latin text is the original one, and cannot be earlier than the fifth century. It purports to be a relation of the heroic death of St. Andrew by eyewitnesses who are "presbyters and <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="01101c.htm">Achaia</a>". It has enjoyed credit among historians in the past, but no reliance can be placed on its data. </li></ol></div>

<p>(See <a href="01634a.htm">APOSTOLIC CHURCHES</a>; <a href="01471a.htm">APOSTLE ST. ANDREW</a>.)</p>

<p><em>The Acts and Martyrdom of St. Matthew</em></p>

<p>The Acts and Martyrdom of St. Matthew are in literary dependence on the Acts of St. Andrew (q.v., <em>supra</em>), and hence the reading "Matthew" may be an <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> for "Matthias", since evidently the companion of Peter and Andrew is intended. The work exists in Greek and a later Latin. There is also a <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic</a>-<a href="01075e.htm">Ethiopic</a> <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> legend of St. Matthew. (See <a href="10056b.htm">ST. MATTHEW</a>; <a href="01626c.htm">APOSTLE</a>; <a href="01634a.htm">APOSTOLIC CHURCHES</a>).</p>

<p><em>Acts of St. Thomas</em></p>

<p>No Apostolic apocryphon has reached us in a completeness equal to that of the Thomas Acts. They are found in Greek, Syriac, and <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> recensions. Their <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> traits pierce through the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> re-touching; in fact, the contents show a conscious purpose to exalt the <a href="05169a.htm">dualistic</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of abstention from conjugal intercourse. Scholars are much inclined to attribute the original to a <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a> origin and an author who was an adherent of <a href="02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>. The signs point strongly to the third century as the era. The translation of the remains of St. Thomas to <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> in 232 may have furnished the inspiration for the composition. The Acts relate the prodigies performed by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostle</a> in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>, and end with his <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> there. They are interspersed with some remarkable <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>; some of real literary beauty but with strong <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> colouring. Recent researches have revealed elements of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> in the historical setting of the narrative. The Acts of St. Thomas are mentioned by Epiphanius and <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a> as in use in different <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> circles. St. Ephrem of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> refers to apocryphal Thomas Acts as in circulation among the <a href="02293a.htm">Bardesanites</a> (see ST. THOMAS).</p>

<p><em>Acts of St. Bartholomew</em></p>

<p>We possess a Greek Martrydom, dating in its present form from the fifth or sixth century; also a Latin "Passio Bartholom&aelig;i". Both are tainted with <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, and seem to have come from a single Bartholomew legend. The Greek text recounts the marvels by which the Apostle overthrew <a href="07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and converted a king and his subjects in "India". The whole is a legendary tissue. (See ST. BARTHOLOMEW, APOSTLE).</p>

<h3 id="B">Catholic apocryphal acts of the apostles</h3>

<p><em>Acts of Sts. Peter and Paul</em></p>

<p>These are to be distinguished from the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Acts of Peter and the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Acts of Paul. The <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which represent the legend fall into two groups:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>consisting of all but one of the Greek texts, containing an account of the journey of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the two Apostles.</li><li>composed of one Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> and a great number of Latin ones, presenting the history of the <em>passio</em> only.</li></ul></div>

<p>Lipsius regards the journey section as a ninth-century addition; Bardenhewer will have it to belong to the original document. This section begins with Paul's departure from the island of <a href="10303a.htm">Mileto</a>, and is evidently based on the canonical narrative in Acts. The <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> have been aroused by the news of Paul's intended visit, and induce <a href="10752c.htm">Nero</a> to forbid it. Nevertheless the Apostle secretly enters <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; his companion is mistaken for himself at Puteoli and beheaded. In retribution that city is swallowed up by the sea. Peter receives Paul at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with Joy. The preaching of the Apostles converts multitudes and even the Empress. <a href="13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> traduces the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers, and there is a test of strength in <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> between that magician and the Apostles, which takes place in the presence of <a href="10752c.htm">Nero</a>, Simon essays a flight to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> but falls in the Via Sacra and is dashed to pieces. Nevertheless, <a href="10752c.htm">Nero</a> is bent on the destruction of Peter and Paul. The latter is beheaded on the Ostian Way, and Peter is crucified at his request head downward. Before his death he relates to the people the "Quo Vadis?" story. Three men from the East carry off the Apostles' bodies but are overtaken. St. Peter is buried at "The place called the Vatican", and Paul on the Ostian Way. These Acts are the chief source for details of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the two great Apostles. They are also noteworthy as emphasizing the close concord between the Apostolic founders of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The date (A.D. 55) of composition is involved in obscurity. Lipsius finds traces of our Acts as early as <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (c. 235), but it is not clear that the Fathers adduced employed any written source for their references to the victory over <a href="13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> and the work of the Apostles at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Lipsius assigns the kernel of the Martyrdom to the second century; Bardenhewer refers the whole to the first half of the third. The Acts of Peter and Paul undoubtedly embody some genuine traditions. (<em>See</em> <a href="11744a.htm">ST. PETER</a>; <a href="11567b.htm">ST. PAUL</a>; <a href="13797b.htm">SIMON MAGUS</a>).</p>

<p><em>Acts of St. Paul</em></p>

<p><a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> and <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> expressly name the <em>praxeis Paulou</em>; <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks of writings falsely attributed to Paul: "<em>Quod si Pauli perperam inscripta legunt.</em>" He is cautioning his readers against the tale of Thecla preaching and <a href="02258b.htm">baptizing</a> herself. Hitherto it was supposed that he referred to the "Acts of Paul and Thecla". The "Acta Pauli", presumed to be a distinct composition, were deemed to have perished; but recently (1899) a Coptic papyrus <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, torn to shreds, was found in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and proves to contain approximately complete the identical Acts of Paul alluded to by a few <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers. This find has established the fact that the long-known Acts of Paul and Thecla and the apocryphal correspondence of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> with the Corinthian Church, as well as the Martyrdom of St. Paul, are really only excerpts from the original Pauline Acts. The newly-discovered document contains material hitherto unknown as well as the above-noted sections, long extant. It begins with a pretended flight of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> from <a href="01570a.htm#II">Antioch of Pisidia</a>, and ends with his <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The narrative rests on data in the canonical books of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, but it abounds in marvels and personages unhinted at there, and it disfigures traits of some of those actually mentioned in the Sacred Writings. The Acts of Paul, therefore, adds nothing trustworthy to our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="11567b.htm">Apostle of the Gentiles</a>. Fortunately the above-cited passage of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De Baptismo, xvii) informs us of its authorship and aim. The African writer observes that the pseudo-history was the work of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, who on the discovery of the <a href="06249a.htm">fraud</a>, was deposed from an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> charge, and confessed that he forged the book out of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Experts ascribe its composition to the second century. It was already known when <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> wrote, and during the first centuries enjoyed a considerable popularity, both East and West. In fact <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> classes it among the <em>antilegomena,</em> or works having locally quasi-canonical authority.</p>

<p><em>Acts of Paul and Thecla</em></p>

<p>The early detachment of these as well as the Martyrdom from the Acts of St. Paul may be accounted for by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> use as festal lections. Despite <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> remark regarding this pseudograph, it enjoyed an immense and persistent popularity through the patristic period and the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. This favour is to be explained mainly by the romantic and spirited flavour of the narrative. Exceptional among the apocryphists, the author kept a curb upon his fertile <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and his production is distinguished by its simplicity, clearness, and vigour. It deals with the adventures of Thecla, a young <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, who upon being converted by <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> preaching, left her bridegroom and lived a life of virginity and missionary activity, becoming a companion of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and preaching the Gospel. She is <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, but <a href="10338a.htm">miraculously</a> escapes from the fire and the savage beasts of the arena. The relief into which abstention from the marriage-bed is brought in these Acts makes it difficult to escape from the conclusion that they have been coloured by <a href="05412c.htm">Encratite</a> <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Nevertheless the thesis of Lipsius, supported by Corssen, that a <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <em>Grundschrift</em> underlies our present document, is not accepted by Harnack, Zahn, Bardenhewer, and others. The apocryphon follows the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> data of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> missions very loosely and is full of unhistorical characters and events. For instance, the writer introduces a journey of the Apostles, to which there is nothing analogous in the Sacred Books. However, there are grains of historical material in the Thecla story. A <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgin of that name may well have been converted by <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> at <a href="07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, and suffered <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Gutschmid has discovered that a certain Queen Tryphena was an historical personage (Rheinisches Museum f&uuml;r Philologie, X, 1864). (See <a href="14563a.htm">THECLA</a>.)</p>

<p><em>Acts of St. Philip</em></p>

<p>The extant Greek fragments supply us with all but five (10-14) of the fifteen Acts composing the work. Of these 1-7 are a farrago of various legends, each, it would seem, with an independent history; 8-14 is a unit, which forms a parasitic growth on the ancient but somewhat confused traditions of the missionary activity of an Apostle Philip in Hierapolis of Phrygia. Zahn's view, that this document is the work of an ill-informed <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of the fourth century, is a satisfactory hypothesis. The largest fragment was first published by Batiffol in "Analecta Bollandiana", IX (Paris, 1890). A Coptic "Acts of Philip" is also to be noted. (See ST. PHILIP, APOSTLE)</p>

<p>There are Latin, Coptic, <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a>, and <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> histories of the missions and death of <a href="08279b.htm">St. James the Greater</a>, the son of Zebedee. Lipsius assigns the Latin to about the third century. Coptic and <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Acts and Martyrdom of <a href="08280a.htm">St. James the Less</a> depend mostly on the Hegesippus tradition, preserved by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.22</a>).</p>

<p><em>Acts of St. Matthew</em></p>

<p>The Apostolic Acts of the Pseudo-Abdias contain a Latin "Passio Sancti Matth&aelig;i", which preserves an <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> legend of St. Matthew, later than the Coptic Martyrdom noticed in connection with the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Acts of that saint. The correct historical setting indicates that the recension was the work of an <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> of the sixth century, who wished to date the establishment of the <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Church (fourth century) back to the Apostolic times. However, the kernel of the narrative is drawn from older sources. The Abdias <em>Passio</em> places St. Matthew's <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>. (See <a href="10056b.htm">ST. MATTHEW, APOSTLE</a>)</p>

<p><em>Teaching of Addai (Thaddeus)</em></p>

<p>In 1876 an ancient Syriac document, entitled <a href="05088a.htm">"The Teaching of Addai, the Apostle"</a>, was published for the first time. It <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> to closely parallel the Abgar material derived by <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> from the <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> archives, and indeed purports to have been entrusted to those archives by its author, who gives his name as Labubna, the son of Senaak. It is full of legendary but interesting material describing the relations between <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and King Abgar of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. Thaddeus, or Addai, one of the seventy disciples, is sent, after the <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, in compliance with <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise, to Abgar, heals the ruler and <a href="03712a.htm">Christianizes</a> <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> with the most prompt and brilliant success. Notable is the story of the <a href="11395a.htm">painting</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> made at the instance of Abgar's envoy to the former. Since the narrative of a Gaulish pilgrim who visited <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> about 390 contains no allusion to such a picture, we may reasonably conclude that the Teaching of Addai is of later origin. Critics accept the period between 399-430. The Thaddeus legend has many ramifications and has undergone a number of variations. There is a Greek "Acts of Thaddeus", which identifies Addai with Thaddeus or Lebb&aelig;us, one of the Twelve. (See <a href="01042c.htm">ABGAR</a>; <a href="05282a.htm">EDESSA</a>).</p>

<p><em>Acts of Simon and Jude</em></p>

<p>A Latin <em>Passio,</em> which Lipsius attributes to the fourth or fifth century, narrates the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>, conversions, and <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of these Apostles. It is found in the Abdias collection. The scene is <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a> and <a href="02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>. It has been recognized that the historical setting of these Acts agrees remarkably with what is known of the conditions in the Parthian empire in the first century after Christ.</p>

<p><em>The Acts of St. Barnabas</em></p>

<p>The Acts of <a href="02300a.htm">St. Barnabas</a> appear to have been composed toward the end of the fifth century by a <a href="04589a.htm">Cypriot</a>. They are ascribed to <a href="09674b.htm">St. Mark the Evangelist</a>, and are historically worthless. They are extant in the original Greek and in a Latin version. The narrative is based upon the mutual relations and activities of Barnabas, Mark, and Paul, as recorded in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>.</p>

<p><em>Gesta Matthi&aelig;</em></p>

<p>This is the latest of the pseudo-Acts, having been composed by a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of Tr&egrave;ves, in the twelfth century, as a prelude to an account of the translation of the <a href="12734a.htm">sacred relic</a>, and the body of <a href="10066a.htm">St. Matthias</a> to that city, and their subsequent rediscoveries. It pretends to have derived the history of the Apostle's career from a Hebrew <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. (See ST. MATTHIAS, APOSTLE)</p>

<h3 id="C">Quasi-apostolic acts</h3>

<p>It must suffice to mention "Acts of St. Mark", of Alexandrian origin, and written in the fourth or fifth century; "Acts of St. Luke", Coptic, not earlier than end of fourth; "Acts of St. Timothy", composed by an Ephesian after 425; "Acts of St. Titus", of Cretan origin, between 400-700; "Acts of Kanthippe and Polyxena", connected with the legends about <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and St. Andrew.</p>

<h3 id="III4">Apocryphal doctrinal works</h3>

<p><em>Testamentum Domini Nostri Jesu</em></p>

<p>It was known that a Syriac work of this name existed, and an extract was published in 1856. In 1899 Monsignor Rahmani, <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the United Syrians, published from a late <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> the Syriac text, a Latin introduction and translation. The work is in two books. It begins with an apocalypse of the approaching day of <a href="01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> alleged to have been uttered by <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> after His <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Between this and the body of the work there is a very loose connection, as the main portion represents Christ as enacting, even to small details, <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> for the governance and ritual of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The writer places on <a href="08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> lips descriptions of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> observances prevalent in his own and earlier periods. There are evident points of contact between the Testament and the ancient ecclesiastico-liturgical Canones Hippolyti, Apostolic Constitutions, and <a href="03279a.htm">Apostolic Canons</a>. Monsignor Rahmani assigns the Testament to the second century, and places the above works in the relation of dependence on it. But critics unanimously refuse to accord a high antiquity to the Testament, dating it in the fourth or fifth century, and inverting the dependence mentioned. On the ground that there is no indication of an acquaintance with the book outside the Orient, and that Arabic and Coptic recensions of it are known, Dr. A. Baumstark regards the work as a compilation originating in <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> circles, and current in the national Churches of that <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The apocalyptic opening has been found in a Latin <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the eighth century, and published by M. R. James, "Apocrypha Anecdota" (Cambridge, 1893).</p>

<p><em>The Preaching of Peter or Kerygma Petri.</em></p>

<p><a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> repeatedly quotes from a <em>kerygma Petrou</em>, concerning whose credibility he obviously has no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>. On the other hand, <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> classes it as apocryphal. A certain "Doctrine of Peter", mentioned by a later writer, was probably identical with the "Preaching". From the scanty remains of this work we can form but a very imperfect <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of it. It spoke in St. Peter's name and represented him above all as a teacher of the <a href="06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> parts occur in a framework of an account of the missionary journeys. The pseudograph was probably suggested by the text, II Peter, i, 5. A work which was so well accredited in the days of <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (c. 140-215), and which was known to the "Gnostic Heracleon" (c. 160-170), must have come from almost Apostolic antiquity. Scholars favour the first quarter of the second century. The fragments which remain betray no signs of heterodox origin. There is a Syriac "Preaching of Simon Peter in the City of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>."</p>

<p><em>Two Ways or Judicium Petri</em></p>

<p>This is a moralizing treatise ascribed to St. Peter, and prefixed to the <a href="04779a.htm">Didache</a>. It is of <a href="08537a.htm">Jewish-Christian</a> origin, and probably was based on the so-called "Epistle of Barnabas".</p>

<p><em>Preaching of Paul</em></p>

<p>The only witness to this work is the treatise "De Rebaptismo" in the pseudo-Cyprian writings. According to this it represented Christ as confessing personal <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, and forced by His mother to receive <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<h3 id="III5">Apocryphal epistles</h3>

<p><em>Pseudo-Epistles of the Blessed Virgin</em></p>

<p>These are all composed in Latin and at late dates.</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>The Epistle of the Blessed Virgin to St. Ignatius Martyr fills but nine lines in the <a href="05745a.htm">Fabricius</a> edition of the apocrypha. It exhorts to <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>. There is a reply from Ignatius.</li><li>The Epistle to the Messanienses, i.e. the inhabitants of <a href="10216a.htm">Messina</a>, <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, is equally brief; it conveys an exhortation to <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, and a blessing.</li><li>The Epistle to the Florentines was expounded in a sermon of <a href="13490a.htm">Savonarola</a>, 25 October, 1495. We have no other testimony of it. It is four lines in length.</li></ul></div>

<p><em>Pseudo-Epistle of St. Peter to St. James the Less</em></p>

<p>The Pseudo-Clementine <a href="07448a.htm">homilies</a> contain as a preface two letters, the first of which purports to be from Peter to James the Less, beseeching him to keep his (Peter's) preaching secret. (See CLEMENTINE PSEUDO-WRITINGS)</p>

<p><em>Pseudo-Epistles of St. Paul; Correspondence with the Corinthians</em></p>

<p>The ancient Syrian (Edessene) Church revered as canonical a Third Epistle of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> to the Corinthians, which is accompanied by a letter from the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> of that Church, to which it is an answer. But about the beginning of the fifth century the Syrian Church fell under the influence of the Greek, and in consequence the spurious letter gradually lost its canonical status. It was taken up by the neighbouring <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and for centuries has formed a part of the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Latin and Greek writers are completely silent about this pseudograph, although Greek and Latin copies have been found. It was obviously suggested by the lost genuine Pauline letter referred to in <a href="../bible/1co005.htm#vrs9">1 Corinthians 5:9</a> and <a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs1">7:1</a>. It was composed by a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">presbyter</a> about 160-170, and is a disguised attack on some of the leading <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. This correspondence long had an independent circulation, but recently it has been <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that the document was incorporated into the Acts of St. Paul (q.v.).</p>

<p><em>Pseudo-epistle to the Laodiceans</em></p>

<p>In the genuine Epistle to the Colossians, Paul, after instructing them to send their Epistle to <a href="08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, adds: "read that which is from the Laodiceans". This most probably regards a circular letter, the canonical "Ephesians"; but it has been held to be a lost letter to the Laodicean <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The apocryphal epistle is a transparent attempt to supply this supposed lost sacred document. It consists of twenty short lines and is mainly made of matter taken from Philippians and other Epistles, and pieced together without sequence or <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> aim. Our apocryphon exists only in Latin and translations from the Latin, though it gives signs of a Greek original. It can hardly be the pseudo-Laodicean letter said by the <a href="10642a.htm">Muratorian Fragment</a> to have been invented by the heresiarch <a href="09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. Despite its insipid and suspicious character, this compilation was frequently copied in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and enjoyed a certain degree of respect, although <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> had written of it: <em>ab omnibus exploditur.</em> (See <a href="08794a.htm">LAODICEA</a>.) The Muratorian Fragmentist mentions together with a spurious epistle of Paul to the Laodiceans, one to the Alexandrians, which was forged under the auspices of <a href="09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. We have no other certain <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this apocryphon.</p>

<p><em>Pseudo-Correspondence of St. Paul and Seneca</em></p>

<p>This consists of eight pretended letters from the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoic</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Seneca, and six replies from <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. They are identical with a correspondence alluded to by Jerome (de Viris Illustr., xii), who without passing judgment on their value, notes that they are read by many. These letters, therefore, could not have been composed after the second half of the fourth century. They are based on the early traditions of Seneca's leanings towards <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the contemporary residence at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> of Paul and the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. We will merely note the existence of a spurious Letter of St. John, the Apostle, to a dropsical man, healing his disease, in the Acts of St. John by the pseudo-Prochorus; one of St. James, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to Quadratus, in <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> (Vetter, Litterarische Rundschau, 1896).</p>

<h3 id="III6">Christian apocryphal apocalypses</h3>

<p><em>Apocalypse of the Testamentum D.N. Jesu Christi.</em></p>

<p>(See the section on the <em>Testamentum</em> above.)</p>

<p><em>The Apocalypse of Mary</em></p>

<p>The Apocalypse of Mary is of <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> origin, and is probably merely the outcome of an extravagant devotion. It describes the Blessed Mother's descent to Limbo, and exists in Greek <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. It has been printed in the Tischendorf collection (Codex Apocryphus Novi Testamenti).</p>

<p><em>Apocalypses of St. Peter</em></p>

<p>The <a href="10642a.htm">Muratorian Fragment</a>, written at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the latter part of the second century, names the apocalypses of John and Peter side by side as the only ones received in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, remarking that some do not acknowledge the latter. There is abundant evidence that the Petrine apocalypse was believed authentic in many quarters of the early Church, and enjoyed in a certain measure canonical authority. <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> always credulous with regard to apocrypha even <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> it with a commentary; <a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.14.1</a>), places it almost on an equality with the <em>antilegomena</em> or better class of disputed writings; Jerome rejects it flatly. Notwithstanding this, as late as the middle of the fifth century it was publicly read in some churches of Palestine. The few citations of patristic writers were unable to convey an <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of its contents, but fortunately a considerable fragment of this ancient document was discovered at Akhm&icirc;n, <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, together with the pseudo-Petrine Gospel in the language of the original, viz., Greek. A quotation of <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> from the recovered parts enables us to identify the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> as a portion of the apocalypse of antiquity. The passage relates to a vision granted by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the Twelve on a mountain, exhibiting the glory of two departing brethren, the splendour of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and a gruesome picture of <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a>. The language has a Jewish-Christian savour. The apocryphon is attributed by critics to the first quarter of the second century and is therefore one of the earliest specimens of non-canonical literature. There exist under the names Apocalypse of St. Peter, Apocalypse of St. Peter through Clement, Liber Clementis, various Arabic and <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> recensions of an apocalypse which has nothing in common with the ancient Greek one.</p>

<p><em>The Apocalypse of St. Paul</em></p>

<p>A prefatory notice pretends that this work was found in a marble case under the house of Paul at <a href="14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, in the reign of <a href="14577d.htm">King Theodosius</a> (A.D. 379-395), and upon intelligence conveyed by an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a>. This indicates the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the apocalypse's fabrication. It purports to reveal the secrets seen by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostle</a> in his transport to the third <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, alluded to in <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs2">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, and was composed in Greek. From this Pauline apocalypse must be distinguished a <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> work entitled the "Ascension of Paul", referred to by <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, but of which no remains have survived. There is a spurious "Apocalypse of John", of comparatively late origin. Regarding the so-called <em>Apocalypse of St. Bartholomew</em> see <em>Gospel of St. Bartholomew.</em></p>

<h2 id="iv">The apocrypha and the Church</h2>

<p>At a very early period <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> writers and, presumably, <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> found it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to distinguish between the genuine inspired books and a multitude of spurious rivals &#151; a fact which is a very important element in the formation of the <a href="03274a.htm">Christian canon</a>. Thus as early as about A.D. 170, the author of the descriptive Latin catalogue known as the "Muratorian Fragment" mentioned certain works as fictitious or contested. At the same time <a href="08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a> called attention to the great mass of <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> pseudographic writings (<em>inenarrabilis multitudo apocryphorum et perperam scripturarum,</em> Adv., H&aelig;r., I, xx). Undoubtedly it was the large use <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> circles, especially the <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>, made of this insinuating literature which first called forth the animadversions of the official guardians of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> purity. Even in the East, already the home of pseudographic literature, <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (d. 254) exhibits caution regarding the books outside the canon (Comment. in Matth., serm. 28). <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> in 387 found it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to warn his flock by a pastoral epistle against Jewish and <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> apocrypha (P.G., XXVI, 1438). Another Greek Father, Epiphanius (312-403) in "H&aelig;reses", 26, could complain that copies of <a href="06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> apocrypha were current in thousands. Yet it must be confessed that the early Fathers, and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, during the first three centuries, were more indulgent towards Jewish pseudographs circulating under venerable <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> names. The Book of Henoch and the Assumption of Moses had been cited by the canonical Epistle of Jude. Many Fathers admitted the inspiration of Fourth Esdras. Not to mention the Shepherd of Hermas, the Acts of St. Paul (at least in the Thecla portion) and the Apocalypse of St. Peter were highly revered at this and later periods. Yet, withal, no apocryphal work found official recognition in the <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a>. In 447 <a href="09154b.htm">Pope Leo the Great</a> wrote pointedly against the pseudo-apostolic writings, "which contained the germ of so many <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> . . . they should not only be forbidden but completely suppressed and burned" (Epist. xv, 15). The so-called Decretum de recipiendis et non recipiendis libris" is attributed to Pope Gelasius (495), but in reality is a compilation <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from the beginning of the sixth century, and containing collections made earlier than Gelasius. It is an official document, the first of the kind we possess, and contained a list of 39 works besides those ascribed to Leucius, "disciple of the devil", all of which it condemns as apocryphal. From this catalogue it is evident that in the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> by this time, apocrypha in general, including those of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> origin, had fallen under the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ban, always, however, with a preoccupation against the danger of <a href="07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a>. The <a href="02729a.htm">Synod of Braga</a>, in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, held in the year 563, <a href="01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> any one "who reads, approves, or defends the injurious fictions set in circulation by <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>". Although in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> these condemnations were forgotten and many of the pseudographic writings enjoyed a high degree of favour among both <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> and the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, still we find superior minds, such as <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, pointing out their want of authority. An echo of the ancient condemnations occurs in the work De Festis B.M.V. of <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, declaring certain popular apocrypha to be impure sources of tradition. (See CANON OF SACRED SCRIPTURE.)</p>
