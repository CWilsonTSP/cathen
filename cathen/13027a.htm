<h2 id="section1">Description, development, and division</h2>

<p>By rhythmical office is meant a <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> horary <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the <a href="07500b.htm">canonical hours</a> of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, or an office of the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, in which not only the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> are regulated by a certain rhythm, but where, with the exception of the psalms and lessons, practically all the other parts show metre, rhythm, or rhyme; such parts for instance as the <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> to each psalm, to the Magnificat, Invitatorium, and Benedictus, likewise the responses and versicles to the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and after each of the nine lessons; quite often also the benedictions before the lessons, and the <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> to the minor <em>Hor&oelig;</em> (Prime, <a href="14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, and None).</p>

<p>The old technical term for such an office was <em>Historia</em>, with or without an additional "<em>rhytmata</em>" or <em>rimata</em>, an expression that frequently caused misunderstanding on the part of later writers. The reason for the name lay in the fact that originally the <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> or the responses, and sometimes the two together, served to amplify or comment upon the history of a <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, of which there was a brief sketch in the readings of the second nocturn. Gradually this name was transferred to offices in which no word was said about a "history", and thus we find the expression "Historia ss. Trinitatis". The structure of the ordinary office of the <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a> in which <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, psalms, <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, lessons, and responses followed one another in fixed order, was the natural form for the rhythmical office. It was not a question of inventing something new, as with the <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a>, sequences, or other kinds of poetry, but of creating a text in poetic form in the place of a text in prose form, where the scheme existed, definitely arranged in all its parts. A development therefore which could eventually serve as a basis for the division of the rhythmical offices into distinct classes is of itself limited to a narrow field, namely the external form of the parts of the office as they appear in poetic garb. Here we find in historical order the following characters:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>a metrical, of hexameters intermixed with prose or rhymed prose;</li><li>a rhythmical, in the broadest sense, which will be explained below;</li><li>a form embellished by strict rhythm and rhyme.</li></ol></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Consequently one may distinguish three classes of rhythmical offices:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>metrical offices, in hexameters or distichs;</li><li>offices in rhymed prose, i.e., offices with very free and irregular rhythm, or with dissimilar assonant long lines;</li><li>rhymed offices with regular rhythm and harmonious artistic structure.</li></ol></div>

<p>The second class represents a state of transition, wherefore the groups may be called those of the first epoch, the groups of the transition period, and those of the third epoch, in the same way as with the sequences, although with the latter the characteristic difference is much more pronounced. If one desires a general name for all three groups, the expression "Rhymed Office", as suggested by "<em>Historia rimata</em>" would be quite appropriate for the <em>pars major et potior</em>, which includes the best and most artistic offices; this designation: "<em>gereimtes Officium</em>" (<em>Reimofficium</em>) has been adopted in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> through the "Analecta Hymnica". The term does not give absolute satisfaction, because the first and oldest offices are without rhyme, and cannot very well be called rhymed offices. In the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the word "rhythmical" was used as the general term for any kind of poetry to be distinguished from prose, no matter whether there was regular rhythm in those poems or not. And for that reason it is practical to comprise in the name "rhythmical offices" all those which are other than pure prose, a designation corresponding to the "Historia rhytmata".</p>

<p>Apart from the predilection of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> for the poetic form, the Vit&oelig; metric&oelig; of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> were the point of departure and motive for the rhythmical offices. Those Vit&oelig; were frequently composed in hexameters or distichs. From them various couples of hexameters or a distich were taken to be used as antiphon or response respectively. In case the hexameters of the <em>Vit&oelig; metric&oelig;</em> did not prove suitable enough, the lacking parts of the office were supplemented by simple prose or by means of verses in rhymed prose, i.e., by text lines of different length in which there was very little of rhythm, but simply assonance. Such offices are often a motley mixture of hexameters, rhythmical stanzas, stanzas in pure prose, and again in rhymed prose. An example of an old metrical office, intermixed with Prose Responses, is that of <a href="08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a> (Anal. Hymn., XXVII, no. 79), where all the <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> are borrowed from that saint's <em>Vit&oelig; metric&oelig;</em>, presumably the work of Hucbald-Amand of St. Amand; the office itself was composed by Bishop Stephen of <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> about the end of the ninth century:</p>

<blockquote><p>Antiphona I: Orbita solaris pr&aelig;sentia gaudia confert Pr&aelig;sulis eximii Lantberti gesta revolvens.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Antiphona II: Hic fuit ad tempus Hildrici regis in aula, <br>Dilectus cunctis et vocis famine dulcis.</p></blockquote>

<p>A mixing of hexameters, of rhythmical stanzas, and of stanzas formed by unequal lines in rhymed prose is shown in the old Office of Rictrudis, composed by Hucbald-Amand about 907 (Anal. Hymn., XIII, no. 87). By the side of regular hexameters, as in the Invitatorium:</p>

<blockquote><p>Rictrudis sponso sit laus et gloria, Christo, <br>Pro cuius merito iubilemus ei vigilando.</p></blockquote>

<p>we find rhythmical stanzas, like the first antiphon to <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Beata Dei famula <br>Rictrudis, adhuc posita <br>In terris, mente devota <br>Christo h&aelig;rebat in &aelig;hra;</p></blockquote>

<p>or stanzas in very free rhythm, as e.g., the second response to the first <a href="11087b.htm">nocturn</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>H&aelig;c femina laudabilis <br>Meritisque honorabilis <br>Rictrudis egregia <br>Divina providentia <br>Pervenit in Galliam, <br>Pr&aelig;claris orta natalibus, <br>Honestis alta et instituta moribus.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the metrical offices, from the pure as well as from those mixed with rhymed prose, the transition was soon made to such as consisted of rhymed prose merely. An example of this kind is in the Offices of Ulrich, composed by Abbot <a href="02512a.htm">Berno of Reichenau</a> (d. 1048); the antiphon to the Magnificat of the first <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> begins thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>Venerandi patris Wodalrici sollemnia <br>Magn&aelig; jucunditatis repr&aelig;sentant gaudia, <br>Qu&aelig; merito cleri suscipiuntur voto <br>Ac populi celebrantur tripudio. <br>L&aelig;tetur tellus tali compta pr&aelig;sule, <br>Exsultet polus tanto ditatus compare; <br>Solus d&aelig;mon ingemat, qui ad eius sepulcrum <br>Suum assidue perdit dominium . . . etc.</p></blockquote>





<p>Much more perfectly developed on the other hand, is the rhythm in the Office which <a href="09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> composed in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (Anal. Hymn., V, no. 64). This office, the work of a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, appeared in the eleventh century in the Roman breviaries, and soon enjoyed widespread circulation; all its verses are iambic dimeters, but the rhythm does not as yet coincide with the natural accent of the word, and many a verse has a syllable in excess or a syllable wanting. For example, the first antiphon of the first nocturn:</p>

<blockquote><p>Gregorius ortus Rom&aelig; <br>E senatorum sanguine <br>Fulsit mundo velut gemma <br>Auro superaddita, <br>Dum pr&aelig;clarior pr&aelig;claris <br>Hic accessit atavis.</p></blockquote>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>This author does not yet make use of pure rhyme, but only of assonance, the precursor of rhyme. Hence we have before us an example of transition from offices of the first epoch to those of the second. With these latter the highest development of the rhythmical office is reached. It is marvellous how in many offices of this artistic period, in spite of all symmetry in rhythm and rhyme, the greatest variety exists in the structure of the stanzas, how a smooth and refined language matches the rich contents full of deep <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and how the individual parts are joined together in a complete and most striking picture of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> or of the mystery to be celebrated. A prominent example is the Office of the Trinity by <a href="11599b.htm">Archbishop Pecham</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>.</p>

<p>The first <a href="15381a.htm">Vespers</a> begins with the <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a>:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>Sedenti super solium <br>Congratulans trishagium <br>Seraphici clamoris <br>Cum patre laudat filium <br>Indifferens principium <br>Reciproci amoris.</li><li>Sequamur per suspirium, <br>Quod geritur et gaudium <br>In sanctis c&aelig;li choris; <br>Levemus cordis studium <br>In trinum lucis radium <br>Splendoris et amoris.</li></ol></div>

<p>It is interesting to compare with the preceding the <a href="01575b.htm">antiphons</a> to the first nocturn, which have quite a different structure; the third of them exhibits the profound thought:</p>

<blockquote><p>Leventur cordis ostia: <br>Memoria <em>Giguenti</em> <br><em>Nato</em> intelligentia, <br>Voluntas <em>Procedenti</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>again the first response to the third nocturn:</p>

<blockquote><p>Candor lucis, perpurum speculum <br>Patris splendor, perlustrans s&aelig;culum, <br>Nubis levis intrans umbraculum <br>In &AElig;gypti venit ergastulum. <br>Virgo circumdedit virum <br>Mel mandentem et butyrum.</p></blockquote>

<p>upon which follows as second response the beautiful picture of the Trinity in the following form:</p>

<blockquote><p>A Veterani facie manavit ardens fiuvius: <br>Antiquus est ingenitus, et facies est Filius, <br>Ardoris fluxus Spiritus, duorum amor medius. <br>Sic olim multifarie <br>Prophetis luxit Trinitas, <br>Quam post pandit ecclesi&aelig; <br>In carne fulgens veritas.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="section2">History and significance</h2>

<p>It cannot be definitely stated which of the three old <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a>: Pr&uuml;m, Land&eacute;vennec, or Saint-Amand can claim priority in composing a rhythmical office. There is no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> however that Saint-Amand and the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Hainault, <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and Brabant, was the real starting-point of this style of poetry, as long ago as the ninth century. The pioneer in music, the Monk Hucbald-Amand of Saint-Amand, composed at least two, probably four, rhythmical offices; and the larger number of the older offices were used liturgically in those <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and cities which had some connexion with Saint-Amand. From there this new branch of hymnody very soon found its way to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and in the tenth and eleventh, and particularly in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, showed fine, if not the finest results, both in quality and quantity. Worthy of especial mention as poets of this order are: the Abbots Odo (927-42) and Odilo (994-1049) of Cluny, Bishop <a href="06312a.htm">Fulbert of Chartres</a> (1017-28), the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monk Odorannus of <a href="13716a.htm">Sens</a> (died 1045), <a href="09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> (died 1054); <a href="14291c.htm">Bishop Stephen of Tournay</a> (1192-1203); Archdeacon Rainald of <a href="10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> in Angers (died about 1074); Bishop Richard de Gerberoy of <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a> (1204-10); Prior Arnaud du Pr&egrave; of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (died 1306), and the General of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, Martialis Auribelli, who in 1456 wrote a rhymed office for the purpose of glorifying St. Vincent Ferrer. The most eminent poet and composer of offices belongs to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> by birth, but more so to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by reason of his activity; he is Julian von Speyer, director of the orchestra at the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> royal court, afterwards <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friar</a> and choir master in the <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>, where about 1240 he composed words and music for the two well-known offices in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> and of <a href="01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> (Anal. Hymn., V, nos. 61 and 42). These two productions, the musical value of which has in many ways been overestimated, served as a prototype for a goodly number of successive offices in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> as well as of others. In <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> the rhymed offices were just as popular as in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. As early as in the ninth century an office, in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Chrysantus and Daria, had its origin probably in Pr&uuml;m, perhaps through Friar Wandalbert (Anal. Hymn., XXV, no. 73); perhaps not much later through Abbot Gurdestin of Land&eacute;vennec a similar poem in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Winwal&oelig;us (Anal. Hymn., XVIII, no. 100). As hailing from <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> two other composers of rhythmical offices in the earlier period have become known: Abbot <a href="02512a.htm">Berno of Reichenau</a> (died 1048) and Abbot Udalschalc of Maischach at <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> (died 1150).</p>

<p>The other German poets whose names can be given belong to a period as late as the fifteenth century, as e.g. Provost Lippold of Steinberg and Bishop Johann Hofmann of <a href="10148b.htm">Meissen</a>. <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> took an early part in this style of poetry, but unfortunately most of the offices which originated there have been lost. Brilliant among the English poets is <a href="11599b.htm">Archbishop Pecham</a> whose office of the Trinity has been discussed above. Next to him are worthy of especial mention <a href="05240b.htm">Cardinal Adam Easton</a> (died 1397) and the <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> John Horneby of Lincoln, who about 1370 composed a rhymed office in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Holy Name of Jesus, and of the Visitation of Our Lady. <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> seems to have a relatively small representation; <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, i.e. the <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>, as we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>, did not favour innovations, and consequently was reluctant to adopt rhythmical offices. The famous Archbishop Alfons of <a href="13396b.htm">Salerno</a> (1058-85) is presumably the oldest Italian poet of this kind. Besides him we can name only Abbot Reinaldus de Colle di Mezzo (twelfth century), and the General of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Raymundus de Vineis from <a href="03319a.htm">Capua</a> (fourteenth century). In <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> the rhymed offices were popular and quite numerous, but with the exception of the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fra Gil de Zamora, who about the middle of the fifteenth century composed an office in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> (Anal. Hymn., XVII, no. 8) it has been impossible to cite by name from those two countries any other poet who took part in composing rhythmical offices. Towards the close of the thirteenth century, Scandinavia also comes to the fore with rhymed offices, in a most dignified manner. Special attention should be called to Bishop Brynolphus of <a href="16074b.htm">Skara</a> (1278-1317), Archbishop Birgerus Gregorii of Upsala (died 1383), Bishop Nicolaus of <a href="16053b.htm">Link&ouml;ping</a> (1374-91), and Johannes Benechini of Oeland (about 1440). The number of offices where the composer's name is known is insignificantly small. No less than seven hundred anonymous rhythmical offices have been brought to light during the last twenty years through the "Analecta Hymnica". It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> not all of them are works of art; particularly during the fifteenth century many offices with tasteless rhyming and shallow contents reflect the general decadence of hymnody. Many, however, belong to the best products of religious lyric poetry. For six centuries in all countries of the West, men of different ranks and stations in life, among them the highest dignitaries of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, took part in this style of poetry, which enjoyed absolute popularity in all <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Hence one may surmise the significance of the rhythmical offices with reference to the history of civilization, their importance in history and development of liturgy, and above all their influence on other poetry and literature.</p>
