<p><a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>, born about 315; died probably 18 March, 386. In the East his <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is observed on the 18th of March, in the West on the 18th or 20th. Little is known of his life. We gather information concerning him from his younger contemporaries, Epiphanius, <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, and Rufinus, as well as from the fifth-century historians, <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> and Theodoret. Cyril himself gives us the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of his "Catecheses" as fully seventy years after the Emperor Probus, that is about 347, if he is exact. Constans (d. 350) was then still alive. Mader thinks Cyril was already <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but it is usually held that he was at this <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> only as a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> relates (Chron. <em>ad ann.</em> 352) that Cyril had been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> by St. Maximus, his predecessor, after whose death the episcopate was promised to Cyril by the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, <a href="01081a.htm">Acacius of Caesarea</a>, and the other <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, on condition that he should repudiate the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> he had received from Maximus. He consented to minister as <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> only, and was rewarded for this impiety with the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. Maximus had <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Heraclius to succeed himself, but Cyril, by various <a href="06249a.htm">frauds</a>, degraded Heraclius to the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. So says <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>; but <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a> relates that Acacius drove out St. Maximus and substituted St. Cyril. A quarrel soon broke out between Cyril and Acacius, apparently on a question of precedence or <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. At Nicaea the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of Caesarea had been guarded, while a special dignity had been granted to Jerusalem. Yet St. Maximus had held a synod and had <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This may have been as much as the cause of Acacius' enmity to him as his attachment to the Nicene formula. On the other hand, Cyril's correct <a href="14597a.htm">Christology</a> may have been the real though veiled ground of the hostility of Acacius to him. At all events, in 357 Acacius caused Cyril to be exiled on the charge of selling church furniture during a famine. Cyril took refuge with Silvanus, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Taraus. He appeared at the Council of <a href="13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> in 359, in which the <a href="13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> party was triumphant. Acacius was deposed and St. Cyril seems to have returned to his <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. But the emperor was displeased at the turn of events, and, in 360, Cyril and other moderates were again driven out, and only returned at the accession of <a href="08558b.htm">Julian</a> in 361. In 367 a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="15253b.htm">Valens</a> banished all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been restored by <a href="08558b.htm">Julian</a>, and Cyril remained in exile until the death of the persecutor in 378. In 380, <a href="07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> came to Jerusalem on the recommendation of a council held at Antioch in the preceding year. He found the Faith in accord with the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, but the city a prey to parties and corrupt in <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>. St. Cyril attended the great Council of Constantinople in 381, at which <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> had ordered the Nicene <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, now a law of the empire, to be <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. St. Cyril then formally accepted the <em><a href="07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em>; <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> call this an act of repentance. <a href="14118b.htm">Socrates</a> gives 385 for St. Cyril's death, but <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> tells us that St. Cyril lived eight years under <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, that is, from January 379.</p>

<h2>Writings</h2>

<p>The extant works of St. Cyril of Jerusalem include a sermon on the Pool of Bethesda, a letter to the Emperor Constantius, three small fragments, and the famous "Catecheses". The letter describes a wonderful cross of light, extending from Calvary to the Mount of Olives, which appeared in the air on the nones of May, after Pentecost, toward the beginning of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> episcopate. The <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> lectures are among the most precious remains of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity. They include an introductory address, eighteen instructions delivered in <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> to those who were preparing for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and five "mystagogical" instructions given during <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> week to the same <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> after their <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>. They contain interesting local references as to the finding of the Cross, the position of Calvary in relation to the walls, to the other holy places, and to the great basilica built by Constantine in which these conferences were delivered. They seem to have been spoken extempore, and written down afterwards. The style is admirably clear, dignified, and <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a>; the tone is serious and full of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. The subject is thus divided: 1. Hortatory. 2. On <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, and confidence in <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> pardon. 3. On <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, how water receives the power of sanctifying: as it cleanses the body, so the Spirit seals the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. 4. An abridged account of the Faith. 5. On the nature of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. 6-18. On the Creed: 6. On the monarchy of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and the various <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> which deny it. 7. On the Father. 8. His <a href="11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>. 9. The Creator. 10. On the <a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>. 11. His Eternal Sonship. 12. His virgin birth. 13. His <a href="11527b.htm">Passion</a>. 14. His <a href="12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and <a href="01767a.htm">Ascension</a>. 15. His second coming. 16-17. On the Holy Ghost. 18. On the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The first mystagogical <em>catechesis</em> explains the renunciations of <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a>, etc. which preceded <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>; the second is on the effects of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the third on confirmation, the fourth on <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, and the fifth on <a href="10006a.htm">holy Mass</a> for the living and the dead. The hearers are told to observe the <em><a href="05032a.htm">disciplina arcani</a></em>; <em>Rom.</em> they must repeat nothing to <a href="11388a.htm">heathens</a> and <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>; the book also has a note to the same effect.</p>

<p>A few points may be noted. The mythical origin of the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> is told, and the story of the phoenix, so popular from Clement onwards. The description of Mass speaks of the mystical washing of the <a href="12406a.htm">priest's</a> hands, the <a href="11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>, the "Sursum Corda", etc., and the Preface with its mention of the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, the Sanctus, the <a href="05502a.htm">Epiclesis</a>, the transmutation of the elements by the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the whole Church and for the spirits of the departed, followed by the <a href="09356a.htm">Paternoster</a>, which is briefly explained. Then come the "Sancta Sanctis" and the Communion. "Approaching do not come with thy palms stretched flat nor with fingers separated. But making thy left hand a seat for thy right, and hollowing thy palm, receive the Body of Christ, responding <a href="01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And having with care hallowed thine eyes by the touch of the Holy Body, take it, vigilant lest thou drop any of it. For shouldst thou lose any of it, it is as though thou wast deprived of a member of thy own body." "Then after Communion of the Body of Christ, approach the Chalice of His Blood, not extending thy hands, but bending low, and with adoration and reverence saying <a href="01407b.htm">Amen</a>, sanctify thyself by receiving also the Blood of Christ. And while thy lips are yet wet, touch them with thy hands, and sanctify thy eyes and thy forehead and thy other senses" (Cat. Myst., v, 22, 21-22). We are to make the <a href="13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> when we eat and drink, sit, go to bed, get up, talk, walk, in short, in every action (Cat. iv, 14). Again: "if thou should be in foreign cities, do not simply ask where is the church (<em>kyriakon</em>), for the <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the impious try to call their caves <em>kyriaka</em>, nor simply where is the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (<em>ekklesia</em>), but where is the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, for this is the proper name of this holy Mother of all" (Cat. xviii, 26).</p>

<h2>Doctrine</h2>

<p>St. Cyril's <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is expressed in his creed, which seems to have run thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>I <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father Almighty, Creator of <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and earth and of all things visible and invisible. And in one <a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the only-begotten <a href="14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, begotten by the Father <a href="06608a.htm">true God</a> before all ages, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, Life of Life, Light of Light, by Whom all things were made. Who <em>for us men and for our <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a></em> came down, and was incarnate <em>by the Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mary</em>, and was made man. He was crucified . . . and buried. He rose again on the third day according to the Scriptures, and sat at the right hand of the Father. And He cometh in glory to judge the living and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end. And in one Holy Ghost, the <a href="11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, Who spake by the <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and in one <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of repentance for the remission of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, and in one <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in the <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a>, and in life everlasting. </p></blockquote>

<p>The italicized words are uncertain. St. Cyril teaches the Divinity of the Son with perfect plainness, but avoids the word <a href="07449a.htm">"consubstantial"</a>, which he probably thought liable to misunderstanding. He never mentions <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, though he denounces the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> formula, "There was a time when the Son was not". He belonged to the <a href="13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a>, or <a href="01079b.htm">Homoean</a> party, and is content to declare that the Son is "in all things like the Father". He communicated freely with <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> such a Basil of <a href="01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> and <a href="05628b.htm">Eustathius of Sebaste</a>. He not only does not explain that the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> has one <a href="06608a.htm">Godhead</a>, but he does not even say the Three Persons are one <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. The one <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for him is always the Father. "There is one <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and one <a href="08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the only-begotten <a href="14142b.htm">Son of the only God</a>, and one Holy Ghost, Who sanctifies and deifies all things" (Cat. iv, 16). But he rightly says: "We do not divide the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> as some do, neither do we make a melting into one like Sabellius" (Cat. xvi, 4). Cyril never actually calls the Holy Ghost <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, but He is to be <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> together with the Father and the Son (Cat. iv, 16). There is therefore nothing incorrect in his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, only the explicit use of the Nicene formulae is wanting, and these, like St. Meletius and others of his party, he fully accepted at a later date.</p>

<p>St. Cyril's teaching about the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is of the first importance, for he was speaking freely, untrammelled by the <a href="05032a.htm">"discipline of the secret"</a>. On the <a href="05573a.htm">Real Presence</a> he is unambiguous: "Since He Himself has declared and said of the bread: This is My Body, who shall dare to <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> any more? And when He asserts and says: This is My Blood, who shall ever hesitate and say it is not His Blood?" Of the Transformation, he argues, if Christ could change water into wine, can He not change wine into His own Blood? The <a href="01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="01358a.htm">wine</a> are symbols: "In the type of bread is given thee the Body, in the type of wine the Blood is given thee"; but they do not remain in their original condition, they have been changed, though the senses cannot tell us this: "Do not think it mere <a href="01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="01358a.htm">wine</a>, for it is the Body and Blood of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to the Lord's declaration". "Having learned this and being assured of it, that appears to be bread is not bread, though perceived by the taste, but the Body of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and what appears to be wine is not wine, though the taste says so, but the Blood of Christ . . . strengthen thy heart, partaking of it as spiritual (food), and rejoice the face of thy <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>". It is difficult not to see the whole <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> in these explicit words. Confirmation is with blessed <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a>: "As the bread of the Eucharist after the invocation of the Holy Ghost is not bread, but the Body of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so this holy myrrh is no longer simple, as one might say, after the invocation, but a gift of Christ and capable by the presence of the Holy Ghost of giving His divinity" (ii, 4). St. Peter and <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the heads (<em>prostatai</em>) of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Peter is <em>ho koryphaiotatos kai protostates ton apostolon</em>. The Faith is to be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> out of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. St. Cyril, as the <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> generally, gives the Hebrew canon of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> omitting the deutero-canonical books. But yet he often quotes them as Scripture. In the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> he does not acknowledge the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>There have been many editions of St. Cyril's works:--(Vienna, 1560); G. Morel (Paris, 1564); J. Pr&eacute;vot (Paris, 1608); T. Milles (London, 1703); the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> edition of <a href="15005a.htm">Dom Toutt&eacute;e</a> (Paris, 1720; reprinted at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1763); a new edition from <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, by G.C. Reischl, 8vo (Munich, 1848; 2nd vol. by J. Rupp, 1860); <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a> gives the Bened. ed. in P.G., XXXIII; Photius Alexandrides (2 vols., Jerusalem, 1867-8); Eng. tr. in Library of the Fathers (Oxford).</p>
