<p>Born in 1577, at Sigmaringen, <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, of which town his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> Johannes Rey was burgomaster; died at Sevis, 24 April, 1622. On the paternal side he was of <a href="06094b.htm">Flemish</a> ancestry. He pursued his studies at the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> in the Breisgau, and in 1604 became tutor to Wilhelm von Stotzingen, with whom he travelled in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In the process for Fidelis's <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> Wilhelm von Stotzingen bore witness to the severe <a href="10578b.htm">mortifications</a> his tutor practised on these journeys. In 1611 he returned to Freiburg to take the doctorate in canon and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>, and at once began to practise as an advocate. But the open corruption which found place in the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> courts determined him to relinquish that profession and to enter the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> the following year, and immediately afterwards was received into the <a href="06281a.htm">Order of Friars Minor</a> of the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin Reform</a> at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, taking the name of Fidelis. He has left an interesting memorial of his <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and of his spiritual development at that time in a book of spiritual exercises which he wrote for himself. This work was re-edited by Father Michael Hetzenauer, O.F.M. Cap., and republished in 1893 at Stuttgart under the title: "S. Fidelis a Sigmaringen exercitia seraphicae devotionis". From the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> he was sent to <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> to finish his studies in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> under Father John Baptist, a Polish friar of great repute for learning and <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a>. At the conclusion of his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies Fidelis was appointed guardian first of the community at Rheinfelden, and afterwards at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> and Feldkirch. As a preacher his burning <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> earned for him a great reputation.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From the beginning of his apostolic career he was untiring in his efforts to convert <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> nor did he confine his efforts in this direction to the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, but also used his pen. He wrote many pamphlets against <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> and <a href="15772a.htm">Zwinglianism</a> though he would never put his name to his writings. Unfortunately these publications have long been lost. Fidelis was still guardian of the community at Feldkirch when in 1621 he was appointed to undertake a mission in the country of the Grisons with the purpose of bringing back that district to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The people there had almost all gone over to <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, owing partly to the <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and their lack of <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. In 1614 the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Coire had requested the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> to undertake missions amongst the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but it was not until 1621 that the general of the order was able to send <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> there. In that year Father Ignatius of Sergamo was commissioned with several other <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> to place himself at the disposal of this <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> for missionary work, and a similar commission was given to Fidelis who however still remained guardian of Feldkirche. Before setting out on this mission Fidelis was appointed by authority of the <a href="11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> to reform the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Pfafers. He entered upon his new labours in the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> apostolic spirit. Since he first entered the order he had constantly <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a>, as he confided to a fellow-friar, for two favours: one, that he might never fall into mortal <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>; the other, that he might die for the Faith. In this Spirit he now set out, ready to give his life in preaching the Faith. He took with him his crucifix, Bible, <a href="02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and the book of the rule of his order; for the rest, he went in absolute poverty, trusting to <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> for his daily sustenance. He arrived in Mayenfeld in time for <a href="01165a.htm">Advent</a> and began at once preaching and catechizing; often preaching in several places the same day. His coming aroused strong opposition and he was frequently threatened and insulted. He not only preached in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches and in the public streets, but occasionally in the conventicles of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. At Zizers one of the principal centres of his activity, he held conferences with the magistrates and chief townsmen, often far into the night. They resulted in the conversion of Rudolph de Salis, the most influential man in the town, whose public recantation was followed by many conversions.</p>

<p>Throughout the winter Fidelis laboured indefatigably and with such success that the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> preachers were seriously alarmed and set themselves to inflame the people against him by representing that his mission was political rather than religious and that he was preparing the way for the subjugation of the country by the Austrians. During the <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a> of 1622 he preached with especial fervour. At <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a> he returned to Feldkirch to attend a chapter of the order and settle some affairs of his community. By this time the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a> had been established in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Fidelis was formally constituted by the Congregation, superior of the mission in the Grisons. He had, however, a presentiment that his laborers would shortly be brought to a close by a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death. Preaching a farewell sermon at Feldkirch he said as much. On re-entering the country of the Grisons he was met everywhere with the cry: "Death to the <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>!" On 24 April, being then at Grusch, he made his confession and afterwards celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> and preached. Then he set out for Sevis. On the way his companions noticed that he was particularly cheerful. At Sevis he entered the church and began to preach, but was interrupted by a sudden tumult both within and without the church. Several Austrian soldiers who were guarding the doors of the church were killed and Fidelis himself was struck. A <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> present offered to lead him to a place of security. Fidelis thanked the man but said his life was in the hands of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Outside the church he was surrounded by a crowd led by the preachers who offered to save his life if he would <a href="01624b.htm">apostatize</a>. Fidelis replied: "I came to extirpate heresy, not to embrace it", whereupon he was struck down. He was the first <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> of the <a href="12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>. His body was afterwards taken to Feldkirch and buried in the church of his order, except his head and left arm, which were placed in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Coire. He was <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1729, and <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1745. St. Fidelis is usually represented in art with a crucifix and with a wound in the head; his emblem is a bludgeon. His <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 24 April.</p>
