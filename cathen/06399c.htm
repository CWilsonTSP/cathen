<p>(<a href="07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>'Azzah</em>, "the strong")</p>

<p>A <a href="08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Palaestina Prima, in the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarchate</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.</p>

<p>Gaza is one of the oldest cities in the world. Its first inhabitants were the Hevites (<a href="../bible/deu002.htm#vrs23">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). The Rephaim and the Enacim, expelled later by <a href="08524a.htm">Josue</a>, inhabited the surrounding mountains (<a href="../bible/jos011.htm#vrs22">Joshua 11:22</a>). The Hevites were driven forth by the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a> who came from Caphtor (D.V., Cappadocia; <a href="../bible/deu002.htm#vrs23">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>; <a href="../bible/amo009.htm#vrs7">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="../bible/jer047.htm#vrs4">Jeremiah 47:4</a>). Little else is known as to the origin of this warlike people, who occupied the whole Mediterranean coast between <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a> and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and whom the Hebrews could never wholly subdue. It is agreed, however, that they came from the southern coast of <a href="01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and the islands of the Aegean. Jeremias (xlvii, 4) speaks of the island of Caphtor, the isle of Cappadocia in <a href="05140a.htm">D.V.</a> According to Stephen of Byzantium ("De Urbibus," s.vv. Gaza, Minoa) the city of Gaza was a colony from Crete (cf. Soph., ii, 5). This statement is in accordance with the Biblical narrative which tells of reprisals made by the "Cerethi" (Cretans), a <a href="12021c.htm">Philistine</a> tribe. <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were established in the vicinity of Gaza as early as the time of Abraham; their leader, Abimelech, who bore the title of king, resided at Gerara (<a href="../bible/gen021.htm#vrs33">Genesis 21:33</a>; <a href="../bible/gen026.htm#vrs1">26:1</a>). Some critics, however, hold that the title of "King of the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a>" was given to Abimelech, not because he was himself a <a href="12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, but because he dwelt in the country afterwards inhabited by that people. In any case the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a> certainly possessed Gaza when Moses and the Hebrews arrived in the Holy Land. Though it was assigned to the tribe of Juda, the city could never be conquered by Josue on account of its high wall (<a href="../bible/gen015.htm#vrs18">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="../bible/jos015.htm#vrs47">Joshua 15:47</a>; <a href="../bible/amo001.htm#vrs7">Amos 1:7</a>). The tribe of Juda possessed the city by right but not in fact.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Gaza appears to have been the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the five satrapies which formed the territory of the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a>; and like the four other cities, <a href="01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, Accaron, Azotus, and Geth, it had a king whose power extended to all the cities and villages of the region. Samson, to escape from the hands of the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, bore the gates of the city away on his shoulders during the night to the neighbouring mountain (<a href="../bible/jdg016.htm#vrs3">Judges 16:3</a>); it was at Gaza that, blind and a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, he pulled down the temple of <a href="04602c.htm">Dagon</a> on himself and his enemies (Judges xvi, 21-30). <a href="04602c.htm">Dagon</a> was not the special deity of Gaza. He is to be met with also at <a href="01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, Azotus, and the other <a href="12021c.htm">Philistine</a> cities to which the term "Beth-dagon" is applied. To a certain extent the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a> had transformed into a national deity this god of Assyrian origin, a monster in part the shape of a fish, in part also, the form of a man. The <a href="08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, who had captured Gaza before the time of Samson (<a href="../bible/jdg001.htm#vrs18">Judges 1:18</a>), were still in possession of it in the time of Solomon (<a href="../bible/1ki004.htm#vrs24">1 Kings 4:24</a>). It is probable, however, that at this later date the city merely paid tribute, retaining its autonomy.</p>

<p>The people of Gaza continued to manifest their <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and carried on a brisk commerce in Jewish slaves (<a href="../bible/amo001.htm#vrs6">Amos 1:6</a>), which drew upon them the terrible maledictions of the <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a> (<a href="../bible/amo001.htm#vrs6">Amos 1:6-7</a>, <a href="../bible/zec009.htm#vrs5">Zechariah 9:5</a>; <a href="../bible/jer025.htm#vrs20">Jeremiah 25:20</a>; <a href="../bible/jer047.htm#vrs5">47:5</a>). The evils foretold began when the rulers of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and those of <a href="02007c.htm">Assyria</a> or Chaldea engaged in their long and eventful struggle for the domination of <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a> and world-supremacy. Being on the great highway of the conquering armies, Gaza was destined to special suffering. About 734 B.C., Theglathphalasar III numbered among his vassals Hanon, the King of Gaza, who had joined Rasin and Phacee, Kings of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in revolt against the Assyrian monarch. On the approach of the <a href="02007c.htm">Assyrian</a> army Hanon fled to <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the city was taken and sacked. But the victors had scarcely departed when Hanon returned to Gaza; and in 720 B.C. we find him on the battlefield of Raphia, among the allies of <a href="11788c.htm">Pharao</a> Shabaka, where he was defeated and taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Shortly after this the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a> of Gaza were defeated by Ezechias, King of Juda (<a href="../bible/2ki018.htm#vrs8">2 Kings 18:8</a>), and were forced to revolt with him against the <a href="02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>; the latter, however, returned and again compelled the <a href="12021c.htm">Philistines</a> to submit. Asarhaddon and Assurbanipal numbered among their tributaries Tsilbel, King of Gaza. When the Assyrian empire had been destroyed <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> sought to enrich itself from the spoils, and <a href="11788c.htm">Pharao</a> Necho II captured Gaza (<a href="../bible/jer047.htm#vrs1">Jeremiah 47:1</a>; Herodotus II, clix) on his way towards Carchemish, where he was defeated by the Babylonians, who, under the leadership of <a href="10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> (Nebuchadnezzar), took the offensive and recaptured Gaza. The city was especially ill-treated, and had afterwards to pay tribute to King Nabonides for the building of the great temple of Sin at Haran. Later the Babylonians gave way to the <a href="11712a.htm">Persians</a>. Cambyses, on the occasion of his expedition to <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in 525 B.C., besieged Gaza, which alone dared to resist his march (Polybius, XVI, 40). It submitted, nevertheless, and under the Persian dominion, according to Herodotus (III, xv), who compares it to Sardis, one of the most beautiful cities of <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>, it enjoyed great prosperity. The people of Gaza, who seem to have been very <a href="06147a.htm">courageous</a> and very loyal to their masters, whoever they might be, refused to open the gates to the army of Alexander the Great (332 B.C.). He was forced to begin a regular siege, which lasted two months and cost him many men. After storming the city, Alexander laid waste to Gaza, put the men to the sword, and sold the <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> and children into slavery. He afterwards allowed the place to be re-colonized; but the new-comers were of a different stock from the old inhabitants. The <a href="12021c.htm">Philistine</a> stronghold made way for an Hellenic city (Diodorus Siculus, XVII, xlviii, 7; Arrian, II, xxxvi; Quintus Curtius, IV, xxxiii). Henceforth there is little peace for Gaza. For several centuries it was the battlefield for <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, and Jewish armies. It was taken three times by Ptolemy I, King of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (320, 312, and 302 B.C.), and twice by Antigonus (315 and 306 B.C.). Finally it fell to the Lagidae, who retained it for almost a century. In 219 B.C. Antiochus of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> took possession of it, and organized there the invasion of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; but he was defeated at Raphia in 217 B.C., and compelled to abandon his conquest to the Egyptians. In 198 B.C. he again took Gaza, routed the Egyptians in the following year, and this time was able to retain his conquest. Jonathan Machabeus appeared with his army before Gaza, which refused to open its gates, so the suburbs were burnt, and the inhabitants compelled to give hostages, 145-143 B.C. (<a href="../bible/1ma011.htm#vrs60">1 Maccabees 11:60-62</a>).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Alexander Jannaeus besieged the city for a whole year (98 B.C.) and finally captured it, through treachery, sacked it and slew a large number of the inhabitants (Josephus, "Ant. Jud., " XIII, xiii, 3; "Bel. Jud., " I, iv, 2). It was rebuilt later by Pompey and by Gabinius (Josephus, "Ant. Jud., " XIV, iv, 4; Appian, "Syr., " 51). Anthony ceded to Cleopatra the whole of the Mediterranean coast between <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenicia</a>, and <a href="02107a.htm">Augustus</a> gave Gaza to <a href="07289c.htm">Herod the Great</a> (30 B.C.). At <a href="07289c.htm">Herod's</a> death it became subject to the governor of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>. In A.D. 66 the revolted <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a> sacked the city, which was of course soon recaptured by the Romans (Josephus, "Bel. Jud., " II, xviii, 1). The era of Gaza, found on its <a href="11152a.htm">coins</a> and on numerous <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="08042a.htm">Christian inscriptions</a>, dates from a journey of Pompey through Palestine, 28 October, 61 B.C. Gaza is mentioned only once in the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs26">Acts 8:26</a>), in connection with the route followed by the eunuch of <a href="03244c.htm">Queen Candace</a>. The Hellenistic city had transformed its Oriental <a href="04683a.htm">deities</a> into Graeco-Roman gods, and was long hostile to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which as late as the first quarter of the fourth century had scarcely secured a foothold there. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that Philemon, to whom <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> addressed an epistle, is spoken of as its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but this is merely an unreliable tradition. St. Sylvanus, its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a> (310) at the mines of Phaeno, is called "bishop of the churches about Gaza" (<a href="05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250108.htm"><em>Church History</em> VIII.13</a>; "De Mart. Palaest.," xiii, iv); Asclepas, his successor, is also called "<a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the churches about Gaza." He assisted at the <a href="11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> in 325, and was one of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> most feared by the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>. He is always found among those who suffered the most severely in the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> conflict, with men like <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, <a href="09642a.htm">Marcellus of Ancyra</a>, and others of that type.</p>

<p><a href="04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> forcibly introduced <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into Gaza, but such was the hostility of the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> population that Bishop Asclepas deemed it prudent to build the church outside the city. Near the church, but likewise without the walls, arose later the oratory of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Timothy; in the same place were <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> St. Major and St. Thea. <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, however, spread rapidly in Majuma, the port of Gaza, between two and three miles from the city and owing dependence to it. The citizens of the port obtained from Constantine the privilege of municipal independence for their city, under the name of <a href="04294a.htm">Constantia</a>, with the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to have its own <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. When, later, <a href="08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> withdrew <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> from Majuma, it still retained its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the most famous of whom were Peter the Iberian, a <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> ascetic, and St. Cosmas, foster brother and friend of <a href="08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>. In the neighbouring cities, e.g. Anthedon, Bethelia, and Menois, <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was also introduced with difficulty. Under <a href="08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> three brothers, Eusebius, Nestabos, and Zeno, were <a href="12565a.htm">put to death</a> at Gaza by the populace. <a href="07347a.htm">St. Hilarion</a>, born in the neighbouring Thabatha, a small village, was compelled to flee to <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> to escape <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> by the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> (<a href="14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, <a href="../fathers/26025.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.9</a>; Greg. Naz., "Invect. I in Jul., " 66-67). The first church built in Gaza itself was the work of St. Irenion (d. 393) whose <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is 16 December. He was succeeded by Aeneas, and later by St. Porphyry (395-420), the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> restorer of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Gaza. This <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> first sent Marcus, his <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> and historian, to Constantinople to obtain an order to close the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a>. The <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> then scarcely numbered 200 in Gaza; though the rest of the empire was gradually abandoning its idols, Gaza was stubborn in its opposition to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> was granted by the emperor, and the <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> closed, with the exception of the Marneion, the temple sacred to Zeus Marnas, which had replaced that of <a href="04602c.htm">Dagon</a>. There was no great change, however, in the sentiments of the people; so St. Porphyry decided to strike a decisive blow. He went himself to Constantinople during the winter of 401-402 and obtained from Arcadius a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> for the destruction of the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a>, which Cynegius, a special imperial envoy, executed in May, 402. Eight <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a>, those of Aphrodite, Hecate, the Sun, Apollo, Core, Fortune, the Heroeion, and even the Marneion, were either pulled down or burnt. Simultaneously soldiers visited every house, seizing and burning the idols and books of magic. On the ruins of the Marneion was erected, at the expense of the empress, a large church called the Eudoxiana in her <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, and dedicated 14 April, 407. <a href="11388a.htm">Paganism</a> had thus ceased to exist officially.</p>

<p>Gaza, now a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> city, became rich and prosperous; and during the fifth and sixth centuries was the seat of a famous <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> rhetoricians. Monasticism also flourished there; and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> recognizes as <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> many religious of Gaza, e.g. Dorotheus, Dositheus, Barsanuphius, and John the Prophet; the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were also, for a time, actively engaged in its environs. At the <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a> invasion, about 637, the city fell before General Amr. The Eudoxiana was converted into a mosque, and the Roman garrison, consisting of sixty soldiers under the command of <a href="03183b.htm">Callinicus</a>, having refused to <a href="01624b.htm">apostatize</a>, was slain at <a href="05380a.htm">Eleutheropolis</a> and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> ("Analecta Bollandiana," XXIII, 289-307; "Echos d' Orient," VIII, 1905, 40-43). The <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> venerate the city as the burial-place of Hachem, the grandfather of <a href="10424a.htm">Mahomet</a>. When the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> came, Gaza was almost in ruins; owing, however, to its situation on the way from <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, it soon regained prosperity. Baldwin III built a fortress there (1149) and confided it to the <a href="14493a.htm">Templars</a>. Saladin pillaged the city in 1170, but the fortress did not fall until 1187. <a href="13041b.htm">Richard the Lionhearted</a> held it for a brief time. In 1244 the combined forces of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> were defeated by the Kharezmians. The <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> finally took Gaza in 1516; and in 1799 <a href="10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a> held it for a few days. It is now known as Ghazzeh, and is a kaimakamat in the sandjak of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It numbers over 40,000 inhabitants, nearly all <a href="10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. There are only 1000 <a href="11329a.htm">Greek schismatics</a>, 150 <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 50 <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and 150 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The latter have a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> under the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> contains the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Porphyry. Mosques are very numerous, among the most remarkable being Djamia-el-Kebir, the ancient <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, dedicated to <a href="08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>; also Nebi-Hachem, in which is the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the grandfather of <a href="10424a.htm">Mahomet</a>. The city is unclean, and its streets narrow and crooked. But seen from a distance, amid its surrounding vegetation, it appears magnificent. The entire district is well irrigated and cultivated; the soil is extremely rich, and the trade of the city rather prosperous.</p>
