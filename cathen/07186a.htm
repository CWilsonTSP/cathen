<p>Missionary, author, founder of the <a href="11587c.htm">Paulists</a>; b. in New York, 18 December, 1819; d. there, 22 Dec., 1888. His <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> were John Hecker, a native of Wetzlar, and Caroline Freund, of Elberfeld, <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. John Hecker professed no religious <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>; his wife, who had originally been a <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, became an ardent <a href="10237b.htm">Methodist</a>; none of the three children, all boys, ever joined any of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>. A reverse in the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> fortune made it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Isaac, who was the youngest of the sons, to begin work at the age of eleven, helping his elder brothers in their business as bakers. His consequent want of even a complete common-school <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> would have been a serious and permanent impediment to any future <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> work had he not been a studious, thoughtful boy, instinctively eager for <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Even while kneading the dough in the bakery he studied <a href="08603a.htm">Kant's</a> "Critique of Pure Reason", which he had fixed conveniently before his eyes. His mind was original, <a href="08082b.htm">intuitive</a>, and prone to seek the hidden solution of the grave problems of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and of life. As a lad, he was anxious to improve the social condition of American workingmen. While still in his early teens he was accustomed to make street speeches on politico-social topics, and before he became of age, he was a friend and correspondent of <a href="03001a.htm">Orestes A. Brownson</a>, who was already famous as a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and social reformer. Along with his keen sense for practical affairs, young Hecker was then, as always, predominantly mystical, and of a profoundly religious temperament. Perhaps because his religious sentiments were instinctively <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, he was repelled by the teachings of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. Their doctrines of the total depravity of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> and of the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> sinfulness of reason were especially repugnant to him. On the other hand, becoming acquainted with the Transcendentalists, he found that they overexalted <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>. Driven from both extremes he sought religious <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> restlessly until he became convinced of the Divinity of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. He was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Bishop McCloskey, in New York January, 1844. Once within the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, he was powerfully attracted by the ideal of <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> in community, while his ever-increasing consciousness of a <a href="15498a.htm">vocation</a> to help his fellow-men drew him towards the apostolic <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. To satisfy both demands of his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, he applied for admission into the <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> community. He entered their <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> in 1845.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The period of preparation and study thus begun was one of acute suffering to him, and of perplexity to his superiors. His native bent was towards philosophy and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and he had from his boyhood informally exercised himself in these studies; but when he came to the formal study of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> he was halted and tortured by an inexplicable obscuration of the mind. However, in spite of the fears and <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> of some who did not understand him, he was recommended for <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="15670a.htm">Bishop Wiseman</a>. After spending one year as a <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, he returned to New York in March, 1851, as one of a band of <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> missionaries assigned to work in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. The tide of immigration was then at its height, and for years Father Hecker and his four companions, Fathers Walworth, <a href="07309b.htm">Hewit</a>, Deshon, and <a href="02213a.htm">Baker</a>, were engaged in continuous and very arduous labours amid the rapidly increasing <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. Father Hecker was deficient, at first, in some of the niceties of elocution, and he was never remarkable for those surges of emotion and <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> that are usually associated with oratorical power, but he was unrivalled as an instructor, persuasive in the highest degree, earnest, humorous, and apt in illustration; and he soon developed into a forceful, intense, and magnetic public speaker. He was much in demand as a lecturer and exponent of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and for years he was eagerly welcomed by overflowing audiences in New York, <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, St. Louis, <a href="03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and other large cities. The novelty of the lectures and the <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> of the lecturer, as well as his skill in presenting <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and historical themes, assured his success in the career for which he had long <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> and laboured. He became an apostle primarily to the <a href="06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and then to those of the household of the Faith.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a misunderstanding had arisen between the American <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> and their superiors. In order to seek an final and authoritative settlement of the difficulty, Father Hecker went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the representative of the American Fathers, to lay their case before the superior general of the order. Upon his arrival, he found the general and his council extremely hostile, and on the third day he was expelled from the order. <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> dispensed Hecker and his four companions from their <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> as <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, and authorized and encouraged them to form a new congregation devoted to missionary work in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> in dependence upon the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> was chosen patron of the new institute, which is called legally "The Missionary Society of St. Paul the Apostle in the State of New York". Father Hecker was elected superior of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, and so continued until his death. He worked, during the prime of his life, with immense energy. In addition to his <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> as superior, he continued his work as a lecturer; he notably promoted the apostolate of the press among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in America; he organized the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Publication Society, founded and edited "The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> World" magazine, directed "The Young Catholic", a paper for children, and created a new movement in <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literary activities. He was the author of three books: "Questions of the Soul", "The Aspirations of Nature", "The <a href="02081a.htm">Church</a> and the Age". However varied his works, his object in view was always simple: the propagation of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>.</p>

<p>Father Hecker's work has been likened to <a href="10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman's</a>, by the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> himself&mdash;"I have ever felt", <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> wrote to <a href="07309b.htm">Father Hewit</a> on the occasion of Father Hecker's death, "that there was a sort of unity in our lives, that we had both begun a work of the same kind, he in America and I in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>". In spite of some obvious differences in the character of the two men and of their work, the comparison is justifiable. <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a>, better than anyone else, it has been said, made <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and practices acceptable to the English mind, which had long been estranged from <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> on the pretence that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was a foreign institution. Hecker, a man of and from the people, strove unceasingly to recommend the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> to the democratic American people, who had been reared in hostility to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> on the pretence that she was foreign and anti-democratic. He was an ardent American, in <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> with American institutions, but he was likewise absolutely and uncompromisingly <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. He won the respect and confidence of his non-Catholic countrymen to a surprising extent, while at the same time eliciting repeated letters of approval from the highest authorities of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The regrettable controversy on "Americanism", in which Father Hecker's name was mentioned, is discussed elsewhere in this book (see <a href="14537a.htm">TESTEM BENEVOLENTI&AElig;</a>). It suffices to say here that, on the occasion of the issue, by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, of the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Testem Benevolenti&aelig;", the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> all but unanimously gave spontaneous testimony that Father Hecker had never countenanced any deviation form, or minimizing of, <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a>. And it is quite generally recognized by American <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> that among the notable champions of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the nineteenth century none was more loyal, none spent himself more generously, than Father Hecker, in upholding its dignity and extending its sway.</p>
