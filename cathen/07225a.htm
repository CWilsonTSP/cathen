<p>King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and Navarre, son of Jeanne d'Albret and Antoine* de Bourbon, b. 14 December, 1553, in the castle of Pau; d. 14 May, 1610. He began his military career under Admiral de Coligny and, from 1569, played a decisive part in the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion as head of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party. By the death of the Duke of Anjou, in 1584, Henry of Bourbon became heir-presumptive to the crown of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The manifesto of P&eacute;rrone (March, 1585) issued by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes gave <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of their uneasiness: Cardinal de Pellev&eacute; and the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Claude Mathieu expressed their anxiety at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Although <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, a strong supporter of royal authority, was not in complete sympathy with the programme and the action of the League, yet relying on the public right which in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> had been acknowledged in the whole of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, he took decisive measures against Henry of Bourbon. Wishing <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to have a king who was respected and hostile to <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, he declared that Henry of Bourbon had forfeited his <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> to the throne of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, deprived him of the crown of <a href="10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, and released his subjects from their <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity (9 September, 1585). The parliamentarians and the Gallican lawyers protested. Hofmann published his "Brutum fulmen Pape Sixti V" in answer to the <a href="03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>. Henry of Bourbon appealed to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, through his letters to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the nobility (1 January, 1586); he attempted to gain the support of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and resolved to try the fortune of arms. For the account of the circumstances and the military events that assured the throne to Henry of Bourbon see <a href="07074a.htm">HOUSE OF GUISE</a>. To establish himself on the throne his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>; and the conversion of Henry IV is still an historical problem which must be examined in detail. A legend attributes to Henry IV the saying "Paris is well worth a Mass"; his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a>, then, would only have been a piece of policy devoid of all contrition. No contemporary document records this epigram, though the "Caquets de l'accouch&eacute;e", a satirical collection of the year 1622, speaks of Sully saying to Henry IV "Sire, Sire, la couronne vaut bien une messe", and these words, themselves <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, are probably the origin of the famous epigram so often attributed to the king. The opinion that the conversion of Henry IV was not sincere is refuted by the circumstances of his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a>, by the great interest Henry IV took in the so-called <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> colloquies between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and by his regarding it as a point of <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> to seek and find <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> reasons before carrying out that religious change necessitated by political exigency.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>When, on 2 August, 1589, by the death of Henry III, Henry of Bourbon definitively inherited the royal crown, he had on his side the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, the <em>politiques,</em> who belonged mainly to parliamentary and Gallican circles, and finally many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who entreated him to become a member of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; against him he had the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a> and the League supported by <a href="12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> and <a href="07004a.htm">Pope Gregory XIV</a>. Among the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who stood by Henry of Bourbon, a certain number, from 1591 to 1593, seeing that he took no steps to be instructed in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, began to form a <em>tiers parti,</em> who were in favour of selecting as king the young Cardinal Charles de Bourbon, second son of Louis I, Prince of Cond&eacute;. Not having received <a href="11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, Charles could have married. By the spring of 1593 the more moderate members of the League, fearing the influence of Philip II on French affairs, were in agreement with the <em>tiers parti</em> to elect a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bourbon, that is to say, Henry of Bourbon, if he would be converted, or, if he would not, Cardinal Charles de Bourbon. Henry IV had declared on several occasions that he would never embrace <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> for merely political reasons. "Religion is not changed as easily as a shirt", he wrote in 1583. "It would be setting very little value on either religion", said Villeroy, Henry's representative, in 1592, "to promise a change before being instructed and well-informed." From March, 1592, Henry IV had an intimate friend in Jacques Davy Duperron, a convert from <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, later a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> and a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and the conversations with Duperron had a great influence on his mind. The <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conference at Mantes (April, 1593) in which, for seven consecutive days, Duperron argued with four <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a> as to whether the whole <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> is contained in the <a href="../bible.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, ended in the defeat of the <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>. One of them, Palma Gayet, who had been Henry of Bourbon's tutor, carried away from the discussion the germs of his own conversion to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>. At the same time Sully, although he was a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, told Henry IV that the means of <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> through Christ were to be found in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> as well as in the Reformed Church, and he urged him to become a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in order to win the <em>tiers parti</em> over definitively. Henry IV announced to the Grand Duke of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> on 26 April, 1593, and to the Prince de Conti on 10 May, 1593, his coming submission to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; on 16 May the royal council pronounced in favour of the conversion. In the beginning of June Henry IV assisted at Mantes at another discussion on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, in which Duperron, who had just been named <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="05671a.htm">Evreux</a>, again vanquished two <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>; then on 22 July he went to <a href="13344a.htm">Saint-Denis</a>, where a score of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> awaited him. The following morning he had a conference with Duperron, with the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, and with the Bishops of <a href="09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> and <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>; he questioned them on three points that were not yet clear to him&mdash;the veneration of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, auricular confession, and the authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The discussion lasted five hours. That afternoon, after a lengthy discussion, Henry signed a formula of adhesion to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and a special promise of obedience to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. On 26 July he renewed his declaration before the assembled <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>; and on 25 July, amidst great pomp, <a href="02376c.htm">Renaud de Beaune de Semblan&#231;ay</a>, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a> and Grand Almoner of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, received his <a href="01044d.htm">abjuration</a> at the door of the basilica of Saint-Denis, and then heard his confession. The <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> of the people was unbounded.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But it was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have the situation regularized by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which had formerly <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Henry of Bourbon. An officer of the king's household, La Clielle, was dispatched to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in September to announce to <a href="04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> that Louis de Gonzague, Duke of <a href="10778a.htm">Nevers</a>, would soon arrive with a solemn embassy to offer the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> the obedience of Henry IV. Cardinal Toledo informed La Clielle, in the name of <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, that it was first <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Henry to do penance and be absolved from the crime of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and that the embassy would not be received for the time being. In fact, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="12317a.htm">Possevino</a>, was sent to meet it and to forbid it to come to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, though Nevers was permitted to enter the city alone, and even then, not as an ambassador, but as a private individual; between 21 November, 1593, and 14 January, 1594, he had five audiences with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, but obtained nothing, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> refusing even to receive three of the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, then in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who had taken part in the ceremonies at <a href="13343b.htm">Saint-Denis</a>. In February, 1594, Cardinal de Plaisance, <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, learning that Henry IV was to be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a> on 27 February, informed the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> that he would not be absolved. This caused a great sensation in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and soon Cardinal de Plaisance began to fear that a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> like that of <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> was imminent. Cardinal de Gondi, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, finally won (May, 1584) the consent of <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> to enter in to negotiations with Henry IV. Henry first charged Arnaud d'Ossat, a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> living in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with the preliminary secret negotiations. The <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> first contended that Henry required not only <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>, but rehabilitation, which would render him capable of being recognized as a legitimate sovereign; d'Ossat, little by little, won some concessions. But the measures taken by the Parlement of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> against the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in January, 1595, after the attempt of Jean Chastel on the life of Henry IV, were exploited at the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> court by the ambassador of Philip II; and <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> seemed, for a time, decided to make the recall of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> the condition <em>sine qua non</em> of the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> of Henry. It was a <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Alexandre Georges, who, being presented to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by Father Acquaviva, general of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a>, represented to <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> that the public weal demanded a prompt reconciliation between the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Clement allowed himself to be persuaded, and on 12 July, 1595, Duperron, the official ambassador of Henry, arrived in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to settle the conditions of <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a>. <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> did not confirm purely and simply the <a href="01061a.htm">absolution</a> pronounced at Saint- Denis, but took another course, and on 17 September, 1595, in the portico of St. Peter's, solemnly declared the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> free from all <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. This moral triumph was followed by the victory of Fontaine Fran&#231;aise (1595) which gave <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to Henry IV, by the capture of <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a> which gave him Picardy, by the defection of the Duke of Merc&aelig;ur which put him in possession of Brittany, and by the Treaty of Vervins, concluded in 1598 with Philip II. On the dissolution of his marriage with Margaret of Valois, sister of Charles IX, by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in 1599, he married Marie de Medici (1600). This union resulted in an increase of French influence in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>

<p>Henry's foreign policy consisted in preserving peace to allow <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> time to strengthen her finances and her army; he negotiated with the Low Countries against <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and with the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> against the empire, but without going the length of open hostilities. His plan was to gather the weaker states around <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and unite against the Hapsburgs. Sully in his "Economies Royales" credits him with projecting a coalition of all the states of the empire against the Hapsburgs of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and with planning, on their downfall, a redivision of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> into fifteen states (six hereditary monarchies, six elective monarchies, and three republics), between which peace would be guaranteed by congresses of perpetual peace. It is now <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> that this pretended plan, called by many historians the <em>grand dessein</em> of Henry IV, was entirely the product of Sully's <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and that he amused himself in his old age with forging letters and stories wholesale to have the history of this "great design" believed.</p>

<p>The domestic policy of Henry IV was marked by an increased centralization of the royal authority and by great industrial, commercial, and agricultural prosperity, due in a large measure to the intelligent solicitude of Sully. <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> enjoyed a period of genuine religious peace during the last twelve years of Henry's reign. The Edict of Nantes (see <a href="06166a.htm">F<font size=-2>RANCE</font></a>, <a href="07527b.htm">H<font size=-2>UGUENOTS</font></a>) guaranteed security to the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> arose from the ruin caused by the long years of religious <a href="15546c.htm">warfare</a>. In the name of the <a href="01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a> in 1596, Claude d'Augennes de Rambouillet, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09143b.htm">Le Mans</a>, complained to Henry IV of the appointment of unworthy candidates and of children to abbacies and <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. Henry promised to give the matter his attention; he nominated d'Ossat <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and tried to induce <a href="06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> to settle in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. But the abuses continued, when it suited the whims of the king; he appointed one of his <a href="07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> sons <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a> at the age of six, and a child of four years of age <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lod&#232;ve. The reform of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was begun through the initiative of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and not by the influence of royalty. Henry IV, however, contributed towards it, owing to the influence of <a href="04422b.htm">P&#232;re Coton</a>, by favouring the work of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who, although they had been banished by a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Parlement of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, were left undisturbed in the districts under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Parlements of <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> and <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. The Edict of <a href="13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (1603) authorized them to remain in all places where they were established, and, further, to found colleges at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, and La Fl&#232;che, and in 1605 they were permitted to return to their Coll&#232;ge de Clermont at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>.</p>

<p>Henry IV, despite the efforts of d'Ossat and Duperron, did not dare, through fear of the reformers and the <em>parlementaires,</em> to allow the publication of the decrees of the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, but the researches of the Abb&eacute; Couzard with regard to the embassy of Philippe de B&eacute;thune, a younger brother of Sully, and a convert from <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (September, 1601-June, 1605) show that the relations of Henry towards the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were marked by a very cordial respect, frankness, and a conciliating attitude. The frivolity of Henry IV in his private life won for him the nickname <em>Vert galant</em>; the royal mistresses Gabrielle d'Estr&eacute;es and Henriette d'Entraigues are <a href="11126b.htm">notorious</a>. He was assassinated by Ravaillac on 14 May, 1610.</p>
