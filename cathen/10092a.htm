<p>Born either at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> or at Piscina in the Abruzzi, of a very old <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, 14 July, 1602; died at Vincennes, 9 March, 1661. His father was majordomo to the Colonna <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. One of his uncles, Giulio Mazarini (1544-1622), a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, enjoyed a great reputation in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, particularly at Bologna, as a preacher, and published several volumes of sacred eloquence.</p>

<p>His youth was full of excitement: he accompanied the future Cardinal Colonna to <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a>; he was in turn a captain of pontifical troops and then a pontifical diplomat in the Valtelline War (1624) and the Mantuan War of Succession (1628-30). The truce which he negotiated (26 October, 1630) between the French, on one side, and the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and the Duke of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, on the other, won for him the esteem of <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, who was well pleased at his letting Pignerol fall into the hands of the French. The <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> tried to injure him with <a href="15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a>, but the influence of Cardinal Antonio Barberini and a letter from <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> saved him. He became canon of St. John Lateran, vice-legate at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> (1632), and <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> extraordinary in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (1634). The <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> complained that in this last post Mazarin made it his exclusive business to support <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> policy, and he was dismissed from the nunciature by <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (17 Jan., 1636). Soon after leaving the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> service, he went to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, placed himself at <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> disposition, and was naturalized as a French subject in April, 1639. <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> commissioned him, late in 1640, to sign a secret treaty between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and Prince Thomas of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be made a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> on 16 Dec., 1641. Shortly before <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> death, Mazarin by a piece of clever management, had been able to effect the reoccupation of Sedan by French troops, and <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> on his deathbed (4 Dec., 1642) recommended him to the king. On the death of Louis XIII (14 May, 1642), Anne of Austria, leaving the Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans the shadowy title of lieutenant-general of the kingdom gave the reality of power to Mazarin, who first pretended to be on the point of setting out for <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and then pretended that his acceptance of office was only provisional, until such time as the peace of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> should be re-established.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But Mazarin, like <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, was, in the event, to retain power until his death, first under the queen regent and then under the king after <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> had attained his majority. His very <a href="07543b.htm">humble</a> appearance and manner, his gentle and kindly ways, had contributed to his elevation, and Anne's affection for him was the best guarantee of his continuance in office. The precise character of his relations with Anne of Austria is one of the enigmas of history. Certain letters of Anne of Austria to Mazarin, published by Cousin, and admissions made by Anne to Mme de Brienne and recorded in the Memoirs of Lom&eacute;nie de Brienne, prove that the queen regent was deeply attached to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Still, "my sensibilities have no part in it", she said to Mme de Brienne. Few historians give credence to Anne's assertion on this point, and some go so far as to accept the allegations of the Princess Palatine in her letters of 1717, 1718, and 1722, according to which Anne of Austria and Mazarin were married. M. Loiseleur, who has made a careful study of the problem, believes that Mazarin was never married; it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that he retained the title and insignia of a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> until his death; probably he was even a <a href="03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a>, though he never visited <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> after his elevation to the purple and seems never to have received the hat. And in any case he held the title of <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a> from 1653 to 1658.</p>

<p>Mazarin continued <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> policy against the House of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Aided by the victories of Cond&eacute; and Turenne, he succeeded in bringing the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> to a conclusion with the Treaties of Munster and Osnabr&uuml;ck (Treaty of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>), which gave Alsace (without Strasburg) to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; and in 1659 he ended the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the Peace of the Pyrenees, which gave to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> Roussillon, Cerdagne, and part of the Low Countries. Twice, in 1651 and 1652, he was driven out of the country by the Parliamentary Fronde and the Fronde of the Nobles, with the innumerable pamphlets (Mazarinades) which they published against him, but the final defeat of both Frondes was the victory of royal absolutism, and Mazarin thus prepared the way for <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV's</a> <a href="11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>. Lastly, in 1658, he placed <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, in some sort, under the young king's protection, by forming the League of the Rhine, which was destined to hold the House of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> in check. Thus did he lay the foundation of <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV's</a> greatness. His foreign policy was, as <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> had often been, indifferent to the interests of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>: the Peace of <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> gave its solemn sanction to the legal existence of <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and, while the <a href="11160a.htm">nuncio</a> vainly protested, <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes were rewarded with secularized <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and abbacies for their political opposition to <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Neither did it matter much to him whether the monarchical principle was respected or contemned in a foreign country: he was Cromwell's ally. Towards the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> he pursued an adroit policy. In 1654 Cromwell opened negotiations with the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> of the South of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, who, the year before, had taken up arms in Ardeche to secure certain liberties for themselves. Mazarin <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> how to keep the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> amused with fine words, promises, and calculated delays: for six years they believed themselves to be on the eve of recovering their privileges, and in the end they obtained nothing. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> well <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> how to retain in the king's service valuable <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> like Turenne and Gassion. His personal relations with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were hardly cordial. He could not prevent Cardinal Pamfili, a friend of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, from being elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (15 Sept., 1644) as <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>. He received in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, one after the other, Cardinals Antonio and Francesco Barberini, nephews of the late <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 21 February, 1646, fulminated by <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> against the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, who were absenting themselves without authorization, (by the tenor of which <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> Mazarin himself was bound to repair to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>), was voted by the Parliament of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> "null and abusive". Mazarin obtained a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Royal Council forbidding money to be remitted to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for expediting <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, there was a show of preparing an expedition against <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>, yielding to these menaces, ended by restoring their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> and dignities to Mazarin's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, the Barberini. Following up his policy of bullying the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, Mazarin sent two fleets to the <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> coast to seize the Spanish presidios nearest to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> frontiers. Apart from this, he had no Italian policy, properly speaking, and his demonstrations in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> had no other object than to compel <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> to keep her troops there, and to bring the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to a complaisant attitude towards <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and towards Mazarin's own relations. The elevation of his brother Michael Mazarin to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> (October, 1647) was one of his diplomatic victories. Though not interested in questions of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Mazarin detested the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> for the part taken by some of them &#151; disavowed, however, by Antoine* Arnauld &#151; in the Fronde, and for their support of Cardinal de Retz. A declaration of the king in July, 1653, and an assembly of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in May, 1655, over which Mazarin presided, gave executive force to the decrees of <a href="08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> against <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. The order condemning <a href="11511a.htm">Pascal's</a> "Provinciales" to be burnt, the order for the dismissal of pupils, <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>, and <a href="12319b.htm">postulants</a> from the two <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> of Port-Royal, the formula prepared by the <a href="01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a> against the "Augustinus" (1661), which formula all <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> had to sign &#151; all these must be regarded as episodes of Mazarin's anti-Jansenist policy. On his deathbed he warned the king "not to tolerate the <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, not even their name". Having little by little become "as powerful as God the Father when the world began", enjoying the revenues of twenty-seven abbacies, always ready to enrich himself by whatever means, and possessing a fortune equivalent to about $40,000,000 in twentieth century American money, Mazarin, towards the end of his life, multiplied in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> the manifestations of his wealth. He organized a free <a href="09366b.htm">lottery</a>, at his own expense, with prizes amounting to more than a million francs, collected in his own palace more wonderful things than the king's palace contained, had no objection to presiding at tournaments, exhibitions of horsemanship, and ballets, and patronized the earliest efforts of the comic poet <a href="10434b.htm">Moli&egrave;re</a>. The young <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> entertained a profound affection for him and, what is more, fell in <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> with the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> two nieces, Olympe Mancini and Marie Mancini, one after the other. Mazarin sent Marie away, to prevent the king from entertaining the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of marrying her. But if, for reasons of state, he refused to become the uncle of the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, it seems that there were moments when he dreamed of the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a>: the Abb&eacute; Choisy asserts that Mazarin died "in the vision of being made <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>". One reminiscence at least of the old political <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> is to be found in his will: he left the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> a fund (600,000 livres) to prosecute the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who throughout his life had given but little thought to the interests of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, seems to have sought pardon by remembering them on his deathbed. The same will directed the foundation of the College of the Four Nations, for the free <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of sixty children from those provinces which he had united to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. To this college he bequeathed the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> now known as the Biblioth&egrave;que Mazarine. Mazarin's nieces made princely marriages: Anne Marie Martinozzi became the Princesse de Conti; Laura Martinozzi, the Duchesse de Mod&egrave;ne; Laure Mancini died in 1657, Duchesse de Mercoeur; Olympe Mancini became Comtesse de <a href="14130c.htm">Soissons</a>; Hortense Mancini, Marquise de la Meilleraie and Duchesse de Mazarin; Marie Mancini, Countess Colonna; Marie Anne Mancini, Duchesse de Bouillon. All these <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, and particularly the last four, had singularly stormy careers.</p>
