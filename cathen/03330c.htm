<p>(CHARCOAL-BURNERS)</p>

<p>The name of a secret political <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, which played an important part, chiefly in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, during the first decades of the nineteenth century. The improbable claim was made that the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> originated some centuries earlier, and the French king <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a> appears in the secret documents of the Carbonari as one of their protectors. In reality the association originated as the eighteenth century passed into the nineteenth; it was one of the results of the political movement which accompanied the great <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and of the political principles that were proclaimed at that time. It is not certain whether the Carbonari, as a political <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, had its first organization in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> or <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. At any rate the power of the association was first shown at the beginning of the nineteenth century in the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> and the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. Just as the name "Carbonari" was adopted from the charcoal-burners, so also in their secret intercourse they made use of many expressions taken from the occupation of charcoal-burning. The place where the members assembled was called <em>baracca</em> (hut), its interior <em>vendita</em> (place of selling coal), and its surroundings <em>foresta</em> (forest). The members called one another <em>buon cugino</em> (good cousin); those not belonging to the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> were <em>pagani</em> (<a href="11388a.htm">heathens</a>). The Carbonari were divided into two classes: apprentices and masters. No apprentice could rise to the grade of a master before the end of six months. The members made themselves known to one another by secret signs in shaking hands. These signs for masters and apprentices were unlike. One of the underlying principles of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, was that the "good brotherhood" rested on religion and virtue; but by this was understood a purely natural conception of religion, and the mention of religion was absolutely forbidden. In reality the association was opposed to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nevertheless, it <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> <a href="14567b.htm">St. Theobald</a> as its <a href="11562a.htm">patron saint</a>. The members belonging to each separate district formed a <em>vendita</em>, called thus from the place of assembly. At the head was the <em>alta vendita</em>, to which deputies were chosen from the other <em>vendite</em>. A small hatchet was the distinguishing symbol of a master, the apprentices were indicated by a little fagot worn in the button-hole. Initiation into the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was accompanied by special ceremonies which, in the reception into the grade of master, imitated the Passion of Christ in a manner actually blasphemous. The members were bound by a frightful <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to observe absolute silence concerning whatever occurred in the vendita. The similarity between the <a href="14071b.htm">secret society</a> of the Carbonari and <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> is evident. <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> could enter the Carbonari as masters at once. The openly-avowed aim of the Carbonari was political: they sought to bring about a constitutional monarchy or a republic, and to defend the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the people against all forms of absolutism. They did not hesitate to compass their ends by assassination and armed revolt. As early as the first years of the nineteenth century the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was widespread in <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> territory, especially in the Abruzzi and Calabria. Not only men of low birth but also government officials of high rank, officers, and even members of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> belonged to it.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1814 the Carbonari resolved to obtain a constitution for the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> by force. The lawful ruler, Ferdinand I, was opposed to them, but the king placed on the throne by <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, Murat, connected himself with them in March, 1815, as he believed the time was come to create a united and independent <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. However, Murat was captured and shot in October of the same year and Ferdinand once more mounted the throne. In the following years the Carbonari grew in strength and power in all the districts of the <a href="10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> and made preparations for a new revolutionary movement. From <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> the Carbonari spread into the neighbouring territories of the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, and here also the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> sought to overthrow the absolute dominion of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The Carbonari even <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a forged <a href="03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> which contained an apparent confirmation of the association. On 15 August, 1814, <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> <a href="04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> and <a href="11380b.htm">Pacca</a> issued an edict against <a href="14071b.htm">secret societies</a>, especially against <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> and the Carbonari, in which all were forbidden under severe penalties to become members of these secret associations, to attend their meetings, or to furnish a meeting-place for such. Notwithstanding all this the propaganda of the Carbonari went on, chiefly in the district of <a href="09492a.htm">Macerata</a>, where an outbreak occurred, 25 June, 1817, which, however, was easily suppressed by the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> troops (cf. the important report, of Leggieri, Processo romano contro i congiurati di <a href="09492a.htm">Macerata</a> di 1817, ristretto presentato alla congregazione criminale, Rome, 1818).</p>

<p>When the Spanish revolution broke out in 1820, the <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> Carbonari once more took up arms, in order to wring a constitution from King Ferdinand I. They advanced against the capital from <a href="11089b.htm">Nola</a> under a military officer, Morelli, and the Abbot Minichini. They were joined by General Pepe and many officers and government officials, and the king on 13 July took an <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> to observe the Spanish constitution in <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> (cf. Pepe's defence of himself, Relation des evenements politiques et militaires qui ont eu lieu a <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a> en 1820 et 1821, Paris, 1822). The movement also spread to <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, and Victor Emmanuel resigned the throne in favour of his brother Charles Felix. It was only through the intervention of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, which sent troops to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, that the movement was crushed and the <a href="10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> constitution suppressed. The Carbonari, however, secretly continued their agitation against <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and the governments in friendly connection with it. They formed, even in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a <em>vendita</em>, published in the press the most violent accusations against the lawful rulers, and won over to their cause members of deposed sovereign <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>, among whom was Prince Louis, later <a href="10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>. <a href="12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> issued a general condemnation of the <a href="14071b.htm">secret society</a> of the Carbonari, 13 September, 1821. The association lost its influence by degrees and was gradually absorbed into the new political organizations that sprang up in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; its members became affiliated especially with Mazzini's "Young <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>". From <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> the organization was carried to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> where it appeared as the <em>Charbonnerie</em>, which, as in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was divided into <em>ventes</em>. Members were especially numerous in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was formed in 1821 by three young men named Bazard, Buchez, and Flotard. The chief aim of the association in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> also was political, namely, to obtain a constitution in which the conception of the sovereignty of the people could find expression. From <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> as a centre the Charbonnerie spread rapidly through the country, and by the end of the year 1821 it was the cause of several mutinies among the troops. The movement lost its importance after several conspirators had been executed, especially as quarrels broke out among the leaders. The Charbonnerie took part in the Revolution of July, 1830; after the fall of the Bourbons, however, its influence rapidly declined. After this a <em>Charbonnerie d&eacute;mocratique</em> was formed among the French Republicans, the aim of which was to obtain a republican constitution for the country; however, after 1841, nothing more was heard of it. Carbonari were also to be found in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, but their numbers and importance were more limited than in the other Romance countries.</p>
