<p>(IN PRUSSIA)</p>

<p>The sixteenth-century <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> accused the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of having adulterated the primitive purity of the Gospel by the admixture of un-Scriptural doctrines and practices; consequently they designated themselves as "Evangelicals", or followers of the pure Evangel, in contradistinction to the un-evangelical followers of Roman traditions and institutions.</p>

<p>Almost from the beginning the new Evangelical Church was split, first into two communions, the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and the Reformed, then into a multitude of <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> which baffles the skill of statisticians. The cleavage arose through differences in the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="05573a.htm">Christ's presence in the Holy Eucharist</a>. <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> taught the actual bodily presence of Christ in and with the elements, though denying <a href="05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>. <a href="15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> and the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> admitted only His spiritual presence. The <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and the Reformed Churches form the two great branches of Evangelical <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> to which all the other divisions of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> are subordinate. The evangelical section of the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> stands midway between the High Church and the Latitudinarian <a href="09399a.htm">Low Church</a>. As a proper name with strictly limited meaning the designation "Evangelical Church" applies to a branch of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, formed in 1817 at the instance of King Frederick William III of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, by a union of the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and the Reformed Churches.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> was at a low ebb. The <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> and Illuminism of the eighteenth century, openly encouraged by King <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (the Great), had told severely on the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life of the country, especially among the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The "rights of man", proclaimed and ruthlessly carried out by the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolutionists</a>, had found a welcome beyond the Rhine and well nigh superseded the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, whilst casting off the authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, had still bowed to that of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, and their followers adhered to several "Confessions of Faith" as binding on their <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>. These formul&aelig; were now overthrown as inimical to the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of free inquiry, as the work of men little versed in <a href="05692b.htm">exegesis</a> and history, as unscientific and un-Protestant. Religious life, thus deprived of its sap, was rapidly withering away. Indifference and infidelity obliterated the differences among <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> communities and threatened for a time to sweep away <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> itself.</p>

<p>The <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> State, owing its origin, growth, and importance to <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, was not sympathetic to its <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects. The Rhine Province, <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, and the Polish provinces were ever ready to manifest their affection for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and even of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The House of Hohenzollern was <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>, the majority of the nation was <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>. Frederick William III, King of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1797-1840), undertook to strengthen his rule and his country by building up a united religion together with a powerful army, efficient <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and a flourishing trade. As early as 1798 he had expressed the hope of uniting the Reformed and the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Churches by means of a common "Agenda", or ritual. He matured the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> on his visit to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1814, and made the first arrangement for a union and a new liturgy in St. James's Palace in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. It was proposed to celebrate in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> the third centennial jubilee of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and in anticipation of this festival he issued on 27 Sept., 1817, the memorable declaration that it was the royal wish to unite the separate <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and Reformed Confessions in his dominions into one Evangelical Christian Church, and that he would set an example in his own congregation at Potsdam by joining in a united celebration of the Lord's Supper at the approaching festival of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. It was not intended to fuse the Reformed Church into the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, or vice-versa, but to establish one Evangelical Church, quickened with the spirit of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The epithet <a href="12495a.htm">"Protestant"</a> was avoided as too partisan; prominence was given to the vague term <em>evangelical;</em> <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, whilst maintaining their own specific doctrines, were to form a single church under a single government and to present a united front to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>The execution of the royal plan was entrusted to the provincial consistories, <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, and <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> generally. The Synod of <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and nearly all the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> responded cordially to the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a>. External union, facilitated by the prevailing <a href="07759a.htm">religious indifference</a>, was adopted in Nassau and in the <a href="11415b.htm">Rhenish Palatinate</a> (1818), in Baden (1821), in Rhenish <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a> (1822), in <a href="15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> (1827). But Saxony, <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, and <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> proper were too exclusively <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, while <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> was too exclusively Reformed to join the Evangelical Church, and the Austrian <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> also divided their allegiance between the Helvetic and the Augsburg Confessions. Instead of the former two <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> bodies in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, there were now three: the Reformed Church, the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, and the united Evangelical. The Reformed was the weakest in numbers; and in <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> its sole distinctive tenet was the rejection of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> teaching concerning the Eucharist. Neither was the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> flourishing; <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> existed only in the <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> aspirations of a few <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>, <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>, and jurists. A union without a uniform confession and liturgy is but a loose mass, unworthy to be called a church. Frederick William, therefore, attempted to consolidate his Evangelical Church by giving it a common liturgy composed by himself with the assistance of the court <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a> and a <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a>. This "Agenda" was made <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by royal order for the royal <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, and for the army; its general adoption was only recommended. It met with determined opposition as a measure oppressive of evangelical freedom, antiquated, leaning to "Romanish" practices, unsettling men's consciences. None the less, by 1825 it had been adopted by 5343 churches out of 7782. The <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> Eylert and Neander in Berlin were in favour of it and of the measures taken to enforce it. In 1828-29 the "Agenda" was issued in a revised form and made binding on all <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches, some concessions being granted to <a href="13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, and other parts of the kingdom, in deference to provincial uses. The <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, fearing the loss of their confessional status, offered increased resistance. But the king was inexorable. Dr. Scheibel, professor in <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, and others of the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> who had refused to accept the new liturgy, were suspended from their offices. For several years a fierce <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> raged against the "Old Lutherans", especially in <a href="13790b.htm">Silesia</a> and the Grand Duchy of Posen. Preacher Hahn headed the troops which were sent to subdue the <a href="12677a.htm">recusant</a> villagers by seizure of their goods, <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and all manner of <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a>. Minister von Altenstein justified these measures on the principle that it was the Government's <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to protect these blind sectarians against the consequences of their own folly. Thousands of the <a href="12677a.htm">recusants</a> were driven to <a href="10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to America and Australia. Not a voice was raised in their defence; the whole Liberal press lauded the energy of the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government. By a royal decree of 28 Feb., 1834, all <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> worship was declared illegal.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Frederick William III ruled his Church as <em>summus episcopus</em>, as a <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> without a fixed deposit of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> to guard, or a <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> Divinely <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> to co-operate with him. The result was arbitrariness in the rule, disorganization in the ruled. The king's first royal decrees aimed at the conciliation of religion with the prevailing <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> philosophy, but the misfortunes of the year 1806 and the death of his beloved consort turned his mind more and more to the religion of revelation and mysteries. Considering himself the protector and leader of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> he endeavoured to raise it from degradation by forcing unity upon it with a strong hand; unity not in <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, for he disliked <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> "who pretend to be more Christian than Christ", but in liturgy, wherein his sincere <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> found sufficient satisfaction. In 1831 he surprised Superintendent Eylert with an essay on the <a href="08631b.htm">power of the keys</a> and the binding and loosing power in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; it contained an attempt to reintroduce auricular confession and the old church discipline. All his efforts, however, only ended in greater division. At his death, in 1840, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of his creation was still a chaos of warring <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>, irresponsive to the brooding of the royal mind and restive to the royal arm.</p>

<p>Frederick William IV immediately set free the <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and allowed the formation of separate congregations. The Old Lutherans now founded a "separate Lutheran Church" at <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a> under the direction of the lawyer Huschke. By the "general concession" of 1845 they were recognized as Dissenters with legal status but without pecuniary support from the State. The new <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> was, however, wanting in union and cohesion: Diedrich opposed Huschke and the <em>Oberkirchencollegium</em> (supreme <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> council); frictions among members were of frequent occurrence. But few of the discontented <a href="04049b.htm">clergymen</a> had left the established Evangelical Church to join the Old Lutherans; the majority remained at their posts for various reasons: within the Union they had a better opportunity for working its destruction than without; they were unwilling to sacrifice their incomes from the State and consequent independence from the financial support of their parishioners; they feared, in many cases, to be altogether abandoned by indifferent congregations. The defenders of the union argued that its disruption would produce at least five particular churches at <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with one another and powerless to withstand the inroads of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; that the union was a <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> achievement to be supported by all <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> lovers of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the Union demanded a <em>consensus-symbolum</em>, "an <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> formula in which the consensus of the two Churches was to be contained without depriving the individual congregation of the right of giving a call on the ground of the particular confession" (Gardner, I, 967); others were satisfied with a confederation professing no formulated creed and resting solely on unfettered <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. The trend of <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> thought during this period, the middle of the nineteenth century, followed the impulse given by the king. Frederick William IV's motto was: "I and my house intend to serve the Lord". He was piously, even pietistically, inclined, <a href="07149b.htm">hated</a> infidelity and <a href="11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, cherished the Divine right of kings, and <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> to dream of ancient institutions in <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. In a short time the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, and in their wake the other German <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, except Giessen and Jena, became centres of positive <a href="02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and tendencies. The king favoured men of his own thinking and made known his dislike to transfer the arduous <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of his "supreme episcopate" to free <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> formed on the apostolic model. Theological teaching in <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and press, although starting from the same positive creeds, diverged in two different streams. On the one side there were the partisans of a <em>via media</em>, endeavouring to find the golden mean between the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Confession of Faith and the <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> of the period. On the other side stood the Neo-Lutherans. These <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> held to <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on justification but rejected his invisible Church and universal <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; they defended a Divinely <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and their teaching on sacrifice, orders, and <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> nearly approached the Roman. This current runs parallel with <a href="12582a.htm">Puseyism</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>; Hengstenberg (died 1869) was its main support.</p>

<p>The General Synod of <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a> (2 June-29 Aug., 1846) had given rise to great hopes for the consolidation of the Union. It was resolved that the National Evangelical Church should have no other basis than the "consensus"; that the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> councils (<em>Gemeinde-Presbyterien</em>) and consistories be amalgamated so that <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> might work together; that a standing general synod be added to the standing supreme consistory (<em>Oberconsistorium</em>). The crucial task of the synod was to find an acceptable formula of consensus. Karl Immanuel Nitzsch, of Bonn, set up a profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> intended to take the place of the reformed formularies: it consisted of vague Biblical texts into which both <a href="09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and Reformed might easily read their particular doctrines or no particular <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> at all. The synod accepted the formula. But the country received it with scorn and contempt, and it was rejected by everyone. Hengstenberg in his "Kirchenzeitung" branded the synod as a Robber Synod, a denial of Christ; its decrees were not to be executed, because they failed to give expression to "the general <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> consciousness". The consensus only served to increase existing dissensions. The most vital questions divided the leading minds: Was the territorial ruler by right the <em>summus episcopus</em> within his territory? Was it advisable to impose an evangelical church discipline, and if so, which? What part was to be conceded to <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> in the ministry of the Word and of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>?</p>

<p>The very sterility of controversy turned some practical men from words to works: the "Inner Mission" was originated (1848) by Wicheren, the founder of the Hamburg <em>Rauhes Haus</em> (properly R&uuml;ge's House, from the name of its former occupant), an institution which covers almost the whole field of <a href="03592a.htm">Christian charity</a>. The preacher Fliedner (died 1864) instituted the order of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, an imitation of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Sisters of Charity in the main objects of their life. Court preacher Zimmermann of Darmstadt founded the Gustav-Adolfs-Verein (1841-2), a union whose avowed primary object is to support the evangelical missions in outlying districts (the <a href="04775c.htm">Diaspora</a>), its secondary object being to bind together all <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> regardless of denominational differences, and to oppose a solid bulwark to the encroachments of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The secondary object caused a split in the Union. At the general assembly in Berlin (1846) the K&ouml;nigsberg preacher Rupp, who had been deprived of his office for breaking away from the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> formularies and from the national Church, presented himself as a deputy. On the question of his admission as such the assembly disagreed: Rupp was, however, excluded by a small majority, a distinct breach of the principles of the Union. The meeting of 1847 resolved that henceforth the Union should direct its main efforts to the "conversion of the Roman Catholics", a resolution to which it has remained faithful to this day.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The short-lived movement of the "Protestant Friends", or "Friends of Light", was started in opposition to pietistic <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> which threatened freedom in teaching. Article 3 of the programme which they issued from the Moravian settlement at Gnadenau, in 1841, runs: "We hold it to be our right and our <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to submit to the test of our reason whatever is set before us as religion." Ulich, a simple-minded man who had the gift of popular preaching, and Pastor Wislicenus, a downright <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalist</a>, were the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> of this movement. The Berlin magistrates presented to King Frederick William IV an address conceived in the spirit of the Protestant Friends. They entreated him to grant the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> a free constitution in keeping with the needs of the time, and freedom of teaching limited only by public morality and the safety of the State. The king in person received his <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> municipality, who paraded in fourteen state coaches before the royal castle. His pietism was ruffled by the pretensions of the town councillors; in language not over gracious he told them to mind their own business. This happened 22 August, 1845; it marks the end of the Protestant Friends but also the beginning of the "Free Communities" (<em>Freie Gemeinden</em>). As formerly the right wing of the Union had seceded to form Neo-Lutheran communities, so now the left wing withdrew to form dissenting <a href="12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> congregations. Their meetings were prohibited, but Rupp, Ulich, and Wislicenus resisted until by royal decree of 30 March, 1847, the new dissenters were allowed to separate from the Established Church without the loss of their civil <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>; yet not without many vexatious formalities and expenses. The Free Communities, wanting internal cohesion to resist the royal disfavour and the ceaseless assaults of the dominant pietist clique, came to a speedy end.</p>

<p>The wave of liberal aspirations which rolled over <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1848 left its mark on the Churches in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Paragraph 15 of the new Constitution read: "The Evangelical, and the <a href="13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a>, and every other religious <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, orders and manages its own affairs independently (<em>selbstst&auml;ndig</em>)." The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had the benefit of this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> until the beginning of the <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, but among the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, the ruling <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> pietists, led by Hengstenberg, were determined that no freedom should be given to any other party. They evaded the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> by a new theory, viz, the king being the <em>pr&oelig;cipuum membrum ecclesi&oelig;</em>, i.e. the chief member of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, rules it by an inherent right which no law can take from him; in fact Par. 15 makes the territorial lord quite independent of all State interference with his management of his own Church. The king himself did not favour this extraordinary <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. "Do I look like a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>?" he said, pointing to his uniform and spurs. His ideal was "the small independent <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community managing its own affairs in the spirit of the universal Church" as in the days of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The ideal of his minister von Raumer and of Hengstenberg was to train <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <em>Unterthanenverstand</em>, i.e. a mentality fit for people under strict authority: <a href="02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, obey the king, and ask no questions. The alliance of politics, <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and pietism, royal cabinet-orders and counter-orders, general unsettledness and discontent, and five authorized churches instead of one &mdash; such was the result of the Union of 1817 in the fourth decade of its existence. Many attempts at a more real and more general union were made on the basis of practical charity, federation, opposition to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; church conferences were held in <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, Eisenach, and elsewhere; the Gustav-Adolf-Verein and the Inner Mission were founded; the English Evangelical Alliance was invited to Berlin (1857). The result was greater discord and disruption.</p>

<p>William I, who as Regent, King of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and German Emperor reigned from 1858 to 1888, was an honest, single-minded, and industrious ruler. He had little sympathy with the Constitution and none at all with Hengstenberg's agitation for enforcing <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. He maintained the Constitution as the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the land. But of the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party he said in an address to his newly constituted ministry: ". . .In both Churches [<a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>] all endeavours to make religion a cloak for politics must be strenuously opposed. In the Evangelical Church &mdash; we cannot deny it &mdash; an <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> has found a footing which is in contradiction with the fundamental <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Union, and which has <a href="07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> in its train. That <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> has impeded the work of the Union has almost wrecked it. Now it is my will that the Union be maintained intact . . ." Until 1866, however, little was done to carry out William's programme; it was impossible and unadvisable to dismiss all the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> office-bearers and professors appointed for their opinions during the last eighteen years. The new minister of worship, von Muehler, was dominated by Queen Augusta, a highly <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> devoted to <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, who suggested candidates for higher positions and insisted on their appointment (Hase, Neue Kircheng., 305). By her stood Hengstenberg and Hoffman, a fanatical Swabian. Together they worked for the preservation of the old regime. The Liberal party meanwhile found a common centre and a driving power in the <em>Protestantenverein</em> (Protestant Union), founded in 1863 at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a> with the object of defeating both <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. It spread at first but slowly, as it found little support among the still faithful masses and met with open hostility among the ruling classes, in 1906 it numbered 27,000 members.</p>

<p>After the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1866) the acquisition of new territories laid upon William I the task of again regulating the religious situation of his kingdom. The Hengstenberg party proposed a measure which would have dealt the death-blow to the Union, viz, to divide the Supreme Church Council into three senates: a <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, a Reformed, and a United, each with circumscribed territorial <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. But the Supreme Council refused to take this step and persuaded the king to leave to the new provinces their existing church constitutions as long as they chose to maintain them. This was done. To a deputation from the Hanover Consistory William I expressed his Conviction that "the Evangelical Union was best furthered by free and unprejudiced hearts working towards unity in charity." The slight difficulties which arose locally, e.g. in <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, were probably due as much to political as to religious sentiments. The political unity of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> achieved through the Franco-German War (1870-71) naturally aroused a strong desire for religious unity in the new empire. Bismarck started the <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> to bring the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> into line with the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> majority, but had to acknowledge himself vanquished in 1886. For the unification of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in the empire only one way was open: to abolish legal pressure and to allow the various religious bodies to work out their own <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> in their own way. The emperor, however, was loath to dismiss at once the <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> and officials who had so faithfully stood by him in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>; von Muehler retained his post and Empress Augusta her influence; the old system continued for a while with but slight concessions to liberty. The relation between the State and the Evangelical Church was finally fixed by the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of 10 Sept., 1873, and 30 May, 1876. At the head of the whole organization stands the Supreme Ecclesiastical Council (<em>Oberkirchenrat</em>) in <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, consisting of twelve regular members, one <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vice-president, and a lay president. Under this council are eight provincial consistories, K&ouml;nigsberg, <a href="02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, Stettin, <a href="02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, Posen, <a href="09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, and Coblenz; and under them the superintendents numbering 415. In the Evangelical State Church the two types of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> are united; no distinction is made between <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and Reformed either in the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties or in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> Bible is in common use, the various collections of <a href="07595a.htm">hymns</a> have no denominational character. The emperor, or King of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, is <em>summus episcopus</em>, which, however, is a title rather than an office. In matters of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> the royal pronouncements neither claim, nor are they credited with, <a href="07790a.htm">infallibility</a>; and matters of administration are left to the councils and consistories elected by the people.</p>

<p>The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> status of the United Evangelical Church in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> may be fitly described as <a href="10415a.htm">Modernism</a> in the sense of the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi". The simple country folk, who practise more than they think, still follow the religion of older generations, but the socialist masses of the towns are either indifferent or openly hostile to all <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> religion. Owing to the principle sanctioned in 1648 "that all the subjects must follow the religion of their ruler" the population, from a religious point of view, is less mixed in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> than in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> or America. Numerically, the two confessions are in the same proportion as they were 300 years ago: two <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to one <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Conversions from one religion to the other almost balance with a slight excess in favour of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. This is entirely due to <a href="09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> and temporal allurements. The efforts of proselytizing <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, such as the Gustav-Adolf-Verein, the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and the Evangelical Unions, show but poor results. Statistics from the census of 1900 are as follows: Evangelical Church in <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>: 8158 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 17,246 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a>, etc., 10,071 <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and 21,817,577 adherents against 12,110,229 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which gives the proportion of 5 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to 9 <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. For the whole <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a> the proportion is 7 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to 12 <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, i.e. 20,321,441 to 35,231,104.</p>
