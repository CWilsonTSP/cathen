<p>Scholasticism is a term used to designate both a method and a system. It is applied to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> as well as to philosophy. Scholastic theology is distinguished from Patristic <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> on the one hand, and from <a href="14580a.htm">positive theology</a> on the other. The schoolmen themselves distinguished between <em>theologia speculativa sive scholastica</em> and <em>theologia positiva</em>. Applied to philosophy, the word "Scholastic" is often used also, to designate a chronological division intervening between the end of the Patristic era in the fifth century and the beginning of the modern era, about 1450. It will, therefore, make for clearness and order if we consider:</p>

<blockquote><p>I. The origin of the word "Scholastic"; <br>II. The history of the period called Scholastic in the history of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; <br>III. The Scholastic method in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, with incidental reference to the Scholastic method in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>; and <br>IV. The contents of the Scholastic system.</p></blockquote>

<p>The revival of Scholasticism in recent times has been already treated under the head <a href="10746a.htm">NEO-SCHOLASTICISM</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section1">Origin of the name "Scholastic"</h2>

<p>There are in Greek literature a few instances of the use of the word <em>scholastikos</em> to designate a professional <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. Historically, however, the word, as now used, is to be traced, not to Greek usage, but to early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> institutions. In the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, especially after the beginning of the sixth century, it was customary to call the head of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> <em>magister scholae, capiscola</em>, or <em>scholasticus</em>. As time went on, the last of these appellations was used exclusively. The curriculum of those <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> included <a href="04770a.htm">dialectic</a> among the seven liberal arts, which was at that time the only branch of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> studied systematically. The head of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> generally taught dialectic, and out of his teaching grew both the manner of philosophizing and the system of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that prevailed during all the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Consequently, the name "Scholastic" was used and is still used to designate the method and system that grew out of the academic curriculum of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> or, more definitely, out of the <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> teaching of the masters of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> (<em>scholastici</em>). It does not matter that, historically, the Golden Age of Scholastic philosophy, namely, the thirteenth century, falls within a period when the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, the curriculum of which was the seven liberal arts, including dialectic had given way to another organization of studies, the studia generalia, or <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>. The name, once given, continued, as it almost always does, to designate the method and system which had by this time passed into a new phase of development. Academically, the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the thirteenth century are known as <em>magistri</em>, or masters; historically, however, they are Scholastics, and continue to be so designated until the end of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval period</a>. And, even after the close of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> or <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> who adopts the method or the system of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> Scholastics is said to be a Scholastic.</p>

<h2 id="section2">The Scholastic period</h2>

<p>The period extending from the beginning of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> speculation to the time of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, inclusive, is known as the Patristic era in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In general, that era inclined to <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a> and underestimated the importance of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. The Fathers strove to construct on <a href="12159a.htm">Platonic</a> principles a system of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy. They brought reason to the aid of Revelation. They leaned, however, towards the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the mystics, and, in ultimate resort, relied more on spiritual <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> than on <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> for the establishment and explanation of the highest <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Between the end of the Patristic era in the fifth century and the beginning of the Scholastic era in the ninth there intervene a number of intercalary thinkers, as they may be called, like Claudianus Mamertus, <a href="02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>, <a href="02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> etc., who helped to hand down to the new generation the traditions of the Patristic age and to continue into the Scholastic era the current of <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a>. With the Carolingian revival of learning in the ninth century began a period of <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> activity which resulted in a new phase of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> thought known as Scholasticism. The first masters of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in the ninth century <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, <a href="12617a.htm">Rabanus</a>, etc., were not indeed, more original than <a href="02610b.htm">Boethius</a> or <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>; the first original thinker in the Scholastic era was John the Scot (see <a href="05519a.htm">JOHN SCOTUS ERIUGENA</a>). Nevertheless they inaugurated the Scholastic movement because they endeavoured to bring the Patristic (principally the Augustinian) tradition into touch with the new life of <a href="09022a.htm">European Christianity</a>. They did not abandon <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a>. They <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> little of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> except as a <a href="09324a.htm">logician</a>. But by the emphasis they laid on <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> reasoning, they gave a new direction to <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In the curriculum of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in which they taught, philosophy was represented by dialectic. On the textbooks of dialectic which they used they wrote commentaries and glosses, into which, little by little, they admitted problems of <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a>, <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, <a href="04413a.htm">cosmology</a>, and <a href="05556a.htm">ethics</a>, so that the Scholastic movement as a whole may be said to have sprung from the discussions of the dialecticians.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Method, contents, and conclusions were influenced by this origin. There resulted a species of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> which more than any other trait characterizes Scholastic philosophy in every successive stage of its development and marks it off very definitely from the Patristic philosophy, which, as has been said, was ultimately <a href="08082b.htm">intuitional</a> and mystic. With <a href="13189c.htm">Roscelin</a>, who appeared about the middle of the eleventh century, the note of <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> is very distinctly sounded, and the first rumbling is heard of the inevitable reaction, the voice of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> uttering its note of warning, and condemning the excess into which <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> had fallen. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, therefore, Scholasticism passed through its period of storm and stress. On the one side were the advocates of reason, <a href="13189c.htm">Roscelin</a>, <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>; on the other were the champions of <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, <a href="11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>, <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, and the Victorines. Like all ardent advocates, the <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> went too far at first, and only gradually brought their method within the lines of <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and harmonized it with <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> reverence for the mysteries of Faith. Like all conservative reactionists, the mystics at first condemned the use as well as the abuse of reason; they did not reach an intelligent compromise with the dialecticians until the end of the twelfth century. In the final outcome of the struggle, it was <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> that, having modified its unreasonable claims, triumphed in the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, without, however driving the mystics from the field.</p>

<p>Meantime, Eclectics, like <a href="08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, and <a href="12159a.htm">Platonists</a>, like the members of the School of <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, gave to the Scholastic movement a broader spirit of toleration, imparted, so to speak, a sort of <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a> to philosophy, so that, when we come to the eve of the thirteenth century, Scholasticism has made two very decided steps in advance. First, the use of reason in the discussion of spiritual <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and the application of dialectic to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> are accepted with. out protest, so long as they are kept within the bounds of moderation. Second, there is a willingness on the part of the Schoolmen to go outside the lines of strict <a href="15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> and learn, not only from <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, who was now beginning to be known as a metaphysician and a <a href="12545b.htm">psychologist</a>, but also from the Arabians and the <a href="08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whose works had begun to penetrate in Latin translations into the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="09022a.htm">Christian Europe</a>. The taking of Constantinople in 1204, the introduction of <a href="01663a.htm">Arabian</a>, Jewish, and Greek works into the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, the rise of the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a>, and the foundation of the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> &#151; these are the events which led to the extraordinary <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity of the thirteenth century, which centered in the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. At first there was considerable confusion, and it seemed as if the battles won in the twelfth century by the dialecticians should be fought over again. The translations of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> made from the Arabian and accompanied by Arabian commentaries were tinged with <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, Fatalism, and other Neoplatonic <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>. Even in the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> there were declared <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheists</a>, like <a href="04645a.htm">David of Dinant</a>, and outspoken <a href="02150c.htm">Averroists</a>, like <a href="13784a.htm">Siger of Brabant</a>, who bade fair to prejudice the cause of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>.</p>

<p>These developments were suppressed by the most stringent disciplinary measures during the first few decades of the thirteenth century. While they were still a source of danger, men like <a href="15631c.htm">William of Auvergne</a> and <a href="01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> hesitated between the traditional <a href="02091a.htm">Augustinianism</a> of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and the new <a href="01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>, which came from a suspected source. Besides, <a href="02091a.htm">Augustinianism</a> and <a href="12159a.htm">Platonism</a> accorded with <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, while <a href="01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a> was found to lack the element of <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. In time, however, the translations made from the Greek revealed an <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> free from the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> attributed to him by the Arabians, and, above all, the commanding genius of <a href="01264a.htm">St. Albertus Magnus</a> and his still more illustrious disciple, <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, who appeared at the critical moment, calmly surveyed the difficulties of the situation, and met them fearlessly, won the victory for the new philosophy and continued successfully the traditions established in the preceding century. Their contemporary, <a href="02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, showed that the new learning was not incompatible with <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> drawn from <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> sources, and <a href="13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a> demonstrated by his unsuccessful attempts to develop the natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> the possibilities of another kind which were latent in <a href="01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>.</p>

<p>With <a href="05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, a genius of the first order, but not of the constructive type, begins the critical phase, of Scholasticism. Even before his time, the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> currents had set out in divergent directions. It was his keen and unrelenting search for the weak points in <a href="14698b.htm">Thomistic philosophy</a> that irritated and wounded susceptibilities among the followers of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and brought about the spirit of partisanship which did so much to dissipate the energy of Scholasticism in the fourteenth century. The recrudescence of <a href="02150c.htm">Averroism</a> in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, the excessive cultivation of formalism and subtlety, the growth of artificial and even barbarous terminology, and the neglect of the study of nature and of history contributed to the same result. <a href="15636a.htm">Ockham's</a> <a href="11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> and <a href="05207a.htm">Durandus's</a> attempt to "simplify" Scholastic philosophy did not have the effect which their authors intended. "The glory and power of scholasticism faded into the warmth and brightness of <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>," and <a href="06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, <a href="14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>, and <a href="05274a.htm">Eckhart</a> are more representative of what the <a href="03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> was actually thinking in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries than are the <a href="14698b.htm">Thomists</a>, <a href="13610b.htm">Scotists</a>, and <a href="15636a.htm">Ockhamists</a> of that period, who frittered away much valuable time in the discussion of highly technical questions which arose within the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and possess little interest except for adepts in Scholastic subtlety. After the rise of <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, when the <a href="12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, which ushered in the modern era, was in full progress, the great Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese commentators inaugurated an age of more healthy Scholasticism, and the great <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> teachers, Toletus, Vasquez, and Francisco Su&aacute;rez, seemed to recall the best days of thirteenth century speculation. The triumph of scientific discovery, with which, as a rule, the representatives of Scholasticism in the seats of academic authority had, unfortunately, too little sympathy, led to new ways of philosophizing, and when, finally, <a href="04744b.htm">Descartes</a> in practice, if not in theory, effected a complete separation of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> from <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, the modern era had begun and the age known as that of Scholasticism had come to an end.</p>

<h2 id="section3">The Scholastic method</h2>

<p>No method in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> has been more <a href="08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned than that of the Scholastics. No philosophy has been more grossly misrepresented. And this is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> not only of the details, but also of the most essential elements of Scholasticism. Two charges, especially, are made against the Schoolmen: First, that they confounded philosophy with <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>; and second, that they made reason subservient to authority. As a matter of fact, the very essence of Scholasticism is, first, its clear delimitation of the respective domains of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and, second, its advocacy of the use of reason.</p>

<h3 id="A">Theology and philosophy</h3>

<p><a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> thinkers, from the beginning, were confronted with the question: How are we to reconcile reason with revelation, <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> with <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, philosophy with <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>? The first apologists possessed no philosophy of their own. They had to deal with a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> world proud of its literature and its philosophy, ready at any moment to flaunt its inheritance of wisdom in the face of <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The apologists met the situation by a theory that was as audacious as it must have been disconcerting to the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>. They advanced the explanation that all the wisdom of <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a> and the other Greeks was due to the inspiration of the <a href="09328a.htm"><em>Logos</em></a>; that it was <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and, therefore, could not be in contradiction with the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation contained in the Gospels. It was a hypothesis calculated not only to silence a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> opponent, but also to work constructively. We find it in <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, in <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and even in <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. The <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> that the two orders of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, the natural and the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, must harmonize, is the inspiration of <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity in the Patristic era. But that era did little to define the limits of the two realms of <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> believes that <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> aids reason (<em>credo ut intelligam</em>) and that reason aids <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>intelligo ut credam</em>); he is, however, inclined to emphasize the first principle and not the second. He does not develop a definite methodology in dealing with them. The Scholastics, almost from the first, attempted to do so.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>John <a href="05519a.htm">Scotus Eriugena</a>, in the ninth century, by his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that all <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> is a theophany, or showing forth of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, tried to elevate philosophy to the rank of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and identify the two in a species of <a href="14626a.htm">theosophy</a>. <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a>, in the twelfth century, tried to bring <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> down to the level of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and identify both in a <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> system. The greatest of the Scholastics in the thirteenth century, especially <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, solved the problem for all time, so far as <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> speculation is concerned, by showing that the two are distinct <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and yet that they agree. They are distinct, he teaches, because, while philosophy relies on reason alone, <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> uses the <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> derived from revelation, and also because there are some <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a>, the mysteries of Faith, which lie completely outside the domain of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and belong to <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. They agree, and must agree, because <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is the author of all <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and it is impossible to think that He would teach in the natural order anything that contradicts what He teaches in the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. The recognition of these principles is one of the crowning achievements of Scholasticism. It is one of the characteristics that mark it off from the Patristic era, in which the same principles were, so to speak, in solution, and not crystallized in definite expression. It is the trait which differentiates Scholasticism from <a href="02150c.htm">Averroism</a>. It is the inspiration of all Scholastic effort. As long as it lasted Scholasticism lasted, and as soon as the opposite conviction became established, the conviction, namely, that what is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> may be <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Scholasticism ceased to exist. It is, therefore, a matter of constant surprise to those who <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> Scholasticism to find it misrepresented on this vital point.</p>

<h3 id="B">Scholastic rationalism</h3>

<p>Scholasticism sprang from the study of dialectic in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The most decisive battle of Scholasticism was that which it waged in the twelfth century against the mystics who condemned the use of dialectic. The distinguishing mark of Scholasticism in the age of its highest development is its use of the <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> method. It is, therefore, a matter, once more, for surprise, to find Scholasticism accused of undue subservience to authority and of the neglect of reason. <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> is a word which has various meanings. It is sometimes used to designate a system which, refusing to acknowledge the authority of revelation, tests all <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> by the standard of reason. In this sense, the Scholastics were not <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalists</a>. The <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> of Scholasticism consists in the conviction that reason is to be used in the elucidation of spiritual <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> and in defence of the <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of Faith. It is opposed to <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, which distrusted reason and placed emphasis on <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a> and contemplation. In this milder meaning of the term, all the Scholastics were convinced <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalists</a>, the only difference being that some, like <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard</a> and <a href="13189c.htm">Roscelin</a>, were too ardent in their advocacy of the use of reason, and went so far as to maintain that reason can prove even the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> mysteries of Faith, while others, like <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, moderated the claims of reason, set limits to its power of proving spiritual <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and maintained that the mysteries of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> could not be discovered and cannot be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by unaided reason.</p>

<p>The whole Scholastic movement, therefore, is a <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> movement in the second sense of the term <a href="12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>. The Scholastics used their reason; they applied dialectic to the study of nature, of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> and of <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. Far from depreciating reason, they went as far as man can go &#151; some modern critics think they went too far &#151; in the application of reason to the discussion of the <a href="05089a.htm">dogmas of Faith</a>. They acknowledged the authority of revelation, as all <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to do. They admitted the force of human authority when the conditions of its valid application were verified. But in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, the authority of revelation did not coerce their reason and in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and in natural <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> they taught very emphatically that the argument from authority is the weakest of all arguments. They did not subordinate reason to authority in any unworthy sense of that phrase. It was an opponent of the Scholastic movement who styled philosophy "the handmaid of theology", a designation which, however, some of the Schoolmen accepted to mean that to philosophy belongs the honourable task of carrying the light which is to guide the footsteps of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. One need not go so far as to say, with Barth&eacute;lemy Saint Hilaire, that "Scholasticism, in its general result, is the first revolt of the modern spirit against authority." Nevertheless, one is compelled by the facts of history to admit that there is more <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> in that description than in the superficial judgment of the historians who describe Scholasticism as the subordination of reason to authority.</p>

<h3 id="C">Details of Scholastic method</h3>

<p>The Scholastic manner of treating the problems of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> is apparent from a glance at the body of literature which the Schoolmen produced. The immense amount of commentary on <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, on <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, on <a href="02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, on <a href="05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>, and on the Scriptures indicates the form of academic activity which characterizes the Scholastic period. The use of texts dates from the very beginning of the Scholastic era in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and was continued down into modern times. The mature teacher, however, very often embodied the results of his own speculation in a <em>Summa</em>, which, in time became a text in the hands of his successors. The <em>Questiones disputatae</em> were special treatises on the more difficult or the more important topics, and as the name implied, followed the method of debate prevalent in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, generally called disputation or determination. The <em>Quodlibeta</em> were miscellanies generally in the form of answers to questions which as soon as a teacher had attained a widespread renown, began to come to him, not only from the academic world in which he lived, but from all classes of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> and from every part of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. The division of topics in <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> was determined by the arrangement followed in <a href="11768d.htm">Peter Lombard's</a> "Books of Sentences" (see SUMMAE), and in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> it adhered closely to the order of treatises in <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> works. There is a good deal of divergence among the principal Scholastics in the details of arrangement, as well as in the relative values of the sub-titles, "part", "question", "disputation", "article", etc. All, however, adopt the manner of treatment by which thesis, objections, and solutions of objections stand out distinctly in the discussion of each problem. We find traces of this in Gerbert's little treatise "De rational) et ratione uti" in the tenth century, and it is still more definitely adopted in <a href="01036b.htm">Abelard's</a> "Sic et non". It had its root in <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> method, but was determined more immediately by the <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> activity of the early <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, from which, as was said, Scholasticism sprang.</p>

<p>Much has been said both in praise and in blame of Scholastic terminology in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. It is rather generally acknowledged that whatever precision there is in the modern languages of Western <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> is due largely to the dialectic disquisitions of the Scholastics. On the other hand, ridicule has been poured on the stiffness, the awkwardness, and the barbarity of the Scholastic style. In an impartial study of the question, it should be remembered that the Scholastics of the thirteenth century&mdash;and it was not they but their successors who were guilty of the grossest <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> of style&mdash;were confronted with a terminological problem unique in the history of thought. They came suddenly into possession of an entirely new literature, the works of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. They spoke a language, Latin, on which the terminology of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> in <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a> etc., had made no impression. Consequently, they were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to create all at once Latin words and phrases to express the terminology of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, a terminology remarkable for its extent, its variety, and its technical complexity. They did it honestly and humbly, by translating <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> phrases literally; so that many a strange-sounding Latin phrase in the writings of the Schoolmen would be very good <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> Greek, if rendered word for word into that language. The Latin of the best of the Scholastics may be lacking in elegance and distinction; but no one will deny the merits of its rigorous severity of phrase and its <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> soundness of construction. Though wanting the <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> of what is called the fine style, <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> which have the power of pleasing but do not facilitate the task of the learner in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the style of the thirteenth-century masters possesses the fundamental qualities, clearness, conciseness, and richness of technical phrase.</p>

<h2 id="section4">The contents of the Scholastic system</h2>

<p>In <a href="09324a.htm">logic</a> the Scholastics adopted all the details of the <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> system, which was known to the Latin world from the time of <a href="02610b.htm">Boethius</a>. Their individual contributions consisted of some minor improvements in the matter of teaching and in the technic of the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. Their underlying theory of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is also <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a>. It may be described by saying that it is a system of Moderate Realism and Moderate Intellectualism. The Realism consists in teaching that outside the mind there exist things fundamentally universal which correspond to our universal <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The Moderate Intellectualism is summed up in the two principles:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>all our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is derived from sense-knowledge; and</li><li>intellectual <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> differs from sense-knowledge, not only in degree but also in kind.</li></ul></div>

<p>In this way, Scholasticism avoids Innatism, according to which all our <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, or some of our <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, are born with the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and have no origin in the world outside us. At the same time, it avoids Sensism, according to which our so-called <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is only sense-knowledge of a higher or finer sort. The Scholastics, moreover, took a firm stand against the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Subjectivism. In their discussion of the value of <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they held that there is an external world which is real and independent of our thoughts. In that world are the forms which make things to be what they are. The same forms received into the mind in the process of knowing cause us not to be the object but to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> the object. This presence of things in the mind by means of forms is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> representation, or rather presentation. For it is the objective thing that we are first aware of, not its representation in us.</p>

<p>The Scholastic outlook on the world of nature is <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a>. The Schoolmen adopt the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and form, which they apply not only to living things but also to inorganic nature. Since the form, or entelechy is always striving for its own realization or actualization, the view of nature which this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> leads to is teleological. Instead, however, of ascribing purpose in a vague, unsatisfactory manner to nature itself, the Scholastics attributed design to the intelligent, provident author of nature. The principle of finality thus acquired a more precise meaning, and at the same time the danger of a <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> interpretation was avoided. On the question of the universality of matter the Schoolmen were divided among themselves, some, like the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> teachers, maintaining that all created beings are material, others, like <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, holding the existence of "separate forms", such as the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a>, in whom there is potency but no matter. Again, on the question of the oneness of substantial forms, there was a lack of agreement. St. Thomas held that in each individual material substance, organic or inorganic, there is but one substantial form, which confers being, substantiality and, in the case of man, life, sensation, and reason. Others, on the contrary, believed that in one substance, man, for instance, there are simultaneously several forms, one of which confers existence, another substantiality, another life, and another, reason. Finally, there was a divergence of views as to what is the principle of individuation, by which several <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> of the same species are differentiated from one another. St. Thomas taught that the principle of individuation is matter with its determined dimensions, <em>materia signata</em>.</p>

<p>In regard to the nature of man, the first Scholastics were Augustinians. Their definition of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is what may be called the spiritual, as opposed to the biological, definition. They held that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is the principle of thought-activity, and that the exercise of the senses is a process from the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> through the body not a process of the whole organism, that is, of the body animated by the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. The Scholastics of the thirteenth century frankly adopted the <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> definition of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> as the principle of life, not of thought merely. Therefore, they maintained, man is a compound of body and <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, each of which is an incomplete substantial principle the union being, consequently, immediate, vital, and substantial. For them there is no need of an intermediary "body of light" such as <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> imagined to exist. All the vital activities of the individual human being are ascribed ultimately to the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, as to their active principle, although they may have more immediate principles namely the faculties, such as <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the senses, the vegetative and muscular powers. But while the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is in this way concerned with all the vital functions, being, in fact, the source of them, and the body enters as a passive principle into all the activities of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, exception must be made in the case of immaterial thought-activities. They are, like all the other activities, activities of the individual. The <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is the active principle of them. But the body contributes to them, not in the same intrinsic manner in which it contributes to seeing, hearing, digesting etc., but only in an extrinsic manner, by supplying the materials out of which the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> manufactures <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>. This extrinsic dependence explains the phenomena of fatigue, etc. At the same time it leaves the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> so independent intrinsically that the latter is truly said to be immaterial.</p>

<p>From the immateriality of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> follows its <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Setting aside the possibility of annihilation, a possibility to which all creatures, even the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> are subject, the human <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is naturally <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and its <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>, <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> believes, can be <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> from its immateriality. <a href="05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, however, whose notion of the strict requirements of a demonstration was influenced by his training in mathematics, denies the conclusive force of the argument from immateriality, and calls attention to <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> hesitation or obscurity on this point. <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, as interpreted by the Arabians, was, undoubtedly, opposed to <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>. It was, however, one of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> greatest achievements in <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that, especially in his <em>opusculum</em> "De unitate intellectus", he refuted the Arabian interpretation of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, showed that the active <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> is part of the individual <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, and thus removed the uncertainty which, for the <a href="01713a.htm">Aristoteleans</a>, hung around the notions of immateriality and <a href="07687a.htm">immortality</a>. From the immateriality of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> follows not only that it is <a href="07687a.htm">immortal</a>, but also that it originated by an act of creation. It was created at the moment in which it was united with the body: <em>creando infunditur, et infundendo creatur</em> is the Scholastic phrase.</p>

<p>Scholastic <a href="10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> added to the <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> system a full discussion of the nature of <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a>, restated in more definite terms the traditional arguments for the <a href="06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, and developed the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the providential government of the <a href="15183a.htm">universe</a>. The exigencies of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussion occasioned also a minute analysis of the nature of accident in general and of quantity in particular. The application of the resulting principles to the explanation of the mystery of the Eucharist, as contained in St. Thomas's works on the subject, is one of the most successful of all the Scholastic attempts to render <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> reasonable by means of <a href="04770a.htm">dialectical</a> discussion. Indeed, it may be said, in general, that the peculiar excellence of the Scholastics as systematic thinkers consisted in their ability to take hold of the profoundest metaphysical distinctions, such as <a href="10053b.htm">matter</a> and form, <a href="01124a.htm">potency and actuality</a>, <a href="14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="01096c.htm">accident</a>, and apply them to every department of thought. They were no mere apriorists, they recognized in principle and in practice that scientific method begins with the observation of facts. Nevertheless, they excelled most of all in the talent which is peculiarly metaphysical, the power to grasp abstract general principles and apply them consistently and systematically.</p>

<p>So far as the ethics of Scholasticism is not distinctly <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, seeking to expound and justify <a href="09071a.htm">Divine law</a> and the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> standard of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, it is <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a>. This is clear from the adoption and application of the <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> definition of virtue as the golden mean between two extremes. Fundamentally, the definition is eudemonistic. It rests on the conviction that the supreme good of man is <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, that <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the realization, or complete actualization, of one's nature, and that virtue is an essential means to that end. But what is vague and unsatisfactory in <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> Eudemonism is made definite and safe in the Scholastic system, which determines the meaning of <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> and realization according to the Divine purpose in creation and the dignity to which man is destined as a child of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>In their discussion of the problems of political philosophy the <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the thirteenth century while not discarding the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> views of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> contained in "The City of God", laid a new foundation for the study of political organizations by introducing <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> scientific definition of the origin and purpose of civil <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. Man, says <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, is naturally a social and political animal. By giving to <a href="09580c.htm">human beings</a> a nature which requires the co-operation of other <a href="09580c.htm">human beings</a> for its welfare, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> man for <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, and thus it is His will that princes should govern with a view to the public welfare. The end for which the state exists is, then, not merely <em>vivere</em> but <em>bene vivere</em>. All that goes to make life better and happier is included the Divine charter from which kings and rulers derive their authority. The Scholastic treatises on this subject and the commentaries on the "Polities" of <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> prepared the way for the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> and modern discussions of political problems. In this department of thought, as in many others, the Schoolmen did at least one service which posterity should appreciate: they strive to express in clear systematic form what was present in the consciousness of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> in their day.</p>
