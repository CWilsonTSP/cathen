<p>(ERNEST LEBERECHT)</p>

<p>German <a href="02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, b. 4 December, 1821, at (Nieder-) Cunnersdorf near L&ouml;bau, Saxony; d. 16 March, 1889, in Arcetri near Florence. Having lost his mother in early infancy, he was placed under a schoolmaster from his ninth to his fourteenth year, and employed as <a href="13748a.htm">sexton</a>, beadle, gardener, and collector of fees on occasions of New Year, of <a href="02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, and marriages. He then learned the art of lithography, and about his twentieth year, went to Copenhagen with letters of recommendation to a distant relative Lehmann, the father of the <a href="04722c.htm">Danish</a> statesmen and journalist, Orla Lehmann. During a three-years' stay he was a welcome and frequent guest with a number of artists and academicians. The <a href="13641b.htm">sculpture</a> Reinhold carved his bust, and the <a href="11395a.htm">painter</a> Bunsen drew his portrait. His German poems to friends and benefactors show a complete mastery of his native tongue. He became enthusiastic over the literature and national songs of the Danes, and translated selections into German, e.g., "King R&eacute;n&eacute;'s Daughter". These three years in <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a> were, as he used to say, his academic career. With a desire to <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> peoples and countries from experience, he went to Christiania, but soon turned his path to the land of the <a href="05248a.htm">fine arts</a>. About 1850 he settled in <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> as lithographer. The Palace of the Doge seems to have attracted his artistic tastes, for he became intimately acquainted with the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the Porter Gambin, whose daughter Marianna he married, embracing at the same time the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. His wife testified that Tempel had never been satisfied with his former religion and purposely chose a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> companion in life. The marriage <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> very <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a>, although not blessed with children. Contact with cultured people in <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> awakened in him a taste for <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>. From his earning he bought a 4-inch (Stienheil) comet-seeker, and in 1859 made two discoveries, one of a comet (designated 1859 I), on 2 April, and another of the Merope-Nebula in the Pleiades, on 19 October. The new talent for discoveries matured in him the plan of embracing the <a href="02025a.htm">astronomical</a> career. In his enthusiasm he moved to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but found that lack of scientific training precluded entrance to the Imperial Observatory. Greatly disappointed by Leverrier, the director, he moved with his wife to <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in 1860, where he was accepted by Benjamin Valz as assistant <a href="02025a.htm">astronomer</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Tempel began his career in <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> with the discoveries of a comet (1860 IV) on 22 October, and of two minor planets on 4 and 8 March, 1861, all with his own 4-inch comet-seeker, on the terrace of the observatory. The position however lasted only half a year, owing partly, it would seem, to continued strained relations with Leverrier. He then settled down once more as lithographer without, however, giving rest to his comet-seeker. From window or garden he discovered, during ten years, no less than thirteen comets and four minor planets, more than half of them new. From <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> he began publishing his observations in the "Astronomische Nachrichten". In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> he missed cordial and <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> intercourse, and a literary attempt of his in "Les Mondes", in May, 1863, on the question of the variability of nebulae, was severely criticized by Leverrier. In the same year (1863) he paid a two-months' visit to his native country, spending most of the time at the observatory of Leipzig. Just two years before, in 1861, a former <a href="02025a.htm">astronomer</a> of Leipzig, d'Arrest, had built a new observatory at <a href="04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>. Unfortunately for Tempel, d'Arrest was the very one who criticized his publication on the Merope-Nebula as exaggerated, although the controversy ended in justifying Tempel's assertion, that nebulae must be observed with low magnifying powers. Tempel's effort, in 1870, to get a position under d'Arrest was fruitless.</p>

<p>In January, 1871, the Provisional Government ordered the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> out of <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. In spite of his experiences in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, Tempel sympathized with the unfortunate country during the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>. Arrived at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> he found in Schiaparelli the man who appreciated his talents. Though he had no academic degrees, he was offered a position in the Brera Observatory. Two of Tempel's comets had attracted Schiaparelli's attention: that of 1866 (I) which furnished to him the <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of connexion with the November stream of meteors, and that of 1867 (II) which <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> to revolve entirely between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter and to run almost parallel with the latter planet in 1869, so as to furnish a type specimen of planetary perturbation. Comet "1869 III" is called Tempel's "third periodic comet", but its periodicity was not recognized until 1880. Four new comets were discovered in <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Comet "1873 II", called Tempel's "second periodic", is remarkable for the shortness of its period, being little over five years, and second only to Encke's comet. Tempel's publication in the <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> "Ephemeris" for 1872 shows that he reduced his own observations. His mind was sufficiently mathematical to acquire the use of logarithms and trigonometry and to draw elliptical orbits. Number V of the Brera Publications contain masterly lithographic plates of a lunar eclipse (1 June, 1863), of the Merope-Nebula, of Jupiter's satellites and a series of Coggia's comet. A more perfect map of the Pleiades appeared in "Monthly Notices" (XL, 1880). Contact with Schiaparelli brought honours to Tempel. The Vienna Academy rewarded him four times for the discovery of comets, the two of 1869 discovered in <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and the two of 1871. Once in 1872, in the absence of the director, he received the Emperor of <a href="02745c.htm">Brazil</a> at the observatory, acted as cicerone, and presented some of his drawings. The year after, he received, through the <a href="02745c.htm">Brazilian</a> Consul, the diploma of "Knight of the Imperial <a href="02745c.htm">Brazilian Order</a> of Roses".</p>

<p>When, in 1873, the Arcetri Observatory lost its director Donati, by death, Schiaparelli proposed Tempel as successor. The severe winters of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and the prospect of an independent position made it easy for Tempel to accept, although the unfinished state of the buildings and instruments, the title and scanty salary of assistant <a href="02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, the lack of <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> and assistants, were fraught with disappointments. After four years' work in <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> (1871-74) Tempel moved to his last station, which he was to hold for fourteen years. He found the observatory situated in an earthly <a href="14519a.htm">paradise</a>. It was designed and commenced in 1869 by Donati, under the University of Florence, but interrupted in 1872 by Donati's sickness. For two years it had been left in this state. The rain poured in on all sides and a wall of the meridian room had to be supported. A description of the observatory is given by Tempel in the "Astr. Nachr.", CII (1882). The predecessor of Donati, Amici, had constructed two object-glasses, one of 9.4 inches and one of 11 inches, large sizes in those times, but their mountings were imperfect and incomplete. The former had a wooden stand and could only be used on the terrace; pointing to objects of over 40&#176; altitude was found dangerous. The mounting of the largest instrument was parallactic, but without divided circles, without clock-work, without clamp and slow motion. The observing chair was a ladder that did not reach to stars within 20&#176; of the horizon. Both instruments had only one eye-piece. The books present contained no star catalogues, and were lying on the floor. Money was still owing on the building, and no resources for the future open. The habitation was so defective that Tempel had to live in a neighbouring villa until his death.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On examination the object-glasses <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> a little defective in colour correction but excellent in definition; hence less adapted for planets but perfectly suitable for comets, asteroids, and nebulae, the very programme of Tempel. Nebulae, however, became now his main field. In Arcetri he picked up only one more comet, "1877 V". The work with the large equatorial <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> very slow and laborious. To find and to identify the stars, the observer had to descend from the ladder, use the comet-seeker on the terrace and make triangulations on the small charts at hand, all without electric light. And yet, after four years' work, Tempel presented to the Royal Academy of the Lincei a collection of drawings of the more interesting nebulae, which secured him the royal prize given every six years for the best <a href="02025a.htm">astronomical</a> work in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The Academy even offered to publish the drawings, but the <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the lithographs did not satisfy the author. The designs are the more valuable as they contain many stars, measured with a double ring-micrometer. Tempel discovered many new nebulae, observed a number that had been neglected since Herschel's time, wrote a mass of careful notes that are not yet published, occasionally correcting <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>. Extracts of his observations are found in the "Astr. Nachr." (vols. 93-113). Drawings of the Orion nebula were published in the "Astr. Nachr.", vol. LVIII (1862), and in the Memoirs of the R. <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Society of 1885 (reviewed in the Vierteljahrsschrift, XXII). Tempel was elected foreign associate of the Royal Astronomical Society of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1881, together with Gyld&eacute;n, Pickering, Tietjen, and Tisserand (Monthly Notices, XLI, 377). In 1886 he was <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> with a letter from King Humbert, handed to him by the Adjutant General, in recognition of his <a href="02025a.htm">astronomical</a> drawings. In the intercourse with scientific men, the lack of academic training betrayed itself occasionally, and Tempel himself regretted all his life that he had not learnt Latin. Diffusiveness of style and uncritical assertions provoked contradiction. A controversy with Dreyer, the <a href="02025a.htm">astronomer</a> of Birr Castle, about the reality of spiral forms in many of Lord Rosse's drawings of nebulae, may be found in "The Observatory" (vols. I-II, 1878). The existence of a faint nebula drawn by Tempel (near H. I 55 Pegasi) was denied by Keeler (Astroph. J. XI, 1900).</p>

<p>Tempel's intercourse with old friends in Copenhagen remained cordial to his end. He received them or friends recommended by them, like brothers, and always regretted that his means did not allow him to revisit Copenhagen. His letters to them breathe a deeply religious spirit. He glories in his honesty from childhood, regrets complaining about injuries received, speaks of the <a href="02599b.htm">blessings</a> of Providence, of friendship beyond death, gives thanks and praises to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, promises <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> to friends and benefactors, and looks confidently towards <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Expressions like these made his <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> friend say in the "Dagbladet": "During the many years' sojourn in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> his mind, which was subject to depressions, had found peace by entering the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>". The same friend assured the writer of this article that, on a visit to Arcetri, he had found Tempel very <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> in his religious convictions. His dearest company was an old <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> who visited him regularly. A <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> from the Convent of Quaracchi was his confessor, and the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> of the Certosa were his friends. Towards the end of 1886 Tempel was attacked by a liver complaint and, in the beginning of 1887, by partial paralysis. Unable to observe, he put his notes in order for publication. During his illness he received the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> repeatedly. The <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of S. Leonardo (now Canon Emilio Nunziati) testifies that Tempel was a thoroughly convinced <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and died a saintly death, having his mind clear to the last. Tempel was hardly sixty-eight years old. He is buried near the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Donati, in the cemetery of S. Felice a Elma, a suburb of Florence. He left neither <a href="04663b.htm">debts</a> nor <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, and his <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> was provided for by what is called in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> a "spaccio di sali e tabacchi", this again, as it seems, through Schiaparelli. More than 186 drawings of nebulae and stars, with numerous notes, are now the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> and deposited in the Tribune of <a href="06342b.htm">Galileo</a> (via Romana). A list of them is in the "Aston. Nachr." CII (1882), and in the "Bohemian Memoirs" (1885).</p>
