<h2 id="section1">Definition of an Eastern Church</h2>

<p>An accident of political development has made it possible to divide the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>, in the first place, into two great halves, Eastern and Western. The root of this division is, roughly and broadly speaking, the division of the Roman Empire made first by <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (284-305), and again by the sons of <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a> (Arcadius in the East, 395-408; and Honorius in the West, 395-423), then finally made permanent by the establishment of a rival empire in the West (<a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, 800). The division of Eastern and <a href="09022a.htm">Western Churches</a>, then, in its origin corresponds to that of the empire.</p>

<p><a href="09022a.htm">Western Churches</a> are those that either gravitate around <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> or broke away from her at the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Eastern Churches depend originally on the <a href="03096a.htm">Eastern Empire</a> at Constantinople; they are those that either find their centre in the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of that city (since the centralization of the fourth century) or have been formed by <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a> which in the first instance concerned Constantinople rather than the Western world.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Another distinction, that can be applied only in the most general and broadest sense, is that of language. <a href="09022a.htm">Western Christendom</a> till the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was Latin; even now the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> bodies still bear unmistakably the mark of their Latin ancestry. It was the great <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>, <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (d. 430) most of all, who built up the traditions of the West; in ritual and canon law the Latin or Roman <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> formed the West. In a still broader sense the East may be called Greek. True, many Eastern Churches <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of Greek; the oldest (<a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>) have never used Greek liturgically nor for their literature; nevertheless they too depend in some sense on a Greek tradition. Whereas our <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a> have never concerned them at all (most Eastern Christians have never even heard of our <a href="13548a.htm">schoolmen</a> or canonists), they still feel the influence of the Greek <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, their <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> is still concerned about controversies carried on originally in Greek and settled by Greek <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>. The literature of those that do not use Greek is formed on Greek models, is full of words carefully chosen or composed to correspond to some technical Greek distinction, then, in the broadest terms, is: that a <a href="09022a.htm">Western Church</a> is one originally dependent on <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whose traditions are Latin; an Eastern Church looks rather to Constantinople (either as a friend or an enemy) and inherits Greek <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>.</p>

<p>The point may be stated more scientifically by using the old division of the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>. Originally (e.g. at the <a href="11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, A.D. 325, can. vi) there were three <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>, those of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Alexandria, and Antioch. Further legislation formed two more at the expense of Antioch: Constantinople in 381 and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 451. In any case the Roman <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> was always enormously the greatest. <em><a href="09022a.htm">Western Christendom</a> may be defined quite simply as the Roman <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and all Churches that have broken away from it. All the others, with <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> bodies formed from them, make up the Eastern half.</em> But it must not be imaged that either half is in any sense one Church. The Latin half was so (in spite of a few unimportant <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a>) till the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. To find a time when there was one Eastern Church we must go back to the centuries before the Council of Ephesus (431). Since that council there have been separate <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Eastern Churches whose number has grown steadily down to our own time. The <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> left a permanent <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church, the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> and <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> quarrels made several more, the reunion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> of fractions of every Rite further increased the number, and quite lately the <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> has created yet another; indeed it seems as if two more, in <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, are being formed at the present moment (1908).</p>

<p>We have now a general criterion by which to answer the question: What is an Eastern Church? Looking at a map, we see that, roughly, the division between the Roman <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and the others forms a line that runs down somewhat to the east of the River Vistula (Poland is Latin), then comes back above the Danube, to continue down the Adriatic Sea, and finally divides Africa west of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Illyricum (Macedonia and Greece) once belonged to the Roman <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, and Greater Greece (Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>) was intermittently Byzantine. But both these lands eventually fell back into the branches that surrounded them (except for the thin remnant of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Italo-Greeks). We may, then, say that any ancient Church east of that line is an Eastern Church. To these we must add those formed by missionaries (especially Russians) from one of these Churches. Later Latin and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missions have further complicated the tangled state of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> East. Their adherents everywhere belong of course to the Western portion.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section2">Catalogue of the Eastern Churches</h2>

<p>It is now possible to draw up the list of bodies that answer to our definition. We have already noted that they are by no means all in communion with each other, nor have they any common basis of language, rite or <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. All are covered by a division into the great <em>Orthodox Church</em>, those formed by the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> (the original <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelites</a> are now all Eastern-Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>), and lastly the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a> corresponding in each case to a <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> body. Theologically, to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the vital distinction is between Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, on the one hand, and schismatics or <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>, on the other. But it is not convenient to start from this basis in cataloguing Eastern Churches. Historically and <a href="03705a.htm">archeologically</a>, it is a secondary question. Each <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body has been formed from one of the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> ones; their organizations are comparatively late, dating in most cases from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Moreover, although all these Eastern-Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of course agrees in the same <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> we profess, they are not organized as one body. Each branch keeps the rites (with in some cases modifications made at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for dogmatic reasons) of the corresponding <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> body, and has an organization modelled on the same plan. In <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, for instance, is joined to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chaldees and <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>, and has no more to do with the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> than with <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> or <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>. Nor does he forget this fact. He knows quite well that he is a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in union with the Pope of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that he is equally in union with every other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Nevertheless, national customs, languages, and rites tell very strongly on the superficies, and our <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> would certainly feel very much more at home in a non-Catholic church of his own nation than in a Coptic <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, or even Latin, church. Outwardly, the bond of a common language and common liturgy is often the essential and radical division of a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Indeed these Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bodies in many cases still faintly reflect the divisions of their <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> relations. What in one case is a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> (as for instance between Orthodox and <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>) still remains as a not very friendly feeling between the different Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches (in this case Melkites and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrians). Certainly, such feeling is a very different thing from formal <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, and the leaders of the Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches, we well as all their more intelligent members and all their well-wishers, earnestly strive to repress it. Nevertheless, quarrels between various Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bodies fill up too large a portion of Eastern Church history to be ignored; still, to take another instance, anyone who knows <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> knows that the friendship between Melkites and <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> is not enthusiastic. It will be seen, then, that for purposes of tabulation we cannot conveniently begin by cataloguing the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bodies on the one side and then classing the schismatics together on the other. We must arrange these Churches according to their historical basis and origin: first, the larger and older <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Churches; then, side by side with each of these, the corresponding Eastern-Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> formed out of the schismatics in later times.</p>

<h3 id="A">Schismatical Churches</h3>

<p><em>1. Orthodox</em></p>

<p>The first of the Eastern Churches in size and importance is the great <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. This is, after that of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, considerably the largest body in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. The <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> now counts about a hundred millions of members. It is the main body of Eastern Christendom, that remained faithful to the decrees of Ephesus and Chalcedon when <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> cut away the national Churches in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. It remained in union with the West till the great <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> of Photius and then that of <a href="10273a.htm">Caerularius</a>, in the ninth and eleventh centuries. In spite of the short-lived reunions made by the <a href="09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a> (1274) and the <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (1439), this Church has been in <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> ever since. The "Orthodox" (it is convenient as well as courteous to call them by the name they use as a technical one for themselves) originally comprised the four Eastern <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>: Alexandria and Antioch, then Constantinople and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. But the balance between these four <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> was soon upset. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> was taken away from Antioch and made autocephalous (i.e., extra-patriarchal) by the Council of Ephesus (431). Then, in the fifth century, came the great upheavals of <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, of which the result was that enormous numbers of <a href="14399a.htm">Syrians</a> and Egyptians fell away into <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. So the Patriarchs of Antioch, <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (this was always a very small and comparatively unimportant centre), and Alexandria, losing most of its subjects, inevitably sank in importance. The <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a> conquest of their lands completed their ruin, so that they became the merest shadows of what their predecessors had once been. Meanwhile Constantinople, <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> by the presence of the emperor, and always sure of his favour, rose rapidly in importance. Itself a new see, neither Apostolic nor primitive (the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Byzantium was Metrophanes in 325), it succeeded so well in its ambitious career that for a short time after the <a href="13535a.htm">great Eastern schism</a> it seemed as if the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the New Rome would take the same place over the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> as did his rival the Pope of the Old <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> over <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It is also well known that it was this insatiable <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> of Constantinople that was chiefly responsible for the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> of the ninth and eleventh centuries. The <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquest, strangely enough, still further strengthened the power of the Byzantine patriarch, inasmuch as the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> acknowledged him as the civil head of what they called the "Roman nation" (<em>Rum millet</em>), meaning thereby the whole Orthodox community of whatever <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. For about a century Constantinople enjoyed her power. The other <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> were content to be her vassals, many of them even came to spend their useless lives as ornaments of the chief patriarch's court, while <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> protested faintly and ineffectually that she was subject to no patriarch. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> who had climbed to so high a place by a long course of degrading intrigue could for a little time justify in the Orthodox world his usurped title of Ecumenical Patriarch. Then came his fall; since the sixteenth century he has lost one province after another, till now he too is only a shadow of what he once was, and the real power of the Orthodox body is in the new independent national Churches with their "holy Synods"; while high over all looms the shadow of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. The separation of the various national Orthodox Churches from the patriarch of Constantinople forms the only important chapter in the modern history of this body. The principle is always the same. More and more has the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> obtained that political modifications should be followed by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, that is to say that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of an independent State must be itself independent of the patriarch. This by no means implies real independence for the national Church; on the contrary, in each case the much severer rule of the Government is substituted for the distant authority of the Ecumenical Patriarch. Outside the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire, in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> and the Balkan States, the Orthodox Churches are shamelessly Erastian &#151; by far the most Erastian of all <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> bodies. The process began when the great Church of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> was declared autocephalous by the Czar Feodor Ivanovitch, in 1589. Jeremias II of Constantinople took a <a href="02778c.htm">bribe</a> to acknowledge its independence. Peter the Great abolished the Russian <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> (of <a href="10591b.htm">Moscow</a>) and set up a "Holy Governing Synod" to rule the national Church in 1721. The Holy Synod is simply a department of the government through which the czar rules over his Church as absolutely as over his army and navy. The independence of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> and its Holy Synod has since been copied by each Balkan State. But this independence does not mean <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Its first announcement is naturally very distasteful to the patriarch and his court. He often begins by <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> the new national Church root and branch. But in each case he has been <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give in finally and to acknowledge one more "Sister in Christ" in the Holy Synod that has displaced his authority. Only in the specially difficult and bitter case of the <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Church has a permanent <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> resulted. Other causes have led to the establishment of a few other independent Churches, so that now the great Orthodox communion consists of sixteen independent Churches, each of which (except that of the Bulgars) is recognized by, and in communion with, the others.</p>

Under the Ecumenical Patriarch are seventy-four <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and twenty other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Outside this territory the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople has no <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. He still has the position of civil head of the Roman Nation throughout the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Empire, and he still intermittently tries to interpret this as including some sort of <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> &#151; he is doing so at this moment in <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> &#151; but in modern times especially each attempt is at once met by the most pronounced opposition on the part of the other <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and national Churches, who answer that they acknowledge no head by Christ, no external authority but the seven Ecumenical Synods. The Ecumenical Patriarch, however, keeps the right of alone consecrating the <a href="03696b.htm">chrism</a> (<em>myron</em>) and sending it to the other Orthodox Churches, except in the cases of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> and Rumania, which prepare it themselves. <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> gets hers from <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Greece has already mooted the question of consecrating her own <em>myron</em>, and there seems to be no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Antioch will do so too when the present stock is exhausted.

<p>This ends the list of allied bodies that make up the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. Next come, in order of <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, the old <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> Eastern Churches.</p>

<p><em>2. Nestorians</em></p>

<p>The <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> are now only a pitiful remnant of what was once a great Church. Long before the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> from which they have their name, there was a flourishing <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community in Chaldea and Mesopotamia. According to their tradition it was founded by Addai and Mari (Addeus and Maris), two of the seventy-two Disciples. The present <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> count Mar Mari as the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ctesiphon and predecessor of their patriarch. In any case this community was originally subject to the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. As his vicar, the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the twin-cities of <a href="13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> and Ctesiphon (on either side of the Tigris, north-east of Babylon) bore the title of <a href="03454a.htm">catholicos</a>. One of these <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> was present at the <a href="11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> in 325. The great distance of this Church from Antioch led in early times to a state of semi-independence that prepared the way for the later <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Already in the fourth century the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> waived his right of ordaining the <a href="03454a.htm">catholicos</a> of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, and allowed him to be <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> by his own suffragans. In view of the great importance of the right of ordaining, as a sign of <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> throughout the East, this fact is important. But it does not seem that real independence of Antioch was acknowledged or even claimed till after the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. In the fifth century the influence of the famous <a href="14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> and that of his <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> spread the <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Nestorius throughout this extreme Eastern Church. Naturally, the later <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> deny that their fathers accepted any new <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> at that time, and they claim that Nestorius learned from them rather than they from him ("Nestorius eos secutus est, non ipsi Nestorium", Ebed-Jesu of <a href="11084c.htm">Nisibis</a>, about 1300. Assemani, "Bibli. Orient.", III, 1, 355). There may be <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> in this. Theodore and his <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> had certainly prepared the way for Nestorius. In any case the rejection of the Council of Ephesus (431) by these <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Chaldea and Mesopotamia produced a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> between them and the rest of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. When Babaeus, himself a <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, became <a href="03454a.htm">catholicos</a>, in 498, there were practically no more <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in those parts. From Ctesiphon the Faith had spread across the frontier into <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>, even before that city was conquered by the Persian king (244). The Persian Church, then, always depended on Ctesiphon and shared its <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. From the fifth century this most remote of the Eastern Churches has been cut off from the rest of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and till modern times was the most separate and forgotten community of all. Shut out from the Roman Empire (Zeno closed the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="05282a.htm">Edessa</a> in 489), but, for a time at least, protected by the Persian kings, the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church flourished around Ctesiphon, Nisibis (where the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> was reorganized), and throughout <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Since the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> the <a href="03454a.htm">catholicos</a> occasionally assumed the title of patriarch. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> then spread towards the East and sent missionaries to <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> and even <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>. A <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> inscription of the year 781 has been found at Singan Fu in <a href="03663b.htm">China</a> (J. Heller, S.J., "Prolegomena zu einer neuen Ausgabe der nestorianischen Inschrift von Singan Fu", in the "Verhandlungen des VII. internationalen Orientalistencongresses", <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1886, pp. 37 sp.). Its greatest extent was in the eleventh century, when twenty-five <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> obeyed the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> patriarch. But since the end of the fourteenth century it has gradually sunk to a very small <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, first, because of a fierce <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> by the Mongols (Timur Leng), and then through internal disputes and <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a>. Two great <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a> as to the patriarchal succession in the sixteenth century led to a reunion of part of the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, forming the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Chaldean Church. At present there are about 150,000 <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> living chiefly in highlands west of Lake Urumiah. They speak a modern dialect of Syriac. The <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> descends from uncle to nephew, or to younger brothers, in the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Mama; each patriarch bears the name Simon (Mar Shimun) as a title. Ignoring the Second General Council, and of course strongly opposed to the Third (Ephesus), they only acknowledge the First Nicene (325). They have a Creed of their own, formed from an old Antiochene Creed, which does not contain any trace of the particular <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> from which their Church is named. Indeed it is difficult to say how far any <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> now are conscious of the particular teaching condemned by the Council of Ephesus, though they still <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> Nestorius, <a href="14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, and other undoubted <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> as <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>. The patriarch rules over twelve other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (the list in Silbernagl, "Verfassung", p. 267). Their <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> consists of the patriarch, <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>, <a href="01693a.htm">archdeacons</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, and readers. There are also many <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. They use Syriac liturgically written in their own (<a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>) form of the alphabet. The patriarch, who now generally calls himself "<a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the East", resides at Kochanes, a remote valley of the Kurdish mountains by the Zab, on the frontier between <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a> and Turkey. He has an undefined political jurisdiction over his people, though he does not receive a berat from the Sultan. In any ways this most remote Church stands alone; it has kept a number of curious and archaic customs (such as the perpetual abstinence of the patriarch, etc.) that separate it from other Eastern Churches almost as much as from those of the West. Lately the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury's</a> mission to the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> has aroused a certain interest about them in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>.</p>

<p>All the other <a href="13529a.htm">separated</a> Eastern Churches are formed by the other great <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the fourth century, <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>. There are first the national <a href="03744a.htm">Churches</a> of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>.</p>

<p><em>3. Copts</em></p>

<p>The <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> form the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> was in a special sense the national religion of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. As an extreme opposition to <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, the Egyptians believed it to be the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of their hero <a href="04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (d. 444). His successor, <a href="05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a> (444-55), was deposed and <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the Council of Chalcedon (451). From his time the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> party gained ground very quickly among the native population, so that soon it became an expression of their national feeling against the Imperial (Melchite, or Melkite) garrison and government officials. Afterwards, at the <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a> invasion (641), the opposition was so strong that the native Egyptians threw in their lot with the conquerors against the Greeks. The two sides are still represented by the native <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and the Orthodox minority. The <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> are sometimes called <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> here as in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>; but the old national name <em>Copt</em> (Gr. <em>Aigyptios</em>) has become the regular one for their Church as well as for their nation. Their patriarch, with the title of Alexandria, succeeds <a href="05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a> and Timothy the Cat, a fanatical <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>. He lives at Cairo, ruling over thirteen <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and about 500,000 subjects. For him, too, the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> is perpetual abstinence. There are many <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> use their old language liturgically and have in it a number of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a> all derived from the original <a href="06774a.htm">Greek rite</a> of Alexandria (St. Mark). But Coptic is a dead language, so much so that even most <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> understand very little of it. They all speak Arabic, and their service books give an Arabic version of the text in parallel columns. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is, on the whole, in a poor state. The <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> are mostly fellaheen who live by tilling the ground, in a state of great poverty and <a href="07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. And the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> share the same conditions. Lately there have been something of a revival among them, and certain rich Coptic merchants of Cairo have begun to found <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and generally to promote <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and such advantages among their nation. One of these, M. Gabriel Labib, who is editing their service books, promises to be a scholar of some distinction in questions of liturgy and archeology.</p>

<p><em>4. Abyssinians</em></p>

<p>The Church of <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, or <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, always depended on <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. It was founded by St. Frumentius, who was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> and sent by <a href="02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> in 326. So <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> has always acknowledged the supremacy of the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, and still considers its Church as a daughter-church of the See of St. Mark. The same causes that made <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> affected <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> equally. She naturally, almost inevitably, shared the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> of the mother Church. So <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> is still <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, and acknowledges the Coptic patriarch as her head. There is now only one <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> (there were once two) who is called <em>Abuna</em> (Our Father) and resides at Adeva (the old see of <a href="02163a.htm">Axum</a>). He is always a <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and sent by the Coptic patriarch. It does not seem, however, that there is now much communication between Cairo and Adeva, though the patriarch still has the right of deposing the Abuna. <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a> has about three million inhabitants, nearly all members of the national Church. There are many <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and an enormous number of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, whom the Abuna ordains practically without any previous preparation or examination. The <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> have <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, again, derived from those of Alexandria in the old (classical) form of their language. The <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Church, being the religion of more than half barbarous people, cut off by the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> from relations with any other <a href="03744a.htm">Christian body</a> except the poor and backward <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>, is certainly the lowest representative of the <a href="03744a.htm">great Christian family</a>. The people have gradually mixed up <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with a number of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and magical elements, and are specially noted for strong Jewish tendencies (they <a href="03777a.htm">circumcise</a> and have on their altars a sort of <a href="01721a.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a> containing the <a href="04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a>). Lately <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> has developed an interest in the <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> and has begun to undertake schemes for <a href="05295b.htm">educating</a> them, and, of course, at the same time, converting them to Orthodoxy.</p>

<p><em>5. Jacobites</em></p>

<p>The <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> are the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Here, too, chiefly out of political opposition to the imperial court, <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> spread quickly among the native population, and here, too, there was the same opposition between the Syrian <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> in the country and the Greek Melkites in the cities. Severus of Antioch (512-18) was an ardent <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>. After his death the Emperor Justinian (527-65) tried to cut off the succession by having all <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> suspect of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> locked up in <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. But his wife Theodora was herself a <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>; he arranged the <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a> of two <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of that party, Theodore and James. It was from this James, called Zanzalos and Barada&iuml; (Jacob Barad&aelig;us), that they have their name (<em>Ia'qobaie</em>, "Jacobite"); it is sometimes used for any <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> anywhere, but had better be kept for the national Syrian Church. James found two <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who with him <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> a whole <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, including one Sergius of Tella as <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. From this Sergius the Jacobite <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> descend. Historically, the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> are the national Church of their country, as much as the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; but they by no means form so exclusively the religion of the native population. <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> never held together, was never so compact a unity as <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. We have seen that the Eastern Syrians expressed their national, anti-Imperial feeling by adopting the extreme opposite <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, which, however, had the same advantage of not being the religion of Caesar and his court. Among the Western Syrians, too, there has always been a lack of cohesion. They had in <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> times two <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> (Antioch and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>) instead of one. In all quarrels, whether political or <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, whereas the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> move like one man for the cause of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the "Christian Pharaoh", the Syrians are divided amongst themselves. So there have always been many more Melkites in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> were never an overwhelming majority. Now they are a small minority (about 80,000) dwelling in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Mesopotamia, Kurdistan. Their head is the Jacobite <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of "Antioch and all the East". He always takes the name Ignatius and dwells either at Diarbekir or Mardin in Mesopotamia. Under him, as first of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, is the Maphrian, a <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> who was originally set up to rule the Eastern <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> as a rival of the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="03454a.htm">catholicos</a>. Originally the maphrian had a number of special <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges that made him almost independent of his patriarch. Now he has only precedence of other <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, a few <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> in connection with the patriarch's election and <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> (when the patriarch dies he is generally succeeded by the maphrian) and the title "Maphrian and <a href="03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of the East". Besides these two, the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> have seven <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and three other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. As in all Eastern Churches, there are many <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, from whom the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are always taken. The Syrian <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> are in communion with the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>. They name the Coptic patriarch in the Liturgy, and the rule is that each Syrian patriarch should send an official letter to his brother of Alexandria to announce his succession. This implies a recognition of superior rank which is consistent with the old precedence of Alexandria over Antioch. At Mardin still linger the remains of an old <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> community of Sun-worshippers who in 1762 (when the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> finally decided to apply to them, too, the extermination that the <a href="08692a.htm">Koran</a> prescribes for <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a>) preferred to hide under the outward appearance of <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobite Christianity</a>. They were, therefore, all nominally converted, and they conform the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobite Church</a>, <a href="02258b.htm">baptize</a>, fast, receive all <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and <a href="03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>. But they only marry among themselves and every one knows that they still practise their old <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> rites in secret. There are about one hundred <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of these people, still called <em>Shamsiyeh</em> (people of the Sun).</p>

<p><em>6. Malabar Christians</em></p>

<p>The <a href="14678a.htm">Malabar Christians</a> in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> have had the strangest history of all these Eastern Churches. For, having been <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, they have now veered round to the other extreme and have become <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. We hear of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities along the Malabar coast (in Southern <a href="07722a.htm">India</a> from <a href="06602a.htm">Goa</a> to Cape Comorin) as early as the sixth century. They claim the Apostle of St. Thomas as their founder (hence their name "Thomas Christians", or "Christians of St. Thomas"). In the first period they depended on the <a href="03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, and were <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> like him. They are really one of the many missionary Churches founded by the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> in <a href="01777b.htm">Asia</a>. In the sixteenth century the <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> succeeded in converting a part of this Church to reunion in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. A further <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> among these Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> led to a complicated situation, of which the Jacobite patriarch took advantage by sending a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> to form a Jacobite Malabar Church. There were then three parties among them: <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The line of <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> died out (it has been revived lately) and nearly all the non-Catholic <a href="14678a.htm">Thomas Christians</a> may be counted as <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> since the eighteenth century. But the Jacobite patriarch seems to have forgotten them, so that after 1751 they chose their own <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and were an independent Church. In the nineteenth century, after they had been practically rediscovered by the English, the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> tried to reassert authority over Malabar by sending out a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> named <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> made a considerable disturbance, <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> he found, and tried to reorganize this Church in communion with the Syrian patriarch. But the Rajah of Travancore took the side of the national Church and forced <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> to leave the county. Since then the <a href="14678a.htm">Thomas Christians</a> have been a quite independent Church whose communion with the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> of <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> is at most only theoretic. There are about 70,000 of them under a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> who calls himself "Bishop and Gate of all <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>". He is always named by his predecessor, i.e. each <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chooses a coadjutor with the right of succession. The <a href="14678a.htm">Thomas Christians</a> use Syriac liturgically and describe themselves generally as "Syrians".</p>

<p><em>7. Armenians</em></p>

<p>The <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church is the last and the most important of these <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> bodies. Although it agrees in <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> with the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a> and <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, it is not communion with them (a union arranged by a synod in 726 came to nothing) nor with any other Church in the world. This is a national Church in the strictest sense of all: except for the large <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body that forms the usual pendant, and for a very small number of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, every <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> belongs to it, and it has no members who are not <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. So in this case the name of the national and of the religion are really the same. Only, since there are the Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to distinguish whether an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> belongs to them or to the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> (<a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>) Church. Because of this distinction it is usual to call the others Gregorian <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> &#151; after <a href="07023a.htm">St. Gregory the Illuminator</a> &#151; another polite concession of form on our part akin to that of "Orthodox" etc. Quite lately the Gregorian <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have begun to call themselves Orthodox. This has no meaning and only confuses the issue. Of course each Church thinks itself really Orthodox, and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic and Holy too. But one must keep technical names clear, or we shall always talk at cross purposes. The polite convention throughout the Levant is that we are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, that people in communion with the "Ecumenical Patriarch" are Orthodox, and that <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> are Gregorian. They should be content with that is an honourable title to which we and the Orthodox do not of course think that they have really any right. They have no real right to it, because the Apostle of <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="07023a.htm">St. Gregory the Illuminator</a> (295), was no <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, but a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church was in the first period subject to the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Caesarea; he <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> its <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It suffered <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> from the <a href="11712a.htm">Persians</a> and was an <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> branch of the great <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> till the sixth century. Then <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> spread through <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a> from <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and in 527 the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a>, <a href="10754a.htm">Nerses</a>, in the Synod of Duin, formally rejected the Council of Chalcedon. The <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> was quite manifest in 552, when the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a>, Abraham I, <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Georgia and all others who accepted the decrees of Chalcedon. From that time the national <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church has been isolated from the rest of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>; the continual attempts at reunion made by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries, however, have established a considerable body of <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> are a prolific and widespread race. They are found not only in <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, but scattered all over the Levant and in many cities of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> and America. As they always bring their Church with them, it is a large and important community, second only to the Orthodox in size among Eastern Churches. There are about three millions of Gregorian <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. Among their <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> four have the title of patriarch. The first is the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Etchmiadzin, who bears as a special title that of <em>catholicos</em>. Etchmiadzin is a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the province of Erivan, between the Black and the Caspian Seas, near Mount Ararat (since 1828 Russian territory). It is the cradle of the race and their chief sanctuary. The <a href="03454a.htm">catholicos</a> is the head of the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a> Church and to a great extent of his nation too. Before the Russian occupation of Erivan he had unlimited <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all Georgian <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and was something very like an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. But since he sits under the shadow of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and especially since the Russian Government has begun to interfere in his election and administration, the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> of Turkey have made themselves nearly independent of him. The second rank belongs to the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople.They have had a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Constantinople since 1307. In 1461 Mohammed II gave this <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> the title of <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, so as to rivet their loyalty to his capital and to form a <em>millet</em> (nation) on the same footing as the <em>Rum millet</em> (the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>). This patriarch is the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> responsible to the Porte for his race, has the same privileges as his Orthodox rival, and now uses the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> that formerly belonged to the <a href="03454a.htm">catholicos</a>. Under him, and little more than titular <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, are those of Sis in Cilicia (a title kept after a temporary <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> in 1440 and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (whose title was assumed illegally in the eighteenth century). The <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have seven <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the Russian Empire, two in <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and thirty-five in Turkey. They distinguish <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> from <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> by an honorary precedence only and have an upper class of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> called Vartapeds, who are <a href="03481a.htm">celibate</a> and provide all the higher offices (<a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are always taken from their ranks). There are, of course, as in all Eastern Churches, many <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. In many ways the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> (Gregorian) Church has been influenced by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so that they are among Eastern <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> bodies the only one that can be described as at all latinized. Examples of such influence are their use of unleavened bread for the <a href="05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, their vestments (the <a href="10404a.htm">mitre</a> is almost exactly the Roman one), etc. This appears to be the result of opposition to their nearer rivals, the Orthodox. In any case, at present the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> are probably nearer to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and better disposed for reunion than any other of these communions. Their <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a> is now very vague and shadowy &#151; as indeed is the case with most <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Churches. It is from them that the greatest proportion of Eastern-Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have been converted.</p>

<p>This brings us to the end of the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> bodies and so to the end of all <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Eastern Churches. A further <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> was indeed caused by the <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelite heresy</a> in the seventh century, but the whole of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> then formed (the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Church) has been for many centuries reunited with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. So <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> have their place only among the Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<h3 id="catholic">Eastern Catholic Churches</h3>

<p>The definition of an Eastern-Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is: <em>A <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> of any Eastern rite in union with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a></em>: i.e. a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who belongs not to the Roman, but to an Eastern rite. They differ from other Eastern Christians in that they are in communion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and from Latins in that they have other rites.</p>

<p>A curious, but entirely theoretic, question of terminology is: Are <a href="10298a.htm">Milanese</a> and Mozarabic considered Eastern Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>? If we make rite our basis, they are. That is, they are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who do not belong to the <a href="13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>. The point has sometimes been urged rather as a catch than seriously. As a matter of fact, the real basis, though it is superficially less obvious than rite, is <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. Eastern-Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who do not belong to the Roman <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. So these two remnants of other rites in the West do not constitute Eastern-Rite Churches. In the West, rite does not always follow <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>; the great Gallican Church, with her own rite, was always part of the Roman <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>; so are <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and Toledo. This, however, raises a new difficulty; for it may be urged that in that case the Italo-Greeks are not Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, since they certainly belong to the Roman <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. They do, of course; and they always have done so legally. But the constitution of these Italo-Greek Churches was originally the result of an attempt on the part of the Eastern emperors (<a href="09157b.htm">Leo III</a>, 717-741, especially; see "Orth. Eastern Church", 45-47) to filch them from the Roman <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> and join them to that of Constantinople. Although the attempt did not succeed, the descendants of the Greeks in Calabria, <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, etc., have kept the Byzantine Rite. They are an exception to the rule, invariable in the East, that rite follows <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, and are an exception to the general principle about <a href="04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a> too. As they have no <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their own, on this ground it may well be denied that they form a Church. An Italo-Greek may best be defined as a member of the Roman <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, or <a href="04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, who, as a memory of older arrangements, is still allowed to use the Byzantine Rite. With regard to the fundamental distinction of <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, it must be noted that it is no longer purely geographical. A Latin in the East belongs to the Roman patriarch as much as if he lived in the West; Latin missionaries everywhere and the newer <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="02113b.htm">Australia</a> and American count as part of what was once the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Western <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. So also the Melkites in <a href="09131a.htm">Leghorn</a>, <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> belong to the Byzantine <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, though, as foreigners, they are temporarily subject to <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<p>A short enumeration and description of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a> will complete this picture of the Eastern Churches. It is, in the first place, a mistake (encouraged by <a href="11329a.htm">Eastern schismatics</a> and <a href="01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>) to look upon these <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a> as a sort of compromise between Latin and other rites, or between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and schismatics. Nor is it <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that they are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to whom grudging leave has been given to keep something of their national customs. Their position is quite simple and quite <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a>. They represent exactly the state of the Eastern Churches before the <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a>. They are entirely and uncompromisingly <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in our strictest sense of the word, quite as much as Latins. They accept the whole <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> and the authority of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as visible head of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, as did St. Athanasius, <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>. They do not belong to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, nor do they use his rite, any more than did the great <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> of Eastern Christendom. They have their own rites and their own <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, as had their fathers before the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Nor is there any <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of compromise or concession about this. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has never been identified with the Western <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> position as patriarch of the West is as distinct from his <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> as is his authority as local <a href="12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. It is no more <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to belong to his <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> in order to acknowledge his supreme <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> that it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to have him for <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches in union with the West have always been as much the ideal of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> Universal as the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. If some of those Eastern Churches fall into <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, that is a misfortune which does not affect the others who remain faithful. If all fall away, the Eastern half of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> disappears for a time as an actual fact; it remains as a theory and an ideal to be realized again as soon as they, or some of them, come back to union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<p>This is what has happened. There is at any rate no certain evidence of continuity from time before the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> in any of these Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches. Through the bad time, from the various <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a> to the sixteenth and seventh centuries, there are traces, isolated cases, of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have at least wished for reunion with the West; but it cannot be claimed that any considerable body of Eastern Christians have kept the union throughout. The <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> think they have, but they are mistaken; the only real case is that of the Italo-Greeks (who have never been <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a>). Really the Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches were formed by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries since the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. And as soon as any number of Eastern Christians were persuaded to reunite with the West, the situation that had existed before the <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a> became an actual one again. They became <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; no one thought of asking them to become Latins. They were given <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of their own as successors of the old <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Eastern <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> before the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, and they became what all Eastern Christians had once been &#151; <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. That the Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are comparatively small bodies is the unfortunate result of the fact that the majority of their countrymen prefer <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. Our missionaries would willingly make them larger ones. But, juridically, they stand exactly where all the East once stood, before the <a href="13535a.htm">Greek schism</a>, or during the short-lived union of Florence (1439-53). And they have as much right to exist and be respected as have Latins, or the great <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the East had during the first centuries. The <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of latinizing all Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, sometimes defended by people on our side whose <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for uniformity is greater than their <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the historical and juridical situation, is diametrically opposed to antiquity, to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization, and to the policy of all <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. Nor has it any hope of success. The East may become <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> again; it will never be what it never has been &#151; Latin.</p>

<p><em>1. Byzantine Catholics</em></p>

<p>1. The Byzantine <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are those who correspond to the Orthodox. They all use the same (Byzantine) Rite; but they are not all organized as one body. They form seven groups:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the Melkites in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (about 110,000), under a <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> who administers, and bears the titles of, Alexandria and <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> too. They have eleven <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and use Arabic liturgically with fragments Greek, though any of their <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> may (and some do) celebrate entirely in Greek. The old name "Melkite", which meant originally one who accepted the decrees of Chalcedon (and the imperial <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>), as against the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> and <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>, is now used only for these <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</li><li>There are a few hundred <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of this Rite in <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a> and Turkey in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. They use Greek liturgically and depend on Latin delegates at Constantinople and <a href="02046a.htm">Athens</a>.</li><li>One Georgian congregation of Constantinople (last remnant of the old Georgian Church destroyed by <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>), who use their own language and obey the Latin Delegate.</li><li>The <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, of whom there are nearly four millions in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> and hidden still in corners of <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. They use Old Slavonic.</li><li>The <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (about 13,000), under two <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, who also use old Slavonic.</li><li>Rumanian <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (about a million and a half) in <a href="13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, but chiefly in <a href="15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>. They have <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and use their own language in the liturgy.</li><li>The Italo-Greeks (about 50,000), a remnant of the old Church of Greater Greece. They are scattered about Calabria and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, have a famous <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Grotta-ferrata) and colonies at <a href="09131a.htm">Leghorn</a>, <a href="09574a.htm">Malta</a>, <a href="01311a.htm">Algiers</a>, <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and <a href="04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, besides a church (St-Julien le Pauvre) at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>. They use Greek liturgically but, living as they do surrounded by Latins, they have considerably latinized their rites. </li></ul></div>

<p>This completes the list of Byzantine <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, of whom it may be said that the chief want is organization among themselves. There has often been talk of restoring a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> (Melkite) <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. It was said that <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> intended to arrange this before he died. If such a revival ever is made, the patriarch would have <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, or at least a primacy, over all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of his Rite; in this way the scattered unities of Melkites in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> in <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, Italo-Greeks in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and so on, would be linked together as are all other Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches.</p>

<p><em>2. Chaldean Catholics</em></p>

<p>The Chaldees are Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> converted from <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a complicated series of quarrels and <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a> among the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> led to not very stable unions of first one and then another party with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Since that time there has always been a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> patriarch of the Chaldees, though several times the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> so appointed fell away into <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> again and had to be replaced by another. The Chaldees are said now to number about 70,000 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> (Silbernagl, op. cit., 354; but Werner, "Orbis Terr. Cath.", 166, gives the number as 33,000). Their <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> lives at Mosul, having the title of <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Babylon. Under him are two archbishoprics and ten other <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>. There are <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> whose arrangements are very similar to those of the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>. The <a href="09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> (in Syriac, slightly revised from the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> ones) are printed by the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Mosul. Most of their canon law depends on the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, "Reversurus" (12 July, 1867), published for the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and extended to the Chaldees by another <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Cum ecclesiastica" (31 Aug., 1869). They have some students at the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> College in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<p><em>3. Alexandrian Catholics</em></p>

<p>The Alexandrian <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (Catholic <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>) have had a <a href="15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> since 1781. Before that (in 1442 and again in 1713) the Coptic patriarch had submitted to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but in neither case was the union of long duration. As the number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of this Rite has increased very considerably of late years, <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1895 restored the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. The patriarch lives at Cairo and rules over about 20,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>.</p>

<p><em>4. Abyssinians</em></p>

<p>The <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>, too, had many relations with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in past times, and Latin missionaries built up a considerable <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Church. But repeated persecutions and banishment of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> prevented this community from becoming a permanent one with a regular <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Now that the Government is tolerant, some thousands of <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. They have an Apostolic vicar at Keren. If their numbers increase, no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> they will in time be organized under a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Abuna who should depend on the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Coptic patriarch. Their liturgy, too, is at present in a state of disorganization. It seems that the <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> books will need a good deal of revision before they can be used by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> for this rite have a translation of the Roman Mass in their own language, an arrangement that is not meant to be more than a temporary expedient.</p>

<p><em>5. Syrians</em></p>

<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrian Church dates from 1781. At that time a number of Jacobite <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and lay people, who had agreed to reunion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, elected one Ignatius Giarve to succeed the dead Jacobite patriarch, George III. Giarve sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> asking for recognition and a <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a>, and submitting in all things to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority. But he was then deposed by those of his people who clung to Jacobitism, and a Jacobite patriarch was elected. From this time there have been two rival successions. In 1830 the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Syrians were acknowledged by the <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Government as a separate <em>millet</em>. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> patriarch lives at <a href="02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, most of his flock in Mesopotamia. Under him are three <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and six other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, five <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and about 25,000 <a href="05782a.htm">families</a>.</p>

<p><em>6. Uniat Church of Malabar</em></p>

<p>There is also a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Malabar formed by the Synod of Diamper in 1599. This Church, too, has passed through stormy periods; quite lately, since the <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, a new <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> has been formed form it of about 30,000 people who are in communion with neither the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, nor the <a href="14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, nor the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, nor any one else at all. There are now about 200,000 Malabar <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> under three <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> (at Trichur, Changanacherry, and Ernaculam).</p>

<p><em>7. Armenians</em></p>

<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> are an important body numbering altogether about 130,000 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. Like their Gregorian countrymen they are scattered about the Levant, and they have congregations in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. There have been several more or less temporary reunions of the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church since the fourteenth century, but in each case a rival Gregorian party set up rival <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The head of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> is the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (since 1830), in whom is joined the <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of Cilicia. He always takes the name Peter, and rules over three titular <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and fourteen sees, of which one is Alexandria and one Ispahan in <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a> (Werner-- Silbernagl, 346). After much dispute he is now recognized by the Porte as the head of a separate <em>millet</em>, and he also represents before the Government all other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bodies that have as yet no political organization. There are also many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> who are subject in <a href="15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> to the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but in Galicia to the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>. In <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> there is an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01765a.htm">See of Artvin</a> <a href="05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a> (Founded by Mechitar of <a href="13667a.htm">Sebaste</a> in 1711) are an important element of <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. They are <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who follow the <a href="02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> and have <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at San Lazzaro outside <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>, at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and in many towns in the Balkans, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, and <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>. They have missions all over the Levant, <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and presses that produce important <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, historical, historical, and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works. Since 1869 all <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> must be <a href="03481a.htm">celibate</a>.</p>

<p><em>8. Maronites</em></p>

<p>Lastly, the <em><a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Church</em> is entirely <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. There is much dispute as to its origin and the reason of its separation from the Syrian national Church. It is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that it was formed around <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the Lebanon founded by a certain John Maro in the fourth century. In spite of the indignant protests of all <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> there is no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they were separated from the old See of Antioch by the fact that they were <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>. They were reunited to the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in the twelfth century, and then (after a period of wavering) since 1216, when their patriarch, Jeremias II, made his definite submission, they have been unswervingly faithful, alone among all Eastern Churches. As in other cases, the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, too, are allowed to keep their old organization and titles. Their head is the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a> "Patriarch of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and all the East", successor to <a href="10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> rivals of the old line, who, therefore, in no way represents the original <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. He is also the civil head of his nation, although he has no <em>berat</em> from the sultan, and lives in a large palace at Bkerki in the Lebanon. He has under him nine sees and several <a href="08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. There are many <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>. The present law of the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Church was drawn up by the great national council held in 1736 at the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Our Lady of the Almond Trees (Deir Sa&iuml;dat al-Luaize), in the Lebanon. There are about 300,000 <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> in the Lebanon and scattered along the <a href="14399a.htm">Syrian</a> coast. They also have colonies in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and numbers of them have lately begun to <a href="10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to America. They have a national college at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This completes the list of all the Eastern Churches, whether <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> or <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.</p>

<p>In considering their general characteristics we must first of all again separate the Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the others. Eastern Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and have as much right to be so treated as Latins. As far as <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> go they must be numbered with us; as far as the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of an Eastern Church may now seem to connote <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> or a state of opposition to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, they repudiate it as strongly as we do. Nevertheless, their position is very important as being the result of relations between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the East, and as showing the terms on which reunion between East and West is possible.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Characteristics of the Schismatical Eastern Churches</h2>

<p>Although these Churches have no communion among themselves, and although many of them are bitterly opposed to the others, there are certain broad lines in which they may be classed together and contrasted with the West.</p>

<h3>National feeling</h3>

<p>The first of these is their national feeling. In all these groups the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is the nation; the vehement and often intolerant ardour of what seems to be their religious conviction is always really national <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> and national loyalty under the guise of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. This strong national feeling is the natural result of their political circumstances. For centuries, since the first ages, various nations have lived side by side and have carried on bitter opposition against each other in the Levant. <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Mesopotamia, and the Balkans have never had one homogeneous population speaking one language. From the beginning, nationality in these parts has been a question not of the soil, but of a community held together by its language, striving for supremacy with other communities. The Roman contest accentuated this. <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and then Constantinople was always a foreign tyranny to Syrians and Egyptians. And already in the fourth century of the <a href="04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> they began to accentuate their own nationalism, crushed in politics, by taking up an anti-imperial form of religion, by which they could express their <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the Government. Such an attitude has characterized these nations ever since. Under the Turk, too, the only possible separate organization was and is an <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> one. The Turk even increased the confusion. He found a simple and convenient way of organizing the subject <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> by taking their religion as a basis. So the Porte recognizes each <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> as an artificial nation (<em>millet</em>). The <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> became the "Roman nation" (<em>Rum millet</em>), inheriting the name of the old Empire. Then there were the "Armenian nation" (<em>Ermeni millet</em>), the "Coptic nation", and so on. Blood has nothing to do with it. Any subject of the Porte who joins the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> becomes a Roman and is submitted politically to the ecumenical patriarch; a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> who is converted by <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> becomes an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>. True, the latest development of <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> politics has modified this artificial system, and there have been during the nineteenth century repeated attempts to set up one great <a href="15097a.htm">Ottoman</a> nation. But the effect of centuries is too deeply rooted, and the opposition between <a href="10424a.htm">Islam</a> and <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> too great, to make this possible. A <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a> in Turkey &#151; whether Turk, <a href="01663a.htm">Arab</a>, or <a href="12627a.htm">negro</a> &#151; is simply a <a href="10424a.htm">Moslem</a>, and a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> is a Roman, or <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, or <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, etc. Our Western <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of separating politics from religion, of being on the one hand loyal citizens of our country and on the other, as a quite distinct thing, members of some Church, is unknown in the East. The <em>millet</em> is what matters; and the <em>millet</em> is a religious body. So obvious does this identification seem to them that till quite lately they applied it to us. A <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> was (and still is to the more remote and <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> people) a "French Christian", a <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> an "English Christian"; in speaking French or Italian, Levantines constantly use the word <em>nation</em> for <em>religion</em>. Hence it is, also, that there are practically no conversions from one religion to another. Theology, <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a>, or any kind of religious conviction counts for little or nothing. A man keeps to his <em>millet</em> and hotly defends it, as we do to our fatherlands; for a Jacobite to turn Orthodox would be like a <a href="06166a.htm">Frenchman</a> turning German.</p>

<p>We have noted that religious conviction counts for little. It is hard to say how much of these bodies (<a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> or <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>) are now even conscious of what was once the cardinal issue of their <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and more <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> have no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> a general and hazy <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the question &#151; <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> think that everyone else denies <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> real manhood, <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> that all their opponents "divide <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>". But what stirs their enthusiasm is not the metaphysical problem; it is the conviction that what they believe is the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of their fathers, the heroes of their "nation" who were <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the other <em>millets</em>, as they are day-to-day (for there everyone thinks that everyone else persecutes his religion). Opposed to all these little <em>milal</em> (plural of <em>millet</em>) there looms, each decade mightier and more dangerous, the West, <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> <em>Frengistan</em> (of which the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, of course, forms part to them). Their lands are overrun with <em>Frengis</em>; <em>Frengi</em> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> tempt their young men, and <em>Frengi</em> churches, with eloquent sermons and attractive services, their <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. They frequent the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> assiduously; for the Levantine has discovered that arithmetic, French, and physical <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> are useful helps to earning a good living. But to accept the <em>Frengi</em> religion means treason to their nation. It is a matter of course to them that we are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, those are our <em>milal</em>; but an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, a Copt, a <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> does not become a <em>Frengi</em>. Against this barrier argument, quotation of Scripture, texts of Fathers, accounts of <a href="07365a.htm">Church history</a>, break in vain. Your opponent listens, is perhaps even mildly interested, and then goes about his business as before. <em>Frengis</em> are very clever and learned; but of course he is an <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, or whatever it may be. Sometimes whole bodies move (as <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> have lately begun to coquet with Russian Orthodoxy), and then every member moves too. One cleaves to one's <em>millet</em> whatever it does. Certainly, if the heads of any body can be persuaded to accept reunion with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the rank and file will make no difficulty, unless there be another party strong enough to proclaim that those heads have deserted the nation.</p>

<h3>Intense conservatism</h3>

<p>The second characteristic, a corollary of the first, is the intense conservatism of all these bodies. They cling fanatically to their rites, even to the smallest custom &#151; because it is by these that the <em>millet</em> is held together. Liturgical language is the burning question in the Balkans. They are all Orthodox, but inside the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, there are various <em>milal</em> &#151; Bulgars, Vlachs, <a href="13732a.htm">Serbs</a>, Greeks, whose bond of union is the language used in church. So one understands the uproar made in <a href="12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> about language in the liturgy; the revolution among the Serbs of Uskub in 1896, when their new <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> celebrated in Greek (Orth. Eastern Church, 326); the ludicrous <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> at Monastir, in <a href="12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>, when they fought over a dead man's body and set the whole town ablaze because some wanted him to be buried in Greek and some in Rumanian (op. cit., 333). The great and disastrous <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, are simply questions of the nationality of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the language they use.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It follows then that the great difficulty in the way of reunion is this question of nationality. Theology counts for very little. Creeds and arguments, even when people seem to make much of them, are really only shibboleths, convenient expressions of what they really care about &#151; their nation. The question of nature and <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> in Christ, the <em>Filioque</em> in the Creed, azyme bread, and so on do not really stir the heart of the Eastern Christian. But he will not become a <em>Frengi</em>. Hence the importance of the Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches. Once for all these people will never become Latins, nor is there any reason why they should. The wisdom of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has always been to restore union, to insist on the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and for the rest to leave each <em>millet</em> alone with its own native <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, its own language, its own rites. When this is done we have an Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Rome and the Eastern Churches</h2>

<h3>Early attempts at reunion</h3>

<p>The attempts at reunion date from after the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="10273a.htm">Michael Caerularius</a> (1054). Before that <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was little concerned about the older <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a>. The conversion of these people might well be left to their neighbours, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Eastern Empire. Naturally, in those days the Greeks set about this conversion in the most disastrous way conceivable. It was the Government of Constantinople that tried to convert them back along the most impossible line, by destroying their nationality and centralizing them under the patriarch of the imperial city. And the means used were, frankly and crudely, <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> conventicles were broken up by imperial soldiers, <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> banished or executed. Of course this confirmed their <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of Caesar and Caesar's religion. The East, before as well as after the great <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>, did nothing towards pacifying the schismatics at its gates. Only quite lately has <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a> taken a more reasonable and conciliatory attitude towards <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> in <a href="11712a.htm">Persia</a> and <a href="01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a>, who are outside her political power. Her attitude towards people she can persecute may be seen in her abominable treatment of the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> in <a href="13231c.htm">Russia</a>.</p>

<h3>Councils of Lyons (1274) and Florence (1438)</h3>

<p>It was, in the first instance, with the Orthodox that <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> treated with a view to reunion. The <a href="09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a> (1274) and the Council of Ferrara-Florence (1438-39) were the first efforts on a large scale. And at Florence were at least some representatives of all the other Eastern Churches; as a kind of supplement to the great affair of the Orthodox, reunion with them was considered too. None of these reunions were stable. Nevertheless they were, and they remain, important facts. They (the union of Florence especially) were preceded by elaborate discussions in which the attitudes of East and West, Orthodox and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, were clearly compared. Every question was examined &#151; the primacy, the <em>Filioque</em>, azyme bread, <a href="12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> has not been forgotten in the East. It showed Eastern Christians what the conditions of reunion are, and it has left them always conscious that reunion is possible and is greatly desired by <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. And on the other hand it remains always as an invaluable precedent for the Roman Court. The attitude of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> at Florence was the only right one: to be quite unswerving in the question of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and to concede everything else that possibly can be conceded. There is no need of uniformity in rites or in canon law; as long as practices are not absolutely bad and immoral, each Church may work out its own development along its own lines. Customs that would not suit the West may suit the East very well; and we have no <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to quarrel with such customs as long as they are not forced upon us.</p>

<p>So, at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in all these matters there was no attempt at changing the old order. Each Church was to keep its own liturgy and its own canon law as far as that was not incompatible with the Roman primacy, which is <em>de fide</em>. The very <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> that proclaimed the primacy added the clause, that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> guides and rules the whole <a href="03744a.htm">Church of God</a> "without prejudice to the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of the other <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>". And the East was to keep its married <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and its leavened bread, was not to say the <em>Filioque</em> in the Creed, nor use solid <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a>, nor do any of the things they resent as being Latin.</p>

<h3>After the Council of Florence</h3>

<p>This has been the attitude of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> ever since. Many <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> have published decrees, Encyclicals, <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> that show that they have never forgotten the venerable and ancient Churches cut off from us by these <a href="13529a.htm">schisms</a>; in all these documents consistently the tone and attitude are the same. If there has been any latinizing movement among Eastern <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, it has sprung up among themselves; they have occasionally been disposed to copy practices of the far richer and mightier <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> with which they are united. But all the Roman documents point the other way.</p>

<p>If any Eastern customs have been discouraged or forbidden, it is because they were obviously abuses and immoral like the quasi-hereditary <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> of the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, or sheer <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a> like the <a href="14339a.htm">superstitions</a> forbidden by the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Synod of 1736. True, their <a href="09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> have been altered in places; <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> also that in the past these corrections were made sometimes by well-meaning officials of <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> whose <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was not equal to their <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. But in this case, too, the criterion was not conformity with the <a href="13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, but purification from supposed (sometimes mistakenly supposed) <a href="07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>. That the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite Rite</a> is so latinized is due to its own <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It was the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a> themselves who insisted on using our vestments, our azyme bread, our Communion under one kind, till these things had to be recognized, because they were already ancient customs to them prescribed by the use of generations.</p>

<p><em>Papal Documents</em></p>

<p>A short survey of papal documents relating to the Eastern Churches will make these points clear.</p>

<p>Before <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, the most important of these documents was <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV's</a> <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Allatae sunt" of 2 July, 1755. In it the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> is able to quote a long list of his predecessors who had already cared for the Eastern Churches and their rites. He mentions acts of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1198-1216), <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (1216-27), <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> (1243-54), <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> (1254-61), <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> (1271-76), <a href="11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> (1277-80), <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> (1431-47), <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (1513-21), <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> (1523-34), <a href="12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (1559-65), all to this effect.</p>

<p><a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> (1572-85) founded at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> colleges for Greeks, <a href="09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. In 1602 <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> published a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> allowing <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to celebrate their rite in Latin churches. In 1624 <a href="15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> forbade <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> to become Latins. <a href="04028a.htm">Clement IX</a>, in 1669, published the same order for <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (Allatae sunt, I). <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> not only quotes these examples of former <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, he confirms the same principle by new <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>. In 1742 he had re-established the <a href="13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Church with the Byzantine Rite after the national Council of Zamosc, confirming again the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> in 1595. When the Melkite <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a> wanted to change the use of the Presanctified Liturgy in his Rite, <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> answered: "The ancient <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> must be kept unaltered, and your <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> must be made to follow them" (Bullarium Ben. XIV., Tom. I). He ordains that Melkites who, for lack ofa <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of their own Rite, had been <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> by a Latin, should not be considered as having changed to our Use: "We forbid absolutely that any <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Melkites who follow the <a href="06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> should pass over to the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>" (ib., cap. xvii).</p>

<p>The <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Allatae sunt" forbids missionaries to convert schismatics to the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>; when they become <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> they must join the corresponding Eastern Rite (XI). In the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Etsi pastoralis" (1742) the same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> orders that there shall be no precedence because of Rite. Each <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> shall have rank according to his own position or the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>; in mixed <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, if the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Latin (as in Southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>), he is to have at least one <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the other Rite (IX).</p>

<p>Most of all did the last two <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> show their concern for Eastern Christendom. Each by a number of Acts carried on the tradition of conciliation towards the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Churches and of protection of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a>.</p>

<p><a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in his <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "In Suprema Petri" (Epiphany, 1848), again assures non-Catholics that "we will keep unchanged your <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, which indeed we greatly <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>"; <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> who join the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> are to keep the same rank and position as they had before. In 1853 the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Rumanians were given a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of their own Rite, and in the Allocution made on that occasion, as well as in the one to the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> on 2 February, 1854, he again insists on the same principle. In 1860 the Bulgars, disgusted with the Phanar (the Greeks of Constantinople), approached the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> patriarch, Hassun; he, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> confirming him, promised that there should be no latinizing of their Rite. <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> founded, 6 January, 1862, a separate department for the <a href="04312d.htm">Oriental Rites</a> as a special section of the great <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Congregation.</p>

<p><a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1888 wrote a letter to the <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a> (Paterna charitas) in which he exhorts the Gregorians to reunion, always on the same terms. But his most important act, perhaps the most important of all documents of this kind, is the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Orientalium dignitas ecclesiarum" of 30 November, 1894. In this letter the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> reviewed and confirmed all similar acts of his predecessors and then strengthened them by yet severer <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> against any form of latinizing the East. The first part of the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> quotes examples of the care of former <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> for <a href="04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a>, especially of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>; Pope Leo remembers also what he himself has already done for the same cause &#151; the foundation of colleges at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Philippopoli, <a href="01161a.htm">Adrianople</a>, <a href="02046a.htm">Athens</a>, and St. Ann at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. He again commands that in these colleges students should be exactly trained to observe their own rites. He praises these venerable Eastern <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a> as representing most ancient and sacred traditions, and quotes again the text that has been used so often for this purpose, circumdata varietate applied to the queen, who is the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (Ps. xliv, 10). The Constitutions of <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> against latinizers are confirmed; new and most severe <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> are <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a>: any missionary who tries to persuade an Eastern-Rite <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to join the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> is <em>ipso facto</em> suspended, and is to be expelled from his place. In colleges where boys of different Rites are <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> there are to be <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of each Rite to administer the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. In case of need one may receive a sacrament from a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of another Rite; but for Communion it should be, if possible, at least one who uses the same kind of bread. No length of use can prescribe a change of Rite. A <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> marrying may conform to her husband's Rite, but if she becomes a <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> she must go back to her own.</p>

<p>In the <a href="05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Praeclara gratulationis', of 20 June, 1894, that has been often described as "Leo XIII's testament", he again turned to the Eastern Churches and invited them in the most courteous and the gentlest way to come back to communion with us. He assures schismatics that no great difference exists between their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and ours, and repeats once more that he would provide for all their customs without narrowness (Orth. Eastern Church, 434, 435). It was this letter that called forth the unpardonably offense answer of Anthimos VII of Constantinople (op. cit., 435-438). Nor, as long as he lived, did <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> cease caring for Eastern Churches. On 11 June, 1895, he wrote the letter "Unitas christiana" to be the <a href="01300b.htm">Copts</a>, and on 24 December of that same year he restored the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. Lastly, on 19 March, 1895, in a <em>motu proprio</em>, he again insisted on the reverence due to the Eastern Churches and explained the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of Latin delegates in the East.</p>

<p>As a last example of all, <a href="12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in his Allocution, after the now famous celebration of the Byzantine Liturgy in his presence on 12 February, 1908, again repeated the same declaration of respect for Eastern rites and customs and the same assurance of his intention to preserve them (Echos d'Orient, May, 1908, 129-31). Indeed this spirit of conservatism with regard to <a href="09306a.htm">liturgies</a> is in our own time growing steadily at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the increase of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so that there is reason to believe that whatever unintentional mistakes have been made in the past (chiefly with regard to the <a href="09683c.htm">Maronite</a> and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a> rites) will now gradually be corrected, and that the tradition of the most entire acceptance and recognition of other rites in the East will be maintained even more firmly than in the past.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>On the other hand, in spite of occasional outbursts of anti-papal feeling on the part of the various chiefs of these Churches, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that the vision of unity is beginning to make itself seen very widely in the East. In the first place, <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and contact with Western <a href="05607b.htm">Europeans</a> inevitably breaks down a great part of the old prejudice, jealousy, and fear of us. It was a Latin missionary who said lately: "They are finding out that we are neither so vicious nor so clever as they had thought." And with this intercourse grows the hope of regeneration for their own nations by contact with the West. Once they realize that we do not want to eat them up, and that their <em>milal</em> are safe, whatever happens, they cannot but see the advantages we have to offer them. And with this feeling goes the gradual realization of something larger in the way of a Church than their own <em>milal</em>. Hitherto, it was difficult to say what the various <a href="11329a.htm">Eastern schismatics</a> understood by the "Catholic <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>" in the <a href="04478a.htm">creed</a>. The Orthodox certainly always mean their own communion only ("Orth. Eastern Church", 366-70); the other smaller bodies certainly hold that they alone have the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>; everyone else &#151; especially Latins &#151; is a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>. So, presumably, for them, too, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is only their own body. But this is passing with the growth of more <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of other countries and a juster sense of perspective. The <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> who looks at a map of the world can hardly go on <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> that his <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> is the only and whole <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And with the apprehension of larger issues there comes the first wish for reunion. For a Church consisting of mutually <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> bodies is a monstrosity that is rejected by everyone (except perhaps some <a href="01736b.htm">Armenians</a>) in the East.</p>

<p>The feeling out towards the West for sympathy, help, and perhaps eventually communion, is in the direction of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, not of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> is too remote from all their <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, and its principles are too destructive of all their system for it to attract them. Harnack notes this of <a href="13231c.htm">Russians</a>: that their more friendly feeling towards the West tends Romeward, not in an Evangelical direction (Reden and Aufs&auml;tze, II, 279); it is at least equally <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of other Eastern Churches. When the conviction has spread that they have everything to gain by becoming again members of a really universal Church, that union with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> means all the advantages of Western <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> and a sound <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> position, and that, on the other hand, it leaves the national <em>millet</em> untouched, un-latinized, and only stronger for so powerful an alliance, then indeed the now shadowy and remote issues about nature and <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> in Christ, the entirely artificial grievances of the <em>Filioque</em> and our azyme bread will easily be buried in the dust that has gathered over them for centuries, and Eastern Christians may some day wake up and find that there is nothing to do but to register again a union that ought never to have been broken.</p>
