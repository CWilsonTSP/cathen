<p>(RHEDONENSIS)</p>

<p>Rennes includes the Department of Ille et Vilaine. The Concordat of 1802 re-established the Diocese of Rennes which since then has included;</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>the ancient Diocese of Rennes with the exception of three <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> given to <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>;</li><li>the greater part of the ancient Diocese of Dol;</li><li>the greater part of the ancient Diocese of St. Malo;</li><li>ten <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> that had formed part of the ancient <a href="15271b.htm">Diocese of Vannes</a> and <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>.</li></ol></div>

<p>On 3 January, 1859, the See of Rennes, which the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> had desired to make a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, became an <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, with the Dioceses of <a href="12611a.htm">Quimper</a>, <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, and <a href="02784a.htm">St. Brieuc</a> as suffragans. Cardinal Place obtained from <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> permission for the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Rennes to add the titles of Dol and St. Malo to that of Rennes. Rennes was the capital of Brittany. Under the Roman Empire Brittany had formed part of the province of Tertia Lugdunensis (Third Lyonnesse), but from 383 to 509 it was an independent kingdom; afterwards, under the Merovingians, it ranked as a countship. The Kingdom of Brittany, founded by Nomeno&euml; about 845, was shortlived, and after 874 Brittany was parcelled out among a number of counts, the most important of whom was the Count of Rennes. In 992 Geoffrey I, Count of Rennes, took the title of Duke of Brittany. The solemn and final union of Brittany with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> was the result of the marriage of <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I</a> to Claudia of France, daughter of Anne of Brittany and Louis XII. Tradition names as first apostles of the future Diocese of Rennes, missionaries of the Latin race, but of an uncertain date: SS. Maximinus, Clarus, Justus. On the other hand, when in the fifth and sixth centuries bands of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> Britons <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from Great Britain to Armorica and formed on its northern coast the small Kingdom of Domnon&eacute;e, the Gospel was preached for the first time in the future Dioceses of Dol and Aleth. Among these missionaries were St. Armel, who, according to the legend, founded in the sixth century the town of Ploermel in the <a href="15271b.htm">Diocese of Vannes</a> and then retired into the forests of Chateaugiron and Janz&eacute; and attacked <a href="05162a.htm">Druidism</a> on the very site of the Dolmen of the Fairy Rocks (La Roche aux F&eacute;es); St. M&eacute;en (Mevennus) who retired to the solitudes around Pontreco&euml;t and founded the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Gael (550), known afterwards as St. M&eacute;en's; St. Lunarius and St. Suliacus who dwelt in the woods along the banks of the Rance, and Sts. Samson and Malo.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section1">Diocese of Rennes</h2>

<p>The earliest historical mention of the See of Rennes dates from 453. One of the four <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, Sarmatio, Chariato, Rumoridus, and Viventius who in that year took part in the Council of Angers, was <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rennes. One Athenius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rennes, took part in the Council of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a> in 461. Mgr Duchesne is of opinion that the <a href="01380b.htm">St. Amandus</a> reckoned among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Rennes at the end of the fifth century is the same as St. Amand of <a href="13107a.htm">Rodez</a>. Among other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> are the famous St. Melanius (Melaine) who in 511 assisted at the Council of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and had a widespread reputation for <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. He gave his name to a well-known <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which in the twelfth century possessed no less than seventy <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. Famous among the annals of Rennes are: St. Desiderius (Didier) whose episcopate is questioned by Mgr Duchesne (c. 682); St. Moderamnus (Moran) who died about 730 in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Berceto near Lucca; <a href="09637a.htm">Marbodus</a>, the hymnographer (1096-1123); the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Yves Mayeuc (1507-41); Arnaud d'Ossat (1596-1600), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1599, and prominent in the conversion of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>; Godefroy Brossais Saint Marc (1848-78), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1875; Charles Place (1878-93), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1886; Guillaume Labour&eacute; (1893-1906), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1897, Le Coz (1760-1815) during the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> was constitutional <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Rennes. Under the Concordat he became <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. In the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rennes had the privilege of crowning the dukes of Brittany in his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. On the occasion of his first entry into Rennes it was customary for him to be borne on the shoulders of four Breton barons.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Diocese of St. Malo</h2>

<p>The <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> Malo (died about 600) at the end of the sixth century came from <a href="15532a.htm">Wales</a> at the head of a band of emigrants and founded two <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> on the coast near the Roman post of Aleth. Two legendary biographies of him which date from the ninth century make him the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aleth. The biography of King Saint Judicael, written in the eleventh century, mentions as a contemporary of the king, a Saint Maelmon, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aleth. Local breviaries of the fifteenth century, mention three <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> prior to Maelmon: Enogat, Gurval, and Coalfinit. In Mgr Duchesne's opinion one thing only is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that the Diocese of Aleth existed in <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> time. The town of Aleth was destroyed by the Normans, and soon after 1141, the seat of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was removed to the Isle of St. Aaron (so-called after a <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> who lived there early in the sixth century), on which stood the town afterwards known as St. Malo. This change was endorsed by <a href="05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> in spite of the protests of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Marmoutiers who had a foundation on the island. Among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of St. Malo are: Blessed John de la Grille (1144-63) under whom the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred; William de Montfort (1423-32), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1426; William Bri&ccedil;onnet (1493-1513); Harlay de Saucy (1632-46).</p>

<h2 id="section3">Diocese of Dol</h2>

<p>The Life of <a href="13422c.htm">St. Samson</a>, which cannot be of earlier date than the seventh century, mentions the foundation of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Dol by <a href="13422c.htm">St. Samson</a>. He was doubtless already a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> when he came from Great Britain to Armorica, and it is he perhaps who assisted at the Council of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> between 561 and 567. But in the biography there is nothing to prove that he founded the See of Dol or that he was its first <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the twelfth century, to support its claim against the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Dol produced the names of a long list of <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>: <a href="13422c.htm">St. Samson</a>, St. Magloire, St. Budoc, St. G&eacute;nev&eacute;e, St. Restoald, St. Armel, St. Jumael, St. Turian. Mgr Duchesne discounts and <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> this list. He is of the opinion that the abbey of Dol may have had at its head from time to time <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> with episcopal <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but that Dol was not the seat of a diocese. Under <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and Louis the Pious, the Vicariate of Dol and the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. M&eacute;en were still included in the Diocese of Aleth; so that the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dol was Festianus (Festgen) mentioned for the first time between 851 and 857, and installed by King Nomeno&euml;. Among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Dol are: Baudri (1107-30), author of a poem on the conquest of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> by William the Conqueror; Alain, Cardinal de Coetivy (1456-74), as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="03187a.htm">Callistus III</a>, brought Charles VII to assist the Greeks against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> who were besieging Constantinople; Urban Ren&eacute; de Herc&eacute; (1767-95), <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> during the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, but accompanied to Brittany the royalist troops who attempted to land at Quiberon. He was arrested with his brother, and shot at <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, 3 July, 1795. There was a struggle from the ninth to the eleventh century to free the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Brittany from the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>. It is important to consider the point closely.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From a comparison made by Mgr Duchesne between the Life of St. Conwoion, the "Indiculus de episcoporum Britonum depositione", and an almost completely restored letter of <a href="09159a.htm">Leo IV</a>, it would appear that shortly before 850, Nomeno&euml; wishing to be anointed king, and finding opposition among the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of Brittany, sought to get rid of them by charging them with <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>. Their only fault was perhaps that they demanded <a href="05603b.htm">eulogia</a> from their <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> when the latter came to <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>. After listening to a deputation of Breton <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and to St. Conwoion, founder of the Abbey of St-Sauveur at Redon, who had been sent to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Nomeno&euml;, <a href="09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> declared that the charge of <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> must be adjudicated by a competent tribunal of twelve <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and must be attested by seventy-two witnesses, thereby disputing Nomeno&euml;'s claim to a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to depose <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But Nomeno&euml; did depose, and in a brutal manner, the four <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a>: Aleth, <a href="12611a.htm">Quimper</a>, and St. Pol de L&eacute;on, and made seven <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> out of their four; one of the new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> had its seat in the abbey of Dol and became straightway an archdiocese. The remaining two were in the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="02784a.htm">St. Brieuc</a> and Pabu-Tutual (Tr&eacute;guier). At the end of 850 or beginning of 851 the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the four provinces of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>, <a href="13716a.htm">Sens</a>, <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and Rouen, wrote a letter of reprimand to Nomeno&euml; and threatened him with <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. He paid no heed to them and died 7 March, 851. Salomon, Nomeno&euml;'s second successor, requested <a href="02428a.htm">Benedict IV</a> in vain to regularize the situation of the Breton <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. In the name of the Council of Savonni&egrave;res (859) the seven <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of the three kingdoms of Charles the Bald, of Lothaire II, and of Charles of Provence, wrote to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rennes and to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> occupying the new Sees of Dol, <a href="02784a.htm">St. Brieuc</a>, and Tr&eacute;guier, reproaching them with lack of obedience to the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>. This letter was not sent to the Bishops of <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, <a href="12611a.htm">Quimper</a>, Aleth, and St. Pol de L&eacute;on who wrongly occupied the <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> of the legitimate <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> illegally deposed by Nomeno&euml;. It achieved nothing. In 862 Salomon dealt directly with <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>, and at first tried to mislead the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> by means of <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> allegations and forgeries; then he restored Felix of <a href="12611a.htm">Quimper</a> and Liberalis of L&eacute;on to their sees, but still kept Susannus of <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a> and Salocon of Aleth in exile. <a href="11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> died in 867. <a href="01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> (867-72) and <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a> (872-82) continued to uphold the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>. Then came the deaths of Salomon and of Susannus, and a conciliatory mood developed. There was no formal act on the part of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> recognizing Dol as a new <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church; it never had control over Rennes or <a href="10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, and it was mainly over the new Sees of <a href="02784a.htm">St. Brieuc</a> and Tr&eacute;guier that it exercised ascendancy. Finally in May, 1199, <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> restored the old order of things, and subordinated anew all Brittany to Tours but did not interfere with the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> boundaries set up by the daring Nomeno&euml;, and they remained in force until the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dol retained until 1789 the insignia of an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, but without an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> privileges.</p>

<p>The <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of the Seven Saints of Brittany was a widespread devotion during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and probably antedates the year 1000. Four times a year, at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, Pentecost, Michaelmas, and <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, crowds of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> on foot paid within thirty days a round of visits to the seven sanctuaries, Dol, <a href="02784a.htm">St. Brieuc</a>, Tr&eacute;guier, L&eacute;on, <a href="12611a.htm">Quimper</a>, <a href="15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, St. Malo. A paved road, that kept up an earlier line uf Roman roads, was followed by these endless <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, whence arose the present custom of dedicating <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> to the Seven Saints. The ancient Abbeys of St. Melanius, St. M&eacute;en, Redon, and Paimpont, the <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of <a href="03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of Rill&eacute; (founded about 1143), of Montfort (founded about 1152) were very useful in restoring the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> services after the disorders of the early <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Two thirds of the churches in the territory date from the eleventh or twelfth century, and were built by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a>. The <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of succession of Brittany (1341-64) between Jean de Montfort and Charles de Blois has an interest for the <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a> owing to the fact that Charles de Blois has the title of Blessed. Dom Plaine has shown that the origin of the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Bonne Nouvelle at Rennes had nothing to do, as was often supposed, with a victory of Jean de Montfort over Blessed Charles de Blois. Some of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> connected with the Archdiocese of Rennes are: St. Mevennus or M&eacute;en, St. Armel, St. Sulinus (Suliac), son of Broguenard, Prince of <a href="15532a.htm">Wales</a>, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Suliac (died in 606); St. Judicael (584-658), twice King of the Bretons, twice <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded by St. M&eacute;en, and founder of the abbey of Paimpont; St. Geldouin, canon of Dol (died 1076 or 1077), who refused to become a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in spite of the appeals of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>; <a href="13096a.htm">Venerable Robert d'Arbrissel</a>, founder of the order of Fontevrault (died 1117), a native of Arbrissel near Rennes; Blessed Ralph de la Futaye, founder about 1096 of the Abbey of St. Sulpice at Rennes, known originally as Our Lady of the Blackbirds; <a href="08256b.htm">St. Yves</a> (1253-1303), who held an official position in the Diocese of Rennes; Venerable John de <a href="13422c.htm">St. Samson</a>, blind from birth, a <a href="03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> of Rennes and the great Breton contemplative, died in 1636, leaving many writings of a mystical character; Ven. Pierre Quintin (died 1629), a <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> of Vitre, and one of the collaborators of Ven. Michel de Nobletz in his apostolate. Caradeuc de la Chalotais (1701-85), born at Rennes, <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> of Brittany, was one of the first magistrates to lead the way for the abolition of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> by his <em>comptes-rendus</em> of the constitutions of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, read to the Parliament in Dec., 1761, and in May, 1762. Grimm said that the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> might consider Le Chalotais as their destroyer in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<p>Other natives of Rennes are the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Lobineau (1606-1727), famous for his "histoire de la Br&eacute;tagne" (1707), and the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> philologian Tournemine (1661-1739). Jacques Cartier (1494-1552), the discoverer of <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>; the naval commander Duguay-Trouin (1673-1736), who took Rio de Janeiro in 1711; La Bourdonnais (1699-1753), another sailor who fought against the English in <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>; the writers <a href="03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a> (1768-1848) and <a href="08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> (1782-1854) were natives of St. Malo. Duguesclin (died 1380), famous during the Hundred Years' War, was born at Ch&acirc;teau de la Motte de Bron; the Ch&acirc;teau des Rochers where Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; lived (1626-96) is near Vitre.</p>

Among congregations of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> originating in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the Daughters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, founded in 1640 by Mlle Morel du Verger for the care of incurables, with mother-house at Rennes; The Adoratrices of the Divine Justice, a teaching and nursing order with mother-house at Foug&egrave;res; the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, a teaching and nursing order founded in 1831 at St. M&eacute;en by P&egrave;re Corvoisier; the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, known as Sisters of the Oaks, or of the Junior Schools, founded in 1850 by Am&eacute;lie Fristel, a nursing and teaching order with mother-house at Param&eacute; and branches at <a href="07117b.htm">Halifax</a> and Ste Marie in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>; <a href="12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, founded in 1842 at Rennes by Jeanne Jugan, Fanchon Aubert, Marie Jamet, Virginie Tredaniel under the guidance of Abb&eacute; Lepailleur, and installed through the efforts of Abb&eacute; Ernest Leli&egrave;vre in all parts of the world. Their motherhouse at St. Pern in the Diocese of Rennes controlled in 1905, 106 houses in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, 51 in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 29 in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, 30 in America, 16 in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 13 in <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 4 in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, 3 in Oceania, 1 in <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, 1 in Turkey; 33,123 aged and infirm <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> were cared for by 4475 sisters.
