<p><a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, Prince <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, b. 1714, in the Tyrol, d. 14 April, 1803, at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. At nine years of age he entered the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for pages at the residence of Prince Bishop Lamberg at <a href="11519a.htm">Passau</a>, who later proposed him for admittance to the Collegium Germanicum in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the age of twenty-two he returned to the Tyrol and devoted himself to the study of civil and canon law. Cardinal Lamberg took him as conclavist to the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1740, whence <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> came forth <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and to him Cardinal Lamberg earnestly recommended his favourite Migazzi. The latter remained at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> "in order to quench my thirst for the best <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> at its very source". By this he meant philosophy as <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> by his words spoken about this time: "Without a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> wit is merely a light fragrance which is soon lost, and erudition a rude formless mass without life or movement, which rolls onward unable to leave any mark of its passage, consuming everything without itself deriving any benefit therefrom." In 1745 he was appointed auditor of the <a href="13205c.htm">Rota</a> for the German nation. Owing to the special friendship of <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, he was able to conclude several difficult transactions to the entire satisfaction of the <a href="09662d.htm">Empress Maria Theresa</a>, who in return appointed him in 1751 coadjutor to the aged <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. Thereupon <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he was soon removed to <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a> as ambassador. A treaty which he concluded pleased the empress so much that she appointed him coadjutor of Count Bishop Althan of <a href="15525b.htm">Waitzen</a> (1756); but as Althan died before his arrival, and six months later Prince Archbishop Trantson also died in <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, the empress named Migazzi his successor. In 1761 <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> made him administrator for life of the <a href="15525b.htm">See of Waitzen</a>, and at the same time obtained the purple for him from <a href="04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that Migazzi was now in possession of two sees, the revenues of which he applied to their improvement. In Waitzen he erected the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and episcopal palace and founded the "Collegium pauperum nobilium" and the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>. Indeed he built almost an entire new quarter in that town; it was therefore, to say the least, hard and mortifying when, after twenty-five years of administration the "Concilium locum tenens regium" asked him if there was any <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> in possession of two <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> or offices, as in that case it was the emperor's pleasure (<a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>) that one of them should be given up. Migazzi was forced to resign from <a href="15525b.htm">Waitzen</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> time brought him many sorrows. Pious and devoted to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> as <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> undoubtedly was, yet during her reign in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> the so-called Enlightenment era (<em>Aufkl&#228;rung</em>) developed inevitably. Its followers imagined that they could remedy all the evils of the time and promote in every way the prosperity of <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a>. The representatives and the literature of the new movement were everywhere in evidence. Its opponents were denounced as stupid obscurantists and simpletons. "The Masonic lodge of the Three Canons" was printed at <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1742, and at Prague in 1749 that of the "Three Crowned Stars and Honesty". In a memorial to the empress written in 1769 the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> designated as the primary causes of current evils the spirit of the times, <a href="02040a.htm">atheistic</a> literature, the pernicious influence of many professors, the condition of the censorship, contemporary literature, the contempt of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the bad example of the nobility, the conduct of affairs of state by irreligious <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, and neglect of the observance of holy days. Upon each of these disorders he spoke in noble terms of profound <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>. The situation was all the more critical for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> since while her means of resistance were diminished, her enemies were gaining adherents. Meanwhile <a href="04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> <a href="14096a.htm">suppressed the Society of Jesus</a>, but Migazzi endeavoured to save it for <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>. He wrote to the empress, "If the members of the order are dispersed, how can their places be so easily supplied? What expense will be entailed and how many years must pass before the settled condition broken up by the departure of these <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> can be restored?" Just twenty years later the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> wrote to Emperor Francis, "Even the French envoy who was last here, did not hesitate, as I can prove to your Majesty, to say that if the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had not been suppressed, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> would not have experienced that <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a> so terrible in its consequences." The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> opposed as far as they were anticlerical, the government monopoly of <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> matters, the "enlightened" <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, the "purified" law, the "enlightenment" literature, "tolerance", and encroachment on purely religious matters. He also founded the "Priesterseminar", an establishment for the better preparation of young <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> for <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> work. At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was influential enough to obtain for the Austrian monarch the privilege of being named in the Canon of the Mass. Migazzi lived to see the election of three <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. <a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> and <a href="08611b.htm">Kaunitz</a> took a lively interest in his accounts of what transpired in the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a> (23 Nov., 1775-16 Feb., 1776) which elected <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, who subsequently visited <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> during the reign of <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. He owed his election to Migazzi, leader of the Royalist party. How the empress appreciated Migazzi is sufficiently <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> in a letter she wrote to him during the <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>, "I am as ill-humoured as though I had been three months in <a href="04192a.htm">conclave</a>. I <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> for you; but I am often amused to see you <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>."</p>

<p>When <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> heard of the death of the empress he wrote, "<a href="09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> is no more. A new order of things will now begin." <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> during his ten years' reign published 6200 <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> court ordinances, and decrees affecting the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even what is judicious in them generally bears the stamp of haste. The first measures, levelled against <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, created dissatisfaction as encroachments on the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The number of memorials addressed by Cardinal Migazzi to <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> and the government was astonishingly large. He opposed all the Josephist reform decrees injurious to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The "simplified and improved studies", the new methods of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> (general <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>), interference with the constitutions of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, the suppression of <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>, and violations of her <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and interference with the matrimonial legislation of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, called for vigorous protests on the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> part; but though he protested unceasingly, it was of no avail. To be sure, matters did not culminate in a rupture with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and by his visit to <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> made some impression on the emperor, and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> pronounced no solemn condemnation of Josephism. On 12 March, 1790, Leopold, Grand Duke of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, arrived in <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, as successor of his brother Joseph, and as early as 21 March, Migazzi presented him with a memorial concerning the sad condition of the Austrian Church. He mentioned thirteen "grievances" and pointed out for each the means of redress: laxity in monastic discipline, the general <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, marriage licenses, and the "Religious Commission", which assumed the position of judge of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and their <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>. Finding his wishes only partly fulfilled, Migazzi repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Emperor Francis II, a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> whose <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> were sincere, ruled his people with fatherly care. In spite of this he confirmed the Josephist system throughout his reign. For nearly a generation the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> absorbed his attention, during which time the aforesaid "Religious Commission" paid little heed to the representations of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> insisted on its abolition. "I am in all things your Majesty's obedient subject, but in spiritual matters the shepherd must say fearlessly that it is a <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> to all <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to see such fetters laid upon the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> is even greater when such power is vested in worldly, questionable, even openly dangerous and disreputable men". Age did not diminish his interest even in matters apparently trivial, nor lessen the virile strength of his speech. "The dismal outlook of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in your Majesty's dominion is all the more grievous from the fact that one must stand by in idleness, while he realizes how easily the increasing evils could be remedied, how easily your Majesty's <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> could be calmed, the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>, respect for the Faith and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church of God</a> be secured, the rightful activities of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> set free, and religion and virtue restored to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> people. All this would follow at once, if only your Majesty, setting aside further indecision, would resolve generously and perseveringly to close once for all the sources of so great evils". The emperor in fact made henceforth greater and more numerous concessions, each of which was greeted by Migazzi with satisfaction. When the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Maria Zell, the most famous shrine in <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a>, was once more permitted, the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in person led the first procession. During his long life Migazzi strove with unceasing activity for the welfare of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; and he died full of years and of merits. He lies buried in the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Stephen.</p>
