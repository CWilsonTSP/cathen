<p>Ascetics, as a branch of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, may be briefly defined as the scientific exposition of <a href="01767c.htm">Christian asceticism</a>. Asceticism (<em>askesis, askein</em>), taken in its literal signification, means a polishing, a smoothing or refining. The Greeks used the word to designate the exercises of the athletes, whereby the powers dormant in the body were developed and the body itself was trained to its full natural beauty. The end for which these gymnastic exercises were undertaken was the laurel-wreath bestowed on the victor in the public games. Now the life of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> is, as Christ assures us, a struggle for the <a href="08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs12">Matthew 11:12</a>). To give his readers an object-lesson of this spiritual battle and moral endeavour, <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who had been trained in the Greek fashion, uses the picture of the Greek pentathlon (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs24">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>). The exercises to be assumed in this combat tend to develop and strengthen the moral stamina, while their aim is <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> leading up to man's ultimate end, union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Human nature having been weakened by <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> and ever inclining toward what is <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, this end cannot be reached except at the price of overcoming, with <a href="06689a.htm">God's grace</a>, many and serious obstacles. The moral struggle then consists first of all in attacking and removing the obstacles, that is the <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscences (<a href="04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the flesh, <a href="04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> of the eyes, and <a href="12405a.htm">pride</a> of life), which effects of <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a> serve to try and test man (Trid., Sess. V, De peccato originali). This first <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> is called by the <a href="11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> the putting off of "the old man" (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs22">Ephesians 4:22</a>). The second <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, in the words of the same Apostle, is to "put on the new man" according to the image of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs24">Ephesians 4:24</a>). The new man is Christ. It is our <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> then to strive to become like unto Christ, seeing that He is "the way, and the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs6">John 14:6</a>), but this endeavour is based on the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> and, therefore, cannot be accomplished without <a href="06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>. Its foundation is laid in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, whereby we are adopted as sons of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> through the imparting of <a href="06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Thenceforth, it must be perfected by the <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> virtues, the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and <a href="06689x.htm">actual grace</a>. Since, then, ascetics is the systematic treatise of the striving after <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>, it may be defined as the scientific guide to the acquisition of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>, which consists in expressing within ourselves, with the help of <a href="06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, the image of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by practising the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> virtues, and applying the means given for overcoming the obstacles. Let us subject the various elements of this definition to a closer examination.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2 id="section1">Nature of Christian perfection</h2>

<p>(1) To begin with, we must reject the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> conception of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who fancy that <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>, as understood by <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, is essentially negative asceticism (cf. Seberg in Herzog-Hauck, "Realencyklop&auml;die f&uuml;r prot. Theologie", III, 138), and that the correct notion of asceticism was discovered by the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. There can be no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position, if we but hearken to the clear voices of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and <a href="02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>. For these masters of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> who never tired of repeating that the ideal of asceticism upheld by them was the ideal of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> past, of the Fathers, of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, emphatically state that bodily asceticism has not an absolute, but only a relative, value. St. Thomas calls it a "means to an end", to be used with discretion. St. Bonaventure says that bodily austerities "prepare, foster, and preserve perfection" (ad perfectionem pr&aelig;parans et ipsam promovens et conservans; "Apolog. pauperum", V, c. viii). In <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of his thesis, he shows that to put an absolute value on bodily asceticism would lead to <a href="09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>. He also points to Christ, the ideal of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>, who was less austere in <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> than <a href="08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, and to the founders of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, who prescribed fewer ascetic exercises for their communities than they themselves practised (cf. J. Zahn, "Vollkommenheitsideal" in "Moralprobleme", Freiburg, 1911, p. 126 sqq.). On the other hand, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> do not deny the importance of ascetic practices for acquiring <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>. Considering the actual condition of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>, they declare these <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the removal of obstacles and for the liberation of man's moral forces, thus claiming for asceticism a positive character. A like value is put upon those exercises which restrain and guide the powers of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consequently, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> actually fulfil and always have fulfilled what Harnack sets down as a demand of the Gospel and what he pretends to have looked for in vain among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; for they do "wage battle against <a href="09580b.htm">mammon</a>, care, and selfishness, and practise that charity which loves to serve and to sacrifice itself" (Harnack, "Essence of Christianity"). The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ideal, then, is by no means confined to the negative element of asceticism, but is of a positive nature.</p>

<p>(2) The essence of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> is <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (Opusc. de perfectione christ., c. ii) calls that perfect which is conformable to its end (<em>quod attingit ad finem ejus</em>). Now, the end of man is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and what unites him, even on earth, most closely with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> (<a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs17">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#vrs16">1 John 4:16</a>). All the other virtues are subservient to <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> or are its natural prerequisites, as <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope; Love seizes man's whole <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, will), sanctifies it, and fuses new life into it. Love lives in all things and all things live in <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> and through <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. Love imparts to all things the right measure and directs them all to the last end. "Love is thus the principle of unity, no matter how diversified are the particular states, vocations, and labours. There are many provinces, but they constitute one realm. The organs are many, but the organism is one" (Zahn, l. c., p. 146). Love has, therefore, rightly been called "the bond of perfection" (<a href="../bible/col003.htm#vrs14">Colossians 3:14</a>) and the fulfilment of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> (<a href="../bible/rom013.htm#vrs8">Romans 13:8</a>). That <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> consists in <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> has ever been the teaching of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ascetical writers. A few testimonies may suffice. Writing to the Corinthians, <a href="04012c.htm">Clement of Rome</a> says (<a href="https://www.newadvent.org/bible/1co049.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 49:1</a>): "It was <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> that made all the <a href="05374a.htm">elect</a> perfect; without <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> nothing is acceptable to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" (<em>en te agape ateleiothesan pantes oi eklektoi tou theou dicha agapes ouden euareston estin to theo</em>; Funk, "Patr. apost.", p. 163). The "Epistle of Barnabas" insists that the way of light is "the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of him who created us" (<em>agapeseis ton se poiesanta</em>; Funk, l. c., p. 91), "a <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of our neighbour that does not even spare our own life" (<em>agapeseis ton plesion sou hyper ten psychen sou</em>), and it affirms that perfection is nothing else than "love and <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> over the <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> which testify to <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>" (<em>agape euphrosyns kaiagalliaseos ergon dikaiosynes martyria</em>). St. Ignatius never wearies in his letters of proposing <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> as the light and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> as the way, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> being the end and aim of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (<a href="../fathers/0104.htm"><em>Ephesians</em> 9, 14</a>; <a href="../fathers/0108.htm"><em>Philadelphians</em> 9</a>; <a href="../fathers/0109.htm"><em>Smyrn&aelig;ans</em> 6</a>). According to the "Didache", <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and of one's neighbour is the beginning of the "way of life" (c. i), and in the <a href="05008b.htm">"Epistle to Diognetus"</a> active <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> is called the fruit of <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a> in Christ. The "Pastor" of Hermas acknowledges the same ideal when he sets down "a life for <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" (<em>zoe to theo</em>) as the sum-total of human existence. To these <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> may be added <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (De fuga s&aelig;culi, c. iv, 17; c. vi, 35-36) and <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who regards perfect <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> as tantamount to perfect <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. Both St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure speak the same language, and their authority is so overpowering that the ascetical writers of all subsequent centuries have faithfully followed in their footsteps (cf. Lutz, "Die kirchl. Lehre von den evang. R&auml;ten", <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1907, pp. 26-99).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>However, though perfection is essentially <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, it is not <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that any degree of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> is sufficient to constitute <a href="11665b.htm">moral perfection</a>. The <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> perfection of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> consists in the perfection of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, which requires such a disposition "that we can act with speed and ease even though many obstacles obstruct our path" (Mutz, "Christl. Ascetik", 2nd ed., Paderborn, 1909). But this disposition of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> supposes that the passions have been subdued; for if is the result of a laborious struggle, in which the moral virtues, steeled by <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, force back and quell the <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> inclinations and habits, supplanting them by good inclinations and habits. Only then has it really become "a man's second nature, as it were, to prove his <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> at certain times and under certain circumstances, to practise virtue and, as far as <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> may, to preserve his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> even from the slightest taints" (Mutz, l. c., p. 43). Owing to the weakness of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> and the presence of the <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> (<em>fomes peccati:</em> Trid., Sess. VI, can. xxiii), a perfection that would exclude every defect cannot be attained in this life without a special privilege (cf. <a href="../bible/pro020.htm#vrs9">Proverbs 20:9</a>; <a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#vrs21">Ecclesiastes 7:21</a>; <a href="../bible/jam003.htm#vrs2">James 3:2</a>). Likewise, perfection, on this side of the grave, will never reach such a degree that further growth is impossible, as is clear from the mind of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the nature of our present existence (<em>status vioe</em>); in other words, our perfection will always be relative. As <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> says: "An unflagging <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for advancing and a continual struggle for perfection is itself perfection" (Indefessus proficiendi studium et iugis conatus ad perfectionem, perfectio reputatur; "Ep. ccliv ad Abbatem Guarinum"). Since perfection consists in <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, it is not the privilege of one particular state, but may be, and has as a fact been, attained in every state of life (cf. <a href="11665b.htm">CHRISTIAN AND RELIGIOUS PERFECTION</a>). Consequently it would be wrong to identify perfection with the so-called state of perfection and the observance of the evangelical counsels. As <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> rightly observes, there are perfect men outside the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and imperfect men within them (Summa theol., II-II, Q. clxxxiv, a. 4). True it is that the conditions for realizing the ideal of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life are, generally speaking, more favourable in the religious state than in the secular avocations. But not all are called to the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>, nor would all find in it their contentment (cf. <a href="04435a.htm">EVANGELICAL COUNSELS</a>). To sum up, the end is the same, the means are different. This sufficiently answers Harnack's objection (Essence of Christianity) that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> considers the perfect imitation of Christ possible only for the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, while she accounts the life of a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> in the world as barely sufficient for the attainment of the last end.</p>

<p>(3) The ideal, to which the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> should conform and towards which he should strive with all his powers both natural and <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, is <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. His <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> should be our <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a>. Our whole life should be so penetrated by Christ that we become <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the full sense of the word ("until Christ be formed in you"; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs19">Galatians 4:19</a>). That Christ is the supreme model and pattern of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life is <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> from Scripture, as e.g. from <a href="../bible/joh013.htm">John 13:15</a> and <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>, where imitation of Christ is directly recommended, and from <a href="../bible/joh008.htm">John 8:12</a>, where Christ is called "the light of the world". Cf. also <a href="../bible/rom008.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, <a href="../bible/gal002.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, <a href="../bible/phi003.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>, and <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs3">Hebrews 1:3</a>, where the Apostle extols the excellent <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, for whom he has suffered the loss of all things, counting them but as dung, that he may gain Christ. Of the numerous testimonies of the Fathers we only quote that of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who says: "Finis ergo noster perfectio nostra esse debet; perfectio nostra Christus" (P.L., XXXVI, 628; cf. also "In Psalm.", 26, 2, in P.L., XXXVI, 662). In Christ there is no shadow, nothing one-sided. His Divinity guarantees the purity of the model; His humanity, by which He became similar to us, makes the model attractive. But this picture of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, unmarred by addition or omission, is to be found only in the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and, owing to her indefectibility, will always continue there in its ideal state. For the same reason, the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> alone can give us the guarantee that the ideal of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life will always remain pure and unadulterated, and will not be identified with one particular state or with a subordinate virtue (cf. Zahn, l. c., p. 124). An unprejudiced. examination proves that the ideal of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life has been preserved in all its purity through the centuries and that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has never failed to correct the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> touches with which <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> might have sought to disfigure its unstained beauty. The individual features and the fresh colours for outlining the living picture of Christ are derived from the sources of Revelation and the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. These tell us about the internal <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of Christ (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs14">John 1:14</a>; <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs9">Colossians 2:9</a>; <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs9">Hebrews 1:9</a>; etc.). His life overflowing with grace, of whose fulness we have all received (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs16">John 1:16</a>), His life of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (<a href="../bible/mar001.htm#vrs21">Mark 1:21, 35</a>; <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs1">3:1</a>; <a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs16">Luke 5:16</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs12">6:12</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs18">9:18</a>; etc.), His devotion to His heavenly Father (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs26">Matthew 11:26</a>; <a href="../bible/joh004.htm#vrs34">John 4:34</a>; <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs30">5:30</a>; <a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs26">8:26, 29</a>), His intercourse with men (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs10">Matthew 9:10</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs22">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>), His spirit of unselfishness and sacrifice, His patience and meekness, and, finally, His asceticism as revealed in his fastings (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs2">Matthew 4:2</a>; <a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs18">6:18</a>).</p>

<h2 id="section2">Dangers of the ascetical life</h2>

<p>The second task of ascetical theology is to point out the dangers which may frustrate the attainment of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> and to indicate the means by which they can be avoided successfully. The first danger to be noticed is <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. A second danger lies in the allurements of the visible creation, which occupy man's heart to the exclusion of the <a href="06640a.htm">highest good</a>; to the same class belong the enticements of the <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a>, corrupt world (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#vrs19">1 John 5:19</a>), that is, those men who <a href="12454b.htm">promulgate</a> vicious and ungodly doctrines and thereby dim or deny man's sublime destiny, or who by perverting <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> concepts and by setting a bad example give a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> tendency to man's sensuality. Thirdly, ascetics acquaints us not only with the malice of the <a href="04764a.htm">devil</a>, lest we should fall a prey to his cunning wiles, but also with his weakness, lest we should lose heart. Finally, not satisfied with indicating the general means to be used for waging a victorious combat, ascetics offers us particular remedies for special <a href="14504a.htm">temptations</a> (cf. Mutz, "Ascetik", 2nd ed., p. 107 sqq.).</p>

<h2 id="section3">Means for realizing the Christian ideal</h2>

<p>(1) <a href="12345b.htm">Prayer</a>, above all, in its stricter meaning, is a means of attaining perfection; special devotions approved by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and the sacramental means of sanctification have a special reference to the striving after perfection (frequent confession and communion). Ascetics proves the necessity of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs5">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>) and teaches the mode of <a href="12345b.htm">praying</a> with spiritual profit; it justifies vocal <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> and teaches the art of meditating according to the various methods of St. Peter of Alcantara, of St. Ignatius, and other <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, especially the "tres modi orandi" of St. Ignatius. An important place is assigned to the <a href="05675a.htm">examination of conscience</a>, and justly so, because ascetical life wanes or waxes with its neglect or careful performance. Without this regular practice, a thorough purification of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and progress in spiritual life are out of the question. It centres the searchlight of the interior vision on every single action: all <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, whether committed with full consciousness or only half <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a>, even the negligences which, though not <a href="14004b.htm">sinful</a>, lessen the perfection of the act, all are carefully scrutinized (<em>peccata, offensiones, negligentioe;</em> cf. "Exercitia spiritualia" of St. Ignatius, ed. <a href="13182a.htm">P. Roothaan</a>, p. 3). Ascetics distinguishes a twofold <a href="05675a.htm">examination of conscience</a>: one general (examen generale), the other special (examen particulare), giving at the same time directions how both kinds may be made profitable by means of certain practical and <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> aids. In the general examination we recall all the faults of one day; in the particular, on the contrary, we focus our attention on one single defect and mark its frequency, or on one virtue to augment the number of its acts.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Ascetics encourages visits to the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> (<em>visitatio sanctissimi</em>), a practice meant especially to nourish and strengthen the divine virtues of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity. It also inculcates the veneration of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, whose virtuous lives should spur us on to imitation. It is plain that imitation cannot mean an exact copying. What ascetics proposes as the most natural method of imitation is the removal or at least the lessening of the contrast existing between our own lives and the lives of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, the perfecting, as far as is possible, of our virtues, with due regard to our personal disposition and the surrounding circumstances of time and place. On the other hand, the observation that some <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> are more to be admired than imitated must not lead us into the mistake of letting our works be weighted with the ballast of human comfort and ease, so that we at last look with suspicion on every heroic act, as though it were something that transcended our own energy and could not be reconciled with the present circumstances. Such a suspicion would be justified only if the heroic act could not at all be made to harmonize with the preceding development of our interior life. <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> ascetics must not overlook the <a href="15464b.htm">Blessed Mother of God</a>; for she is, after Christ, our most sublime ideal. No one has received grace in such fulness, no one has co-operated with grace so faithfully as she. It is for this reason that the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> praises her as the Mirror of Justice (<em>speculum justitioe</em>). The mere thought of her transcendent purity suffices to repel the alluring charms of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and to inspire pleasure in the wonderful lustre of <a href="15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>(2) Self-Denial is the second means which ascetics teaches us (cf. <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs24">Matthew 16:24-25</a>). Without it the combat between spirit and flesh, which are contrary to each other (<a href="../bible/rom007.htm#vrs23">Romans 7:23</a>; <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs27">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs17">Galatians 5:17</a>), will not lead to the victory of the spirit (Imitatio Christi, I, xxv). How far self-denial should extend is clear from the actual condition of <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a> after the fall of Adam. The inclination to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> dominates both the will and the lower <a href="01656a.htm">appetites</a>; not only the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, but also the outer and the inner senses are made subservient to this <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> propensity. Hence, self-denial and self-control must extend to all these faculties. Ascetics reduces self-denial to exterior and interior <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a>: exterior <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> is the <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> of sensuality and the senses; interior <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> consists in the purification of the faculties of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> (memory, <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>, <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a>, will) and the mastering of the passions. However, the term "mortification" must not be taken to mean the stunting of the "strong, full, healthy" (Schell) life; what it aims at is that the sensual passions do not gain the upper hand over the will. It is precisely through taming the passions by means of <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> and self-denial that life and energy are strengthened and freed from cumbersome shackles. But while the masters of asceticism recognize the necessity of <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> and self-denial and are far from deeming it "criminal to assume <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> sufferings" (Seeberg), they are just as far from advocating the so-called "non-sensual" tendency, which, looking upon the body and its life as a <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, proposes to avert its noxious effects by wilful weakening or even mutilation (cf. Schneider, "G&ouml;ttliche Weltordnung u. religionslose Sittlichkeit", <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1900, p. 537). On the other hand, <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> will never befriend the gospel of "healthy sensuality", which is only a pretty-sounding title, invented to cloak unrestricted <a href="04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>.</p>

<p>Special attention is devoted to the mastering of the passions, because it is with them above all else that the moral combat must be waged most relentlessly. <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> enumerates the following passions: <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a>, desire, horror, <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a>, sadness, hope, despair, boldness, fear, <a href="01489a.htm">anger</a>. Starting from the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that the passions (<em>passiones</em>, as understood by <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>) are inherent in <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a>, ascetics affirms that they are neither sicknesses, as the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, and <a href="08603a.htm">Kant</a> maintain, nor yet harmless, as was asserted by the Humanists and Rousseau, who denied <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>. On the contrary, it insists that in themselves they are indifferent, that they may be employed for good and for <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that they receive a moral character only by the use to which the will puts them. It is the purpose of ascetics to point out the ways and means by which these passions can be tamed and mastered, so that, instead of goading the will to <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>, they are rather turned into welcome allies for the accomplishment of good. And since the passions are inordinate in as far as they turn to illicit things or exceed the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> bounds in those things which are licit, ascetics teaches us how to render them innocuous by averting or restraining them, or by turning them to loftier purposes.</p>

<p>(3) Labour, also, is subservient to the striving after perfection. Untiring labour runs counter to our corrupt nature, which loves ease and comfort. Hence labour, if well-ordered, persistent, and purposeful, implies self-denial. This is the reason why the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has always looked upon labour, both manual and <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a>, as an ascetic means of no small value (cf. Cassian, "De instit. coenob.", X, 24; St. Benedict, Rule, xlviii, li; Basil, "Reg. fusius tract." c. xxxvii, 1-3; "Reg. brevius tract.", c. lxxii; <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04161.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> I.28</a>). <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> is even of the opinion that <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and avoidance of labour are irreconcilable in the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal of life (cf. Mausbach, "Die Ethik des hl. Augustinus", 1909, p. 264).</p>

<p>(4) Suffering, too, is an integral constituent of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal and pertains consequently to ascetics. But its real value appears only when seen in the light of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, which teaches us that suffering makes us like unto Christ, we being the members of the mystic body of which He is the head (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs21">1 Peter 2:21</a>), that suffering is the channel of grace which heals (<em>sanat</em>), preserves (<em>conservat</em>), and tests (<em>probat</em>). Finally, ascetics teaches us how to turn sufferings into channels of heavenly grace.</p>

<p>(5) The Virtues are subjected to a thorough discussion. As is <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> in <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, our <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> receives in justification <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> habits, not only the three Divine, but also the moral virtues (Trid., Sess. VI, De justit., c. vi; Cat. Rom., p. 2, c. 2, n. 51). These <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> powers (<em>virtutes infusoe</em>) are joined to the natural faculties or the acquired virtues (<em>virtutes acguisitoe</em>), constituting with them one principle of action. It is the task of ascetics to show how the virtues, taking into account the obstacles and means mentioned, can be reduced to practice in the actual life of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, so that <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> be perfected and the image of Christ receive perfect shape in us. Conformable to the <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, "Testem benevolenti&aelig;" of 22 Jan., 1899, ascetics insists that the so-called "passive" virtues (meekness, <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>, obedience, patience) must never be set aside in favour of the "active" virtues (devotion to <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, scientific activity, social and civilizing labour); for this would be tantamount to denying that Christ is the perpetual model. Rather, both kinds must be harmoniously joined in the life of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. True imitation of Christ is never a brake, nor does it blunt the initiative in any field of human endeavour. On the contrary, the practice of the passive virtues is a support and aid to <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> activity. Besides, it not rarely happens that the passive virtues reveal a higher degree of moral energy than the active. The <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> itself refers us to <a href="../bible/mat021.htm#vrs29">Matthew 21:29</a>; <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs29">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs24">Galatians 5:24</a>; <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs8">Philippians 2:8</a>; <a href="../bible/heb013.htm#vrs8">Hebrews 13:8</a> (cf. also Zahn, l. c., 166 sqq.).</p>

<h2 id="section4">Application of the means in the three degrees of Christian perfection</h2>

<p>lmitation of Christ is the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of all who strive after perfection. It lies in the very nature of this formation after the image of Christ that the process is gradual and must follow the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of moral energy; for <a href="11665b.htm">moral perfection</a> is the terminus of a laborious journey, the crown of a hard-fought battle. Ascetics divides those who strive after perfection into three groups: the beginners, the advanced, the perfect; and correspondingly sets down <a href="14254a.htm">three stages or ways</a> of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>: the purgative way, the illuminative way, the unitive way. The means stated above are applied with more or less diversity according to the stage which the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> has reached. In the purgative way, when the <a href="01656a.htm">appetites</a> and inordinate passions still possess considerable strength, <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> and self-denial are to be practised more extensively. For the seeds of the spiritual life will not sprout unless the tares and thistles have first been weeded out. In the illuminative way, when the mists of passion have been lifted to a great extent, meditation and the practice of virtues in imitation of Christ are to be insisted on. During the last stage, the unitive way, the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> must be confirmed and perfected in conformity with <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> will ("And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me": <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs20">Galatians 2:20</a>). Care must, however, be taken not to mistake these three stages for wholly separate portions of the striving after virtue and perfection. Even in the second and the third stages there occur at times violent struggles, while the <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> of being united with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> may sometimes be granted in the initial stage as an inducement for further advance (cf. Mutz, "Aszetik," 2nd ed., 94 sq.).</p>

<h2 id="section5">Relation of ascetics to moral theology and mysticism</h2>

<p>All these disciplines are concerned with the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life and its last end in the next world; but they differ, though not totally, in their mode of treatment. Ascetical <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, which has been separated from <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, has for its subject-matter the striving after <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>; it shows how <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> may be attained by earnestly exercising and schooling the will, using the specified means both to avoid the dangers and allurements of <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and to practise virtue with greater intensity. Moral <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, on the other hand, is the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>, and in discussing the virtues is satisfied with a scientific exposition. Mysticism treats essentially of "union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>" and of the extraordinary, so-called mystic <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Though also those phenomena which are accidental to <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, such as <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, <a href="15477a.htm">vision</a>, revelation, fall within its scope, yet they are by no means essential to the mystic life (cf. Zahn, "Einf&uuml;hrung in die christl. Mystik", Paderborn, 1908). It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> includes also matter of ascetics, such as the endeavour of purification, vocal <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, etc.; but this is done because these exercises are looked upon as preparatory to the mystical life and must not be discarded even in its highest stage. Nevertheless, the mystical life is not merely a higher degree of the ascetical life, but differs from it essentially, the mystical life being a special grace granted to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> without any immediate merit on his part.</p>

<h2 id="section6">Historical development of asceticism</h2>

<p><em>(1) The Holy Bible</em></p>

<p>Abounds in practical instructions for the life of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a>. Christ himself has drawn its outlines both as to its negative and positive requirements. His imitation is the supreme law (<a href="../bible/joh008.htm#vrs12">John 8:12</a>; <a href="../bible/joh012.htm#vrs26">12:26</a>), charity the first commandment (<a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs36">Matthew 22:36-38</a>; <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs17">John 15:17</a>); the right intention is that which imparts value to the exterior works (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm">Matthew 5</a>-<a href="../bible/mat007.htm">7</a>), while self-denial and the carrying of the cross are the conditions for His <a href="05029a.htm">discipleship</a> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs38">Matthew 10:38</a>; <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs24">16:24</a>; <a href="../bible/mar008.htm#vrs34">Mark 8:34</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs23">Luke 9:23</a>; <a href="../bible/luk014.htm#vrs27">14:27</a>). Both by His own example (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs2">Matthew 4:2</a>) and His exhortations (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm#vrs20">Matthew 17:20</a>; <a href="../bible/mar009.htm#vrs28">Mark 9:28</a>) Christ recommended <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>. He inculcated sobriety, watchfulness, and <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs42">Matthew 24:42</a>; <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs13">25:13</a>; <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs41">26:41</a>; <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs37">Mark 13:37</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs37">14:37</a>). He pointed to poverty as a means of gaining the <a href="08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/mat006.htm#vrs19">Matthew 6:19</a>; <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs22">13:22</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs20">Luke 6:20</a>; <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs14">8:14</a>; <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#vrs33">12:33</a>; etc.) and counselled the rich youth to relinquish everything and to follow Him (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs21">Matthew 19:21</a>). That this was a counsel and not a strict command, given in view of the particular attachment of the youth to the things of this world, is shown by the very fact that the Master had twice said "keep the commandments", and that he recommended the renunciation of all earthly goods only on the renewed inquiry after the means that lead to perfection (cf. Lutz, l. c., against the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> Th. Zahn, Bern, Weiss, Lemme, and others). <a href="03481a.htm">Celibacy</a> for <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> sake was praised by Christ as worthy of a special heavenly reward (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs12">Matthew 19:12</a>). Yet marriage is not condemned, but the words, "All men take not this word, but they to whom it is given", imply that it is the ordinary state, <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a> for <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> sake being merely a counsel. Indirectly, Christ also commended <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> obedience as a means for attaining the most intimate union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs4">Matthew 18:4</a>; <a href="../bible/mat020.htm#vrs22">20:22, 25</a>). What Christ had outlined in his teachings the Apostles continued to develop. It is especially in <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> that we find the two elements of <a href="01767c.htm">Christian asceticism</a> brought out in well-defined terms: <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> of inordinate desires as the negative element (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs8">Romans 6:8, 13</a>; <a href="../bible/2co004.htm#vrs16">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs24">Galatians 5:24</a>; <a href="../bible/col003.htm#vrs5">Colossians 3:5</a>), union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> in all our thoughts, words, and deeds (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs31">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>; <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#vrs14">Galatians 6:14</a>; <a href="../bible/col003.htm#vrs3">Colossians 3:3-17</a>), and active <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbour (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs35">Romans 8:35</a>; <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>) as the positive element.</p>

<p><em>(2) Fathers and Doctors of the Church</em></p>

<p>With the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> as a basis, the Fathers and <a href="05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a> explained particular features of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life in a more coherent and detailed manner. The <a href="01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> called the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and man the sun of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, which, animating all virtues with its vital rays, inspires contempt of the world, beneficence, immaculate purity, and self-sacrifice. The <a href="04779a.htm">"Didache"</a>, which was intended to serve as a manual for <a href="03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, thus describes the way of life: "First, thou shalt <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, who created thee; secondly, thou shalt <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> thy neighbour as thyself; whatever thou wishest that it should not be done to thee, do not to others." Following probably the "Didache", the so-called "Epistle of Barnabas", written at the end of the second century, represents the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life under the figure of the two ways, that of light and that of darkness. Two Epistles, which purport to come from the pen of St. Clement, but were probably written in the third century, exalt the life of virginity, if grounded on the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and accompanied by the corresponding works, as heavenly, divine, and <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a>. We also mention <a href="07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a>, of whose letters <a href="12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> says that they contain "faith and patience and all edification in the Lord", and the "Pastor" of Hermas, who in the twelve commandments inculcates simplicity, truthfulness, chastity, meekness, patience, continence, confidence in <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and perpetual struggle against <a href="04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>. With the third century the works on <a href="01767c.htm">Christian asceticism</a> began to show a more scientific character. In the writings of <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> and <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> ("Moral.", XXXIII, c. xxvii; cf. also Cassian, "Coll,", IX, XV) there may be observed traces of the threefold degree which was afterwards systematically developed by <a href="05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>. In his <a href="../fathers/0210.htm">"Stromata"</a> Clement sets forth the full beauty and grandeur of "true philosophy". It is particularly remarkable that this author delineates, even in its details, what is now known as <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> culture, and that he endeavours to harmonize it with the example given by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The life of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> is to be ruled in all things by temperance. Following out this <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a>, he discusses in a casuistic form food and drink, dress and <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of finery, bodily exercises and social conduct. Beginning with the fourth century, a twofold line of thought is discernible in the works on <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life: one speculative, laying stress on the union of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="01060c.htm">Absolute</a> Truth and Goodness; the other practical, aiming principally at instruction in the practice of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> virtues. The speculative element prevailed in the mystical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, which owes its systematic development to <a href="05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> and which reached its highest perfection in the fourteenth century. The practical element was emphasized in the ascetical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> with <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> as its chief representative, in whose footsteps followed <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> and St. Bernard.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It may suffice to detail the principal points on which the writers prior to the <a href="13548a.htm">medieval-scholastic</a> period dwelt in their instructions. On <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> we have the works of Macarius the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> (d. 385) and of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (d. after 220), who supplemented his treatise on <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> in general by an explanation of the <a href="09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>. To these two must be added <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian of Carthage</a> (d. 258), who wrote "De oratione dominica", and <a href="08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (d. 407). Penance and the spirit of penance were treated by <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0320.htm"><em>De poenitentia</em></a>), <a href="08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> ("De compunctione cordis", "De poenitentia"), and <a href="04595b.htm">Cyril of Jerusalem</a> (d. 386) in his second <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction. That the life of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> is a <a href="15546c.htm">warfare</a> is amply illustrated in <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> (d. 430) "De agone christiano" and in his "Confessions". Chastity and virginity were treated by <a href="10243a.htm">Methodius of Olympus</a> (d. 311) in his "Convivium", a work in which ten virgins, discussing virginity, demonstrate the moral superiority of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> over the <a href="05556a.htm">ethical</a> tenets of <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> philosophy. The same subject is discussed by the following Fathers: <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> (d. 258); <a href="07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> (d. 394) in his "De virginitate"; Ambrose (d. 397), the indefatigable eulogist and champion of the virginal life; <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a> in his "Adversus Helvidium de virginitate" and "Ad Eustachium"; <a href="08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> (d. 407) in his "De virginitate", who, though extolling virginity as a heavenly life, yet recommends it only as a counsel; <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a> in his works "De continentia", "De virginitate", "De bono viduitatis".</p>

<p>On patience we have the works of <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, and <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> "De patientia", in which he speaks of this virtue as an invalid might speak of health to console himself. <a href="08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> "De jejunio et eleemosyna" discusses <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>. Almsgiving  and <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> are encouraged in <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian's</a> "De opere et eleemosynis" and in Augustine's "De fide et operibus". The value of labour is explained in "De opere monachorum" by <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. Nor are treatises on the different states of life wanting. Thus St. Augustine's "De bono conjugali" treats of the married state; his "De bono viduitatis" of <a href="15617c.htm">widowhood</a>. A frequent subject was the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. <a href="07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, in his "De fuga", treats of the dignity and responsibility of the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; <a href="08452b.htm">Chrysostom's</a> "De sacerdotio" exalts the sublimity of this state with surpassing excellence; St. Ambrose in his "De officiis", while speaking of the four cardinal virtues, admonishes the <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> that their lives should be an illustrious example; <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> "Epistola ad Nepotianum" discusses the dangers to which <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> are exposed; finally, the "Regula pastoralis" of <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> inculcates the <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> indispensable to the <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> in his dealings with different classes of men. Of prime importance for the monastic life was the work "De institutis coenobiorum" of Cassian. But the standard work from the eighth to the thirteenth century was the <a href="02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, which found numerous commentators. Of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> or rather his Rule St. Bernard says: "lpse dux noster, ipse magister et legifer noster est" (Serm. in Nat. S. Bened., n. 2). Illustrations of the practice of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> virtues in general were the "Expositio in beatum Job" of <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> and the "Collationes Patrum" of Cassian, in which the various elements of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> were discussed in the form of dialogues.</p>

<p><em>(3) The Medieval-Scholastic Period</em></p>

<p>The transition period up to the twelfth century exhibits no specially noteworthy advance in ascetical literature. To the endeavour to gather and preserve the teachings of the Fathers we owe <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> "De virtutibus et vitiis". But when in the twelfth century speculative <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> was celebrating its triumphs, mystical and ascetical <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, too, showed a healthy activity. The results of the former could not but benefit the latter by placing <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> morality on a scientific basis and throwing ascetical <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> itself into a scientific form. The pioneers in this field were St. Bernard (d. 1156) and Hugh and <a href="13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a>. St. Bernard, the greatest mystical <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the twelfth century, also holds a prominent place among ascetical writers, so that Harnack calls the "religious genius" of the twelfth century. The basic <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of his works, especially prominent in his treatise "De gratia et libero arbitrio", is that the life of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> should be a copy of the life of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Like <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, he, too, lays down <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> for the regulation of the necessities of life, as food and dress, and for the implanting of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> in <a href="09580c.htm">man's</a> heart, which would sanctify all things ("Apologia", "De pr&aelig;cepto et dispensatione"). Many are the steps by which <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> ascends till it reaches its perfection in the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> sake. Among his <a href="14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writings are: "Liber de diligendo Deo", "Tractatus de gradibus humilitatis et superbi&aelig;", "De moribus et officio episcoporum", "Sermo de conversione ad clericos", "Liber de consideratione".</p>

<p>Frequent allusions to <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> are scattered through the pages of <a href="07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> (d. 1141), so much so that he earned the distinction of being called a second <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a> by his contemporaries. He was undoubtedly the first to give to ascetical <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> a more or less definite, scientific character. The ever-recurring theme of his works is <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>. But what he aimed at above all in his writings was to lay bare the <a href="12545b.htm">psychological</a> bearings of mystical and ascetical <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>. Noteworthy are his works: "De vanitate mundi", "De laude caritatis", "De mode orandi", "De meditatione". His pupil, <a href="13045c.htm">Richard of St. Victor</a> (d. 1173), though more ingenious and systematic, is yet less intent upon practical utility, except in his work "De exterminatione mali et promotione boni". The great <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the thirteenth century, who were no less famous for their scholastic "Summ&aelig;" than for their ascetical and mystical writings, brought ascetical teaching to its perfection and gave it the definite shape it has retained as a standard for all future times. No other epoch furnishes such convincing <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> are rather a help than a hindrance to each other. <a href="01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a>, the illustrious teacher of the great Thomas, who was the first to join <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> with <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> and to make philosophy the handmaid of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was at the same time the author of excellent works on ascetics and <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, as, e.g., "De adh&aelig;rendo Deo", the ripest fruit of his mystic genius, and "Paradisus anim&aelig;", which was conceived along more practical lines. To <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> we owe the ascetic work "De perfectione vit&aelig; spiritualis"; in it he explains the essence of <a href="11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> so lucidly that his line of argumentation may even in our days serve as a model. His other works, too, contain ample material of value both for ascetics and for <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>.</p>

<p>The Seraphic Doctor, St. Bonaventure, "treats of mystic theology", to use the words of <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, "in a manner so perfect that the unanimous opinion of the most expert <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> regards him as the prince of mystic <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>". Of his authentic works the following deserve to be mentioned: "De perfectione evangelica", "Collationes de septem donis Spiritus sancti", "Incendium amoris", "Soliloquium", "Lignum vit&aelig;", "De pr&aelig;paratione ad Missam", "Apologia pauperum". From the pen of <a href="04644a.htm">David of Augsburg</a>, a contemporary of these great masters, we have an ascetic instruction for <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a> in his book entitled "De exterioris et interioris hominis compositione". He leads the reader along the <a href="14254a.htm">three well-known ways</a>, purgative, illuminative, and unitive, purposing to make the reader a spiritual man. By severely disciplining the faculties of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> and subordinating the flesh to the spirit, man must restore the original order, so that he may not only do what is good, but likewise do it with ease. There remains to be mentioned the "Summa de vitiis et virtutibus" of <a href="15642a.htm">Peraldus</a> (d. c. 1270). The fourteenth century is characterized throughout by its mystical tendencies. Among the works which this period produced, <a href="07238c.htm">Henry Suso's</a> "Booklet of Eternal Wisdom deserves special mention on account of its highly practical value. Pre-eminent in the fifteenth century were <a href="06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, <a href="04734a.htm">Dionysius the Carthusian</a>, and the author of the <a href="07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a>. Relinquishing the ideals of the mystic writers of the fourteenth century, <a href="06530c.htm">Gerson</a> attached himself again to the great scholastic writers, thus avoiding the vagaries which had become alarmingly frequent among the mystics. His "Considerationes de theologia mystica" shows that he belongs to the practical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of asceticism. <a href="04734a.htm">Dionysius the Carthusian</a> is esteemed as a highly gifted teacher of the spiritual life. Both <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> properly so called and practical asceticism owe valuable works to his pen. To the latter category belong: "De remediis tentationum", "De via purgativa", "De oratione", "De gaudio spirituali et pace interna", "De quatuor novissimis".</p>

<p>The "Imitatio Christi", which appeared in the middle of the fifteenth century, deserves special attention on account of its lasting influence. "It is a classic in its ascetical unction and perfect in its artistic style" (Hamm, "Die Sch&ouml;nheit der kath. Moral", Munich-Gladbach, 1911, p. 74). In four books it treats of the interior spiritual life in imitation of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. It pictures the struggle which man must wage against his inordinate passions and perverse inclinations, the indulgence of which sullies his <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> and robs him of <a href="06689a.htm">God's grace</a>: "Vanity of vanities and all is vanity, except to <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and serve Him alone" (Vanitas vanitatum et omnia vanitas pr&aelig;ter amare Deum et illi soli servire: I, i). It advises <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> and self-denial as the most efficacious weapons in this struggle. It teaches man to establish <a href="08646a.htm">God's kingdom</a> in his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> by the practice of virtues according to the example of <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. It finally leads him to union with Christ by exciting <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for him as well as by pointing out the frailty of all creatures: "It is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to leave the beloved thing for the beloved, because <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus</a> wishes to be <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> above all things" (Oportet dilectum propter dilectum relinquere, quia Jesus vult solus super omnia amari: II, xvii). The thoughts of the "Imitation" are thrown into epigrams so simple that they are within the <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> grasp of all. Though the book betrays that the author was well versed not only in <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, but also in the secrets of the mystical life, yet this fact never obtrudes itself on the reader, nor does it obscure the meaning of the contents. There are a number of quotations from the great <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> <a href="02084a.htm">Augustine</a>, Bernard, Bonaventure, and Thomas, from <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Ovid, and Seneca; yet these do not mar the impression that the whole work is the spontaneous outburst of an intensely glowing <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. It has often been said that the teachings of the "Imitation" are "unworldly" and show little appreciation for <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. But, to judge the work aright, one must take into consideration the peculiar circumstances of the time. <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> had entered on a period of decline and had lost itself in intricate subtleties; <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> had gone astray; all classes had been more or less infected with the spirit of licentiousness. It is conditions like these that give us the key to interpret phrases such as the following: "I would rather feel compunction than <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> how to define it" (Opto magis sentire compunctionem quam scire ejus definitionem) or "This is the highest wisdom: through contempt of the world to strive for the <a href="08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>" (Ista est summa sapientia: per contemptum mundi tendere ad regna coelestia).</p>

<p><em>(4) Modern Times</em></p>

<p>During the sixteenth century <a href="14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a> and <a href="07639c.htm">St. Ignatius of Loyola</a> stand out most prominently owing to the wide-felt influence which they exerted upon the religion of their contemporaries, an influence that is still at work through their writings. The writings of St. Teresa arouse our admiration by the simplicity, clearness, and precision of her judgment. Her letters show her to be an enemy of everything that smacks of eccentricity or singularity, sham <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> or indiscreet <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>. One of her principal works, the "Way to Perfection", though written primarily for <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, also contains apposite instructions for those who live in the world. While teaching the way to contemplation, she yet insists that not all are called to it and that there is greater security in the practice of <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>, <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and the other virtues. Her masterpiece is the "Castle of the Soul", in which she expounds her theory of <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> under the metaphor of a "castle" with many chambers. The <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> resplendent with the beauty of the diamond or crystal is the castle; the various chambers are the various degrees through which the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> must pass before she can dwell in perfect union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Scattered throughout the work are many hints of inestimable value for asceticism as applied in everyday life. This fact is undoubtedly due to the well-founded conviction of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> that even in extraordinary states the ordinary means must not be set aside altogether, so that illusions may be guarded against (cf. J. Zahn, "Introduction to Mysticism" p. 213).</p>

<p>In his "Exercitia spiritualia" St. Ignatius has left to posterity not only a grand literary monument of the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also a method unparalleled in its practical efficacy of strengthening the willpower. The booklet has appeared in numberless editions and revisions and, "despite its modest guise, is in reality a complete system of asceticism" (Meschler). The four weeks of the Exercises acquaint the exercitant with the three degrees of the spiritual life. The first week is taken up with cleansing the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> and from its inordinate attachment to creatures. The second and third weeks lead the exercitant along the illuminative way. The portrait of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the most lovable of all men, is outlined before his eyes, so that he can contemplate in the humanity the reflex of Divine light and the supreme model of all virtues. The meditations of the fourth week, the subject of which are the <a href="12789a.htm">resurrection</a> etc., lead to union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and teach the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> to rejoice in the glory of the Lord. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, there are many rules and regulations, the sequence is most <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a>, the arrangement of the meditations follows the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="12545b.htm">psychology</a>; yet these exercises do no <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> to the <a href="06259a.htm">free will</a>, but are meant to strengthen the faculties of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. They do not, as has often been asserted, make the exercitant a powerless instrument in the hands of the confessor, nor are they a mystic flight to <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a>, accomplished by means of a compulsion which intends a rapid advance in perfection by a mechanical process (Z&ouml;ckler, "Die Tugendlehre des Christentums", G&uuml;tersloh, 1904, p. 335). Their marked intellectualism, so frequently objected to, in no way constitutes a hindrance to <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> (Meschler, "Jesuitenaszese u. deutsche Mystik" in "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach", 1912). On the contrary, they make man's moral will truly free by removing the hindrances, while, by cleansing the heart and by accustoming the mind to meditative <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, they are an excellent preparation for the mystical life. <a href="09385b.htm">Louis of Granada, O. P.</a> (d. 1588), also belongs to this period. His work "La guia de pecadores" may justly be styled a book full of consolation for the <a href="05525a.htm">erring</a>. His "El memorial de la vida cristiana" contains instructions which take the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> from the very beginning and lead her to the highest perfection. Louis of <a href="02602b.htm">Blois</a> (Blosius), O. S. B. (d. 1566), is of a mind kindred to St. Bernard. His "Monile spirituale" is the best known of his numerous works. <a href="14695a.htm">Thomas of Jesus</a> (d. 1582) wrote the "Passion of Christ" and "De oratione dominica".</p>

<p>A great number of ascetical writers sprang up during the seventeenth century. Among them <a href="06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> stands out most prominently. According to Linsemann, the publication of his "Philothea" was an event of historical importance. To make <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> attractive and to adapt it to all classes whether living in Court circles, in the world, or in a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, this was his aim and in this he succeeded. Of a mild and sweet temperament, he never lost sight of the habits and particular circumstances of the individual. Though unwavering in his ascetical principles, he yet possessed an admirable facility for adapting them without constraint or rigidity. In the practice of <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> he recommends moderation and adaptation to one's state of life and to personal circumstances. Love of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and of man: this he puts down as the motive power of all actions. The spirit of St. Francis pervades the whole of modern asceticism, and even today his "Philothea" is one of the most widely read books on asceticism. "Theotimus", another work of his, treats in the first six chapters of the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the rest being devoted to mystical <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. His letters, too, are very instructive. Attention may be called to the new edition of his works (Euvres, <a href="01540a.htm">Annecy</a>, 1891 sqq.). "Il combattimento spirituale" of Scupoli (d. 1610) was spread very widely and earnestly recommended by Francis de Sales.</p>

<p>To the same period belong the following authors and works. <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine, S.J.</a> (d. 1621): "Gemitus columb&aelig;"; "De ascensione mentis in Deum"; "De arte bene moriendi". Alphonsus Rodriguez, S.J. (d. 1616): "Exercicio de perfecci&oacute;n y virtudes cristianas" (3 vols., Seville, 1609), which has frequently been re-edited and translated into nearly all languages. John of Jesus-Mary, O. C. D. (d. 1615): "Teologia Mistica" (Naples, 1607), highly esteemed by <a href="02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and Francis de Sales. Alvarez de Paz, S.J. (d. 1620): "De vita spirituali ejusque perfectione" (1608); "De exterminatione mali et promotione boni" (1613); "De inquisitione pacis" (1617), which was frequently re-edited. Gaudier, S.J. (d. 1620): "De perfectione vit&aelig; spiritualis" (1619; new ed., 3 vols., Turin, 1903-4). La Puente, S.J. (d. 1624): "Guia espiritual" (Valladolid, 1609), containing, according to his own statement, a brief epitome of the spiritual life both active and contemplative (<a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, meditation, trials, <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a>, practice of virtue); "De la Perfecci&oacute;n del Cristiano en todos sus estados" (1612). Both works have ever been highly esteemed by all ascetical men and have been translated into many languages. <a href="09192a.htm">Lessius, S.J.</a>* (d. 1623): "De perfectionibus moribusque divinis", a work distinguished both for its scientific and ascetical spirit. Nlcholas Lancicius, S.J. (d. 1638), past-master in the spiritual life, whose saintly <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> is reflected in his writings (new ed., Cracow, 1889 sqq.): "De exteriore corporis compositione"; "De quatuor viis perveniendi ad perfectionem"; "De humanarum passionum dominio": "De mediis ad virtutem"; "De causis et remediis in oratione". Greatly valued is his book of meditations: "De piis erga Deum et coelites affectibus"; it has been translated into several languages. Schorrer, S.J.: "Synopsis theol. ascet." (Dillingen, 1662; rare edition). <a href="15524a.htm">Godinez, S.J.</a>*: "Pr&aacute;ctica de la teologia mystica" (La Puebla de los Angeles, 1681), of which we have a Latin edition together with a commentary by de la Reguera, S.J. (Rome, 1740).</p>

<p>Surin, S.J. (d. 1665), wrote his important "Cat&eacute;chisme spirituel" at a time when he was subject to interior trials (cf. Zahn, "Mystik", p. 441). The book appeared in many editions and translations, but was placed on the <a href="07721a.htm">Index</a>. The edition of Fr. Fellon, S.J. (1730), and the latest edition of <a href="02711e.htm">Fr. Bouix</a> (Paris, 1882) probably do not fall under this prohibition, because in them the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> have been corrected. After Surin's death appeared: Les fondements de la vie spirituelle" (Paris, 1667); "Lettres spirituelles" (ib., 1695); "Dialogues spirituels" (ib., 1704). <a href="05166c.htm">Gasper Druzbicki, S.J.</a> (d. 1662), is the author of a considerable number of <a href="14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works both in Polish and in Latin, many of which were translated into other languages. There are two complete editions of his works: one published at <a href="08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a> (1732) in two folios, the other at Kalisz and Posen (1681-91). Among his numerous works are: "Lapis lydius boni spiritus"; "Considerationes de soliditate ver&aelig; virtutis"; "De sublimitate perfectionis"; "De brevissima ad perfectionem via"; "Vota religiosa". The "Mystica theologia Divi Thom&aelig;" of <a href="15261b.htm">Thomas &agrave; Vallgornera, O.P.</a> (d. 1665), published at <a href="02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, (1662 and 1672) and at <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a> (1890), is almost exclusively made up of quotations from <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and is a rich storehouse of ascetical material. From the pen of <a href="02645b.htm">Cardinal Bona</a>, O. Cist. (d. 1674), we have: "Principia et documents vit&aelig; christian&aelig;" (Rome, 1673) and "Manuductio ad coelum" (Rome, 1672 and 1678), both of which works, remarkable for their simplicity and practical utility, were frequently re-edited; the still valuable "De sacrificio Miss&aelig;"; "De discretione spirituum"; "Horologium asceticum". Complete editions of his works appeared at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, <a href="15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Morotius, O. Cist., in his "Cursus vit&aelig; spiritualis" (Rome, 1674; new ed., Ratisbon, 1891), follows closely the lead of St. Thomas. The "Summa theologi&aelig; mystic&aelig;" (new ed., 3 vols., Freiburg, 1874) is the best and most widely read work of <a href="12007a.htm">Philip of the Blessed Trinity</a> (d. 1671), the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> among the mystic writers. He wrote in the spirit of St. Thomas, following definite scientific principles and showing their practical application in the spiritual life. Anthony of the Holy Ghost, O. C. D. (d. 1674), was a disciple of the author just named. His "Directorium mysticum" (new ed., Paris, 1904), dominated by the spirit of. his master, was written for the instruction of his pupils. He is also the author of the following works: "Seminarium virtutum" (3rd ed., <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> and <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 1750), "Irriguum virtutum" (W&uuml;rzburg, 1723), "Tractatus de clericorum ac pr&aelig;cipue sacerdotum et pastorum dignitate", etc. (W&uuml;rzburg, 1676).</p>

<p>In the course of the eighteenth century a number of valuable works on asceticism and <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> were published. To Neumeyer, S.J. (d. 1765), we owe the "Idea theol. ascet.", a complete, scientifically arranged epitome. Rogacci, S.J. (d. 1719), wrote "Del uno necessario", an instruction in the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, which ranks high in ascetical literature and was translated into several languages. Among the best literary productions, and widely read even today, is Scaramelli's (d. 1752) "Direttorio ascetico". The author treats asceticism apart from <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. A treatise on the virtues is contained in Dirkink, S.J., "Semita perfectionis" (new ed., Paderborn, 1890). Designed along broad lines is the "Trinum perfectum" (3rd ed., Augsburg, 1728) by Michael of St. Catherine. Katzenberger, O.F.M., wrote "Scientia salutis" (new ed., Paderborn, 1901). <a href="13590b.htm">Schram's</a> "Institutiones theol. mystic&aelig;" (2 vols.) combines asceticism with <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, though the author is at his best in the ascetical parts. <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> (d. 1787), rightly called the "Apostolic Man", published a large number of ascetic works, full of heavenly unction and tender-hearted <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>. The best-known and most important of them are: "Pratica di amar Ges&ugrave; Cristo" (1768), "Visita al SS. Sacramento", perhaps the most widely read of all his <a href="14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works: "La vera sposa di Ges&ugrave; Cristo" (1760), a sure guide to perfection for countless <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p>Complete treatises on asceticism, published during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, are the following: Grundk&ouml;tter, "Anleitung zur christl. Vollkommenheit" (Ratisbon, 1896). Leick, C. SS. R., "Schule der christl. Vollkommenheit" (Ratisbon, 1886), inspired by the writings of <a href="01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>. Weiss, O. P., "Philosophie der christl. Vollkommenheit" (vol. V of his "Apologie"; Freiburg 1898). The author is extraordinarily well read, and his conception of the spiritual life is unusually deep. Ribet, "L'asc&eacute;tique chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, 1888). Tissot, "La vie int&eacute;rieure". Saudreau, "Les degr&eacute;s de la vie spirituelle" (Angers, 1896 and 1897), a work full of unction. His other works, "Les faits extraordinaires de la vie spirituelle" (1908) and "La vie d'union &agrave; Dieu" (1909), belong to <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> properly so called. Poulain, S.J., "La gr&acirc;ce d'oraison", though of a mystic character, yet treats of the ordinary method of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Saudreau and Poulain are reliable throughout and their works are among the best productions in this branch. Rousset, O. P., "Directorium asceticum" (Freiburg, 1893). Meynard, O. P., "Trait&eacute; de la vie int&eacute;rieure" (Paris, 1899), based on <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. Meyer, S.J., "First Lessons in the Science of the Saints" (2nd ed., St. Louis, 1903), translated into several languages. Francis X. Mutz, "Die christliche Aszetik" (2nd ed., Paderborn, 1909). Joseph Zahn, "Einf&uuml;hrung in die christliche Mystik" (Paderborn, 1908), important also for asceticism. Berthier, "De la perfection chr&eacute;tienne et de la perfection religieuse d'apr&egrave;s S. Thomas et S. Fran&ccedil;ois de Sales" (2 vols., Paris, 1901). A. Devine, "Manual of Ascetical Theology" (London). Ryan, "Groundwork of Christian Perfection" (London). Buchanan, "Perfect Love of God" (London).</p>
