<p>(M<font size=-2>ARCIANUS,</font> <em>Marki&#226;nos</em>)</p>

<p>Roman Emperor at Constantinople, b. in Thrace about 390; d. January, 457. He became a soldier; during his early life he was poor, and it is said that he arrived at Constantinople with only two hundred pieces of gold, which he had borrowed. He served in the army under Ardaburius the Alan and his son Aspar; he distinguished himself in the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="11712a.htm">Persians</a> and Huns. Aspar was a kind of king-maker, and general- in-chief for the East (<em>magister militum per orientem</em>), also for a time the most powerful man at Constantinople. But since he was a foreigner and an <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> he could not be emperor himself. Instead he placed a succession of his favourites on the throne. On of these was Marcian. At Constantinople Marcian became a senator and was a well-known and popular <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>. He was a widower; his daughter by the first marriage, Euphemia, afterwards married Anthemius, Emperor in the West (467-472). He was about sixty years old when Theodosius II died (450).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Theodosius II (408-450) had succeeded his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, Arcadius (395-408), as a young child. During the greater part of his reign his elder sister Pulcheria managed the Government. Already during the reign of Theodosius Pulcheria was "Augusta". With her two sisters, Arcadia and Marina, she made a public <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>. When her brother died all difficulty about the succession was ended by the unanimous choice of her (who had long really guided the State) as empress. Thus began the reign of Pulcheria. Wishing to strengthen her position (it was the first case of a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> succeeding to the Roman throne) she at once made a nominal marriage with Marcian. He seems to have been the best <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> she could have chosen; the friendship of Aspar as well as his own reputation had long pointed him out for some high place. It is said that Theodosius on his death-bed had told him: "It has been revealed to me that you will succeed me." Marcian was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> by the patriarch, 25 August, 450. It is the first instance of the religious <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>, imitated later in the West, and was to have far-reaching consequences. The first act of the new reign was the trial and execution of Chrysaphius, a eunuch and court favourite long unpopular, who had brought Theodosius to a humiliating apology and the payment of a large fine by an unsuccessful conspiracy to <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> <a href="02061b.htm">Attila</a>. Marcian belonged to the party of reform, of which the founder, under Theodosius, had been <a href="01553c.htm">Anthemius</a>. As soon as he became emperor he began a policy of moderation, especially in taxation, that made his reign prosperous and himself popular, though he did little by force of arms to repress the ever-encroaching Huns and other enemies of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<p>He reduced the expenses of the treasury and Court, and did away with the <em>gleba,</em> or <em>follis,</em> an oppressive tax on <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> that was specially obnoxious to the upper classes. There was a harsh system by which any senator might be forced to accept the unwelcome <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <em>pr&aelig;tura</em>. As a pr&aelig;tor he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to live at Constantinople during his time of office, and spend large sums on providing games and shows. This was specially hard on senators who lived in the provinces, who had therefore to come to the capital and live for months there at ruinous expense. Marcian modified this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> so as to excuse people living away from the city, and he ordered the consuls to take their share of the expenses. He reformed the navy on a more economical basis. There were at that time frequent earthquakes, by which whole cities were destroyed. In these cases Marcian and Pulcheria came to the help of the sufferers generously with supplies from the imperial treasury.</p>

<p>Marcian had a conscientious <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of the responsibilities of his office. In the second <em>novella</em> of his code he defines his view of an emperor's <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>: "It is our business to provide for the care of the <a href="09580c.htm">human race</a>." And he was conscious of the distress caused by the excessive taxation and general maladministration of his predecessors. The first <em>novella</em> announces that complainants have flocked to the Government from all sides, there are "endless crowds of petitioners"; this is because of the want of "integrity and severity" in the judges. Marcian's <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> are well-meant and successful attempts to cope with these difficulties. A very popular measure was his refusal to pay to <a href="02061b.htm">Attila</a> the tribute that had been paid regularly by Theodosius II. This refusal both saved a great expense and restored the dignity of the empire that had been degraded by so great a humiliation. As the Huns were just beginning their quarrel with the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>, they could not afford to go to <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with the empire. No <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> Marcian <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> this when he defied them.</p>

<p>But the chief event of this reign was the beginning of the great <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> quarrel and the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. Marcian was conspicuously <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. As soon as he was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> he wrote a very friendly and respectful letter to <a href="09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> (440-461), whom he calls the guardian of the Faith, asking for his <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and declaring himself anxious to support the council proposed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> (<em>so&#251; a&rsquo;uthento&#251;ntos</em>) in order to settle the question raised by <a href="05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, <a href="05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a>, and their friends (ep. lxxiii among <a href="09154b.htm">St. Leo's</a> letters; <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VI, 99). Pulcheria also wrote; she too says that the council shall be summoned by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority. Leo had already asked Theodosius II to summon the council (ep. xliv, 3; P.L., LIV, 826); Marcian clearly only meant to carry out this commission as Theodosius's successor. Meanwhile <a href="05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a> and his party <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> quite well that Marcian would not be their friend. They had tried and failed to prevent his recognition in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; the attempt only made their case worse with the Government.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> had been disturbed by the <a href="05633a.htm">teaching of Eutyches</a> since immediately after the Council of Ephesus (431) and the <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> troubles. In 448 <a href="05622a.htm">Eusebius of Doryl&aelig;um</a> had accused <a href="05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> and his formula "one nature after the union" (<em>met&#224; t&#232;n &lsquo;&eacute;nosin m&#237;a ph&uacute;sis</em>) at Constantinople. <a href="05019a.htm">Dioscurus of Alexandria</a> had taken up the cause of <a href="05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, and had condemned Dyophysism at the <a href="05495a.htm">Robber Council of Ephesus</a> in 449 (for all this see <a href="10489b.htm">M<font size=-2>ONOPHYSITISM</font></a>). Pope Leo hoped for a time to restore peace without another general council (his letters to Marcian, lxxviii, to Pulcheria, lxxix, and to the Patriarch Anatolius of Constantinople, lxxx). But meanwhile Marcian, acting on Leo's former proposal, summoned a council on 17 May, 451, by letters addressed to all the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of the empire. It is clear that he acted on a misunderstanding, and had not yet received the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> later letter (<a href="07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, II, 639). Leo then accepted what had happened, and appointed as his <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> Paschasius, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lilyb&aelig;um in <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Boniface (ep. lxxxix; <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VI, 125). The council was to have met at Nic&aelig;a; many <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had already arrived there in the summer of 451, when the emperor wrote to tell them to wait till he could join them (his letter in <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VI, 553). He was busy at the frontier of the empire arranging its defence against the Huns. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> wrote to complain of the delay, and Marcian answered their letter telling them to go to <a href="03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, opposite the capital on the other side of the Bosphorus (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, V, 557); in this way he could attend to the council without leaving Constantinople.</p>

<p>The council opened in the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Euphemia at Chalcedon on 8 October, 451, and lasted till 1 November. About 600 <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> attended. The imperial commissioners were present and regulated the exterior business at each session. The <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Paschasius, opened the council. Marcian and Pulcheria assisted at the sixth session (25 October). The emperor opened the proceedings that day with a speech in Latin (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VII, 129). One notices that what was still the official language of the empire was used on specially solemn occasions. His speech was then repeated in Greek. At this session the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of the council was read (see <a href="03555a.htm">C<font size=-2>HALCEDON</font></a>.) On 27 February, 452, Marcian, together with his Western colleague, <a href="15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a> (423-455), made a law enforcing the <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> and canons of the council as the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of the empire, and threatening heavy penalties against all who disputed them. Marcian alone repeated the same law on 13 March (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VII, 475- 480). The famous twenty-eighth canon (giving Constantinople rank immediately after <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>) and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> protest against it caused further correspondence between him and the emperor and empress (Ep. Leonis I., cv, cvi; <a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VI, 187, 195), but did not disturb their good relations. Marcian's <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> produced uniformity at Constantinople and in the neighbourhood of the Government, but he could not enforce them so successfully in <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The rest of his reign was troubled by the revolution in these provinces, which remained one of the chief difficulties of the Government under his successors for two centuries. Marcian made no concessions towards the Syrian and <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. His Government carried out the deposition of <a href="05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a>, and an edict of 28 July, 452, insisted under heavy penalties on the recognition of Proterius, the Orthodox <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>. A large force (2000 soldiers) was sent to <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. It was not until after Marcian's death that a party at Constantinople under Aspar and Anatolius began to compromise with the <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>In the year 453 <a href="02061b.htm">Attila</a> died. It is said that Marcian dreamed, at the moment of <a href="02061b.htm">Attila's</a> death, that he saw the bow of his great enemy broken. The Empress Pulcheria died in the same year. She is <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by both <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and Orthodox; her <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is on 10 September in both <a href="03158a.htm">calendars</a>. Marcian survived his wife four years. The end of his reign was occupied by the increasing troubles in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. He was succeeded by <a href="09154b.htm">Leo I</a> (457-474). Marcian was, by marriage, the last emperor of the House of <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a>. The Orthodox have <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> him also, and keep his feast (with Pulcheria) on 17 February.</p>
