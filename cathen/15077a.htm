<p>This article will treat of Catholic Truth Societies in the chronological order of their establishment in various countries.</p>

<h2>In England</h2>

<p>The Catholic Truth Society has had two periods of existence. It was initiated by <a href="15311b.htm">Dr. (afterwards Cardinal) Vaughan</a> when he was Rector of St. Joseph's Missionary College, and, in the two or three years of its existence, issued a number of leaflets and penny books, some of which are still on sale; but when he became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13399a.htm">Salford</a>, in 1872, the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> fell into abeyance and soon practically ceased to exist. Meanwhile, and quite independently, the need of cheap, good literature impressed itself upon some <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>, who raised the sum of twelve pounds, which was expended in printing some little cards of <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> for daily use, and for confession and Communion. The scheme was brought before Dr. Vaughan, who suggested that the new body should take the name and place of the defunct Catholic Truth Society. Under that name it was formally established, 5 November, 1884, and the second period of its existence began under the presidency of Dr. Vaughan, the Rev. W.H. (now Monsignor) Cologan and Mr. James Britten being appointed honorary secretaries. At the death of Cardinal Vaughan, the present <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, Cardinal Bourne, became president. The aims of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> are: To spread among <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> small devotional works; to assist the uneducated poor to a better <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their religion; to spread among <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> information regarding <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and practice; and to promote the circulation of good and cheap <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature. These objects have been steadily kept in view throughout the <a href="14074a.htm">society's</a> existence, although its scope has from time to time been enlarged as necessity has dictated. From them it will be seen that the aim of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> is not controversial, as is sometimes supposed. The position of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> is such that controversy is unavoidable, and a certain proportion of the <a href="14074a.htm">society's</a> publications have been devoted to the consideration of the <a href="01498a.htm">Anglican</a> claims and to the exposure of the fictions assiduously promoted by the less intelligent and bigoted class of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. But the chief aim of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> has been the instruction of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by placing in their hands, at nominal prices, <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> and devotional works. The sale of some of these has been phenomenal: the &quot;Simple Prayer-book&quot;, for example, has reached a circulation of 1,380,000; the little penny books of daily meditation have reached 114,000; and nearly 200,000 penny copies of the Gospels have been sold. An account of the literary output of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> can be ascertained from the list of publications, to be obtained from the depot, 69 Southwark Bridge Road, London, S.E. Almost every subject of importance to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is taken up in one or other of the <a href="14074a.htm">society's</a> works; and the number is increasing every month. Already there is an extensive list of books and pamphlets directed to meet and answer <a href="12652a.htm">rationalist</a> objections; among them may be mentioned a series of penny lives of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> men of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, and thirty-nine papers dealing with &quot;The History of Religions&quot;; of these last an aggregate of about 200,000 copies have been issued. For younger <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> a large number of tales, dealing with the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and other religious subjects, has been provided at the lowest possible price.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> is mainly supported by subscriptions, ten shillings per annum entitling to membership, while ten pounds is a life subscription. Without these the work could not be carried on, as, although the officers have always taken their part gratuitously, the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> expenses of rent, printing, and storing could not be defrayed out of the often infinitesimal profits accruing from the sale of publications. From the first there has been the heartiest co-operation between <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> in every branch of the <a href="14074a.htm">society's</a> work; and the difficulties often arising from political differences have never in any way interfered with the work of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> has the cordial approval and support of the highest <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, and is <a href="07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The movement has spread to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>, and Australia. In addition to its literary work, for seventeen years the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> held an annual <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> conference, which formed an important event in English <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life. These gatherings, always largely attended by representative <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, were the occasion of important pronouncements by the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> or by other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and afforded an opportunity for the elucidation and discussion of matters affecting the work and welfare of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. Their success paved the way for a development by which, from 1910, the <a href="14074a.htm">society's</a> conference has been merged in the National <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress. The important work of providing reading for blind <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> has been taken up by the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, which has established a circulating <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of books of instruction, devotion, and fiction, printed in Braille type. It has also provided a number of lectures on matters connected with history and art, illustrated by suitable lantern slides. A special committee was formed in 1891 to work for the spiritual welfare of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> seamen of all classes, through the instrumentality of which <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> seamen's clubs and homes were opened. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> has also been the starting-point for other organizations which now have an independent existence &mdash; e.g. the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Guardians' Association, which has become a centre of usefulness throughout the country, is the ultimate development of a local branch of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, which made the distribution of literature to the inmates of workhouses and <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> part of its work; the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Social Guild took its rise in connection with one of the <a href="14074a.htm">society's</a> conferences; and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Needlework Guild was initiated by one of its secretaries. The realization of its importance is already growing, and the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> is doing effective work for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>.</p>

<h2>In Ireland</h2>

<p>The Catholic Truth Society of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was organized at the meeting of the Maynooth-Union in 1899, with the stated purpose of diffusing &quot;by means of cheap publications sound <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature in popular form so as to give instruction and edification in a manner most likely to interest and attract the general reader&quot;, and which would &quot;create a taste for a pure and wholesome literature, and will also serve as an antidote against the poison of dangerous or immoral writings&quot;. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> has received the earnest and practical support of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and has devoted its publications to sound national, historical, and biographical, as well as religious subjects in order to offset the demoralization of the output of the sensational press. In the first ten years of its existence 424 penny publications, with a circulation of over five million copies, were issued. It has also printed a <a href="12350a.htm">prayer-book</a> and other works in Gaelic. The annual conferences have brought together distinguished gatherings, and the addresses made and papers read at these meetings, printed in &quot;The Catholic Truth Annual&quot;, make a valuable compilation in the interest of the object for which the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> was started. The <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> has its main office in <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a> and has over 800 members.</p>

<h2>In Australia</h2>

<p>The Australian Catholic Truth Society was started in 1904, and has its headquarters in <a href="10155a.htm">Melbourne</a>. Its officers have been active in the dissemination of sound <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature and in the spreading of publications that were an antidote to works subversive of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>. On 1 Nov., 1910 the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> had 423 annual and 164 life members distributed over the Commonwealth and New Zealand and had published 679,375 pamphlets. Of its <a href="12350a.htm">prayer-book</a> 42,016 copies were sold. In 1910 it sent the Rev. Dr. Cleary on a mission around the world to establish a chain of agents for an international news service.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>In the United States</h2>

<p>The International Catholic Truth Society was incorporated in New York on 24 April, 1900, the particular objects for which it was formed being: to answer inquiries of <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> seeking information concerning the doctrines of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; to supply <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature gratis to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics who make request for the same; to correct <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> and misleading statements in reference to <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>; to refute <a href="03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion; to secure the publication of articles promoting a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs; to stimulate a desire for higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> among the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>, by printing and distributing lists of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books, and otherwise to encourage the circulation and reading of standard <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature; to generally assist in the dissemination of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>; and to perform other <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> and missionary work. The territory in which its operations are principally conducted is in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States of America</a> and in <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The office of the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> is in <a href="02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of which <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is its honorary president, and the Rev. W. N. McGinnis. S.T.D., its president.</p>

<p>According to the annual report for the year from March, 1910, to March, 1911, the <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> had 1005 members, 618 subscribers, and 118 affiliated <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>. It had distributed during the year 199,188 pamphlets. A part of its work found to be of special benefit is the remailing of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers and magazines to people in out of the way sections. During the year 11,579 such <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> were supplied with 475,000 copies of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly papers and magazines. <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> items are supplied twice a month to 31 daily papers in various parts of the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. In affiliation with this <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, and acting as distributing centres, 94 Councils of the <a href="08670c.htm">Knights of Columbus</a> and 24 other organizations in various localities have been of material assistance in refuting <a href="03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, in publishing in the daily press articles that tend to promote a <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs; in securing the removal of objectionable textbooks from the public <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, or the expurgation from the textbooks of <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> and <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> statements concerning the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; and generally assisting in the dissemination of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>.
