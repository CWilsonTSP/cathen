<h1>Private Revelations</h1>

<p>There are two kinds of revelations: (1) universal revelations, which are contained in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> or in the <em>depositum</em> of <a href="15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a> transmitted by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. These ended with the preaching of the Apostles and must be believed by all; (2) particular or private revelations which are constantly occurring among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> (see <a href="04324b.htm">CONTEMPLATION</a>). When the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> approves private revelations, she declares only that there is nothing in them contrary <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> or good <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, and that they may be read without danger or even with profit; no <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> is thereby imposed on the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> to believe them. Speaking of such revelations as (e.g.) those of <a href="07351a.htm">St. Hildegard</a> (approved in part by Eugenius III), St. Bridget (by <a href="02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>), and <a href="03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> (by <a href="06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>) <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> says: "It is not <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> nor even possible to give them the assent of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, but only of human <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, in conformity with the dictates of <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a>, which presents them to us as probable and worthy of pius <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>)" (De canon., III, liii, xxii, II).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Illusions connected with private revelations have been explained in the article <a href="04324b.htm">CONTEMPLATION</a>. Some of them are at first thought surprising. Thus a vision of an historical scene (e.g., of the life or death of Christ) is often only approximately accurate, although the visionary may be unaware of this fact, and he may be misled, if he believes in its absolute historical fidelity. This <a href="05525a.htm">error</a> is quite natural, being based on the assumption that, if the vision comes from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, all its details (the landscape, dress, words, actions, etc.) should be a faithful reproduction of the historical past. This assumption is not justified, for accuracy in secondary details is not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a>; the main point is that the fact, event, or communication revealed be strictly <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>. It may be objected that the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> contains historical books, and that thus <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> may sometimes wish to reveal certain facts in <a href="07365a.htm">religious history</a> to us exactly. That doubtless is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, when there is question of facts which are <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> or useful as a basis for religion, in which case the revelation is accompanied by <a href="12454c.htm">proofs</a> that guarantee its accuracy. A vision need not guarantee its accuracy in every detail. One should thus beware of concluding without examination that revelations are to be rejected; the prudent course is neither to believe nor to deny them unless there is sufficient reason for so doing. Much less should one suspect that the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> have been always, or very often deceived in their vision. On the contrary, such deception is rare, and as a rule in unimportant matters only.</p>

<p>There are cases in which we can be certain that a revelation is Divine. (1) <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> can give this <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a> to the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who receives the revelation (at least during it), by granting an insight and an evidence so compelling as to exclude all possibility of <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a>. We can find an analogy in the natural order: our senses are subject to many illusions, and yet we frequently perceive clearly that we have not been deceived. (2) At times others can be equally certain of the revelation thus vouchsafed. For instance, the Prophets of the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> gave indubitable signs of their mission; otherwise they would not have been believed. There were always <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who deceived some of the people but, inasmuch as the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a> were counselled by <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a> to distinguish the <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> from the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, it was possible so to distinguish. One incontrovertible <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> is the working of a <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a>, if it be wrought for this purpose and circumstances show this to be so. A prophecy realized is equally convincing, when it is precise and cannot be the result of chance or of a conjecture of the <a href="04710a.htm">evil spirit</a>.</p>

<p>Besides these rather rare means of forming an opinion, there is another, but longer and more intricate method: to discuss the reasons for and against. Practically, this examination will often give only a probability more or less great. It may be also that the revelation can be regarded as Divine in its broad outlines, but <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> in minor details. Concerning the revelations of <a href="01229a.htm">Marie de Agreda</a> and <a href="05406b.htm">Anne Catherine Emmerich</a>, for example, contradictory opinions have been expressed: some believe unhesitatingly everything they contain, and are annoyed when anyone does not share their confidence; others give the revelations no credence whatsoever (generally on a priori grounds); finally there are many who are sympathetic, but do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> what to reply when asked what degree of credibility is to be attributed to the writings of these two <a href="05277a.htm">ecstatics</a>. The <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> seems to be between the two extreme opinions indicated first. If there is question of a particular fact related in these books and not mentioned elsewhere, we cannot be certain that it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, especially in minor details. In particular instances, these visionaries have been mistaken: thus <a href="01229a.htm">Marie de Agreda</a> teaches, like her contemporaries, the existence of crystal heavens, and declares that one must believe everything she says, although such an <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> exists only in the case of the <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>. In 1771 <a href="04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> forbade the continuation of her process of <a href="02364b.htm">beatification</a> "on account of the book". <a href="05406b.htm">Catherine Emmerich</a> has likewise given expression to <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> or unlikely opinions: she regards the writings of the <a href="05013a.htm">pseudo-Dionysius</a> as due to the Areopagite, and says strange things about the <a href="14519a.htm">terrestrial Paradise</a>, which, according to her, exists on an inaccessible Mountain towards <a href="14718a.htm">Tibet</a>. If there be question of the general statement of facts given in these works, we can admit with probability that many of them are <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>. For these two visionaries led lives that were regarded as very holy. Competent authorities have judged their <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> as divine. It is therefore prudent to admit that they received a special assistance from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, preserving them not absolutely, but in the main, from <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In judging of revelations or visions we may proceed in this manner: (1) get detailed information about the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who believes himself thus favored; (2) also about the fact of the revelation and the circumstances attending it. To prove that a revelation is Divine (at least in its general outlines), the method of exclusion is sometimes employed. It consists in proving that neither the <a href="04710a.htm">demon</a> nor the <a href="05277a.htm">ecstatic's</a> own <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> have interfered (at least on important points) with <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> action, and that no one has retouched the revelation after its occurrence. This method differs from the preceding one only in the manner of arranging the information obtained, but it is not so convenient. To judge revelations or visions, we must be acquainted with the character of the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> favoured with them from a triple point of view: natural, ascetical, and mystical. (For those who have been <a href="02364b.htm">beatified</a> or <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a>, this inquiry has been already made by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.) Our inquiry into the visionary's character might be pursued as follows:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>What are his natural qualities or defects, from a physical, <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, and especially moral standpoint? If the information is favourable (if the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> is of sound judgment, calm <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a>; if his acts are dictated by reason and not by enthusiasm, etc.), many causes of illusion are thereby excluded. However, a momentary aberration is still possible.</li><li>How has the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> been <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a>? Can the <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the visionary have been derived from books or from conversations with <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a>?</li><li>What are the virtues exhibited before and after the revelation? Has he made progress in <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> and especially in <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>? The tree can be judged by its fruits.</li><li>What extraordinary <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> of union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> have been received? The greater they are the greater the probability in favour of the revelation, at least in the main.</li><li>Has the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> had other revelations that have been judged Divine? Has he made any predictions that have been clearly realized?</li><li>Has he been subjected to heavy trials? It is almost impossible for extraordinary favours to be conferred without heavy crosses; for both are marks of <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> friendship, and each is a preparation for the other.</li><li>Does he practice the following rules: fear deception; be open with your director; do not desire to have revelations?   </li></ol></div>

<p>Our information concerning a revelation considered in itself or concerning the circumstances that accompanied it might be secured as follows:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>Is there an authentic account, in which nothing has been added, suppressed, or corrected?</li><li>Does the revelation agree with the teaching of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> or with the recognized facts of history or natural <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>?</li><li>Does it teach nothing contrary to good <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, and is it unaccompanied by any indecent action? The <a href="04153a.htm">commandments of God</a> are addressed to everyone without exception. More than once the <a href="04710a.htm">demon</a> has persuaded <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> visionaries that they were chosen <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, and that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="09397a.htm">loved</a> them so much as to dispense them from the burdensome restrictions imposed on ordinary mortals. On the contrary, the effect of Divine visitations is to remove us more and more from the life of sense, and make us more rigorous towards ourselves.</li><li>Is the reaching helpful towards the obtaining of <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>? In <a href="14221a.htm">spiritism</a> we find the spirits evoked treat only of trifles. They reply to idle questions, or descend to providing amusement for an assembly (e.g., by moving furniture about); deceased relatives or the great <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are interrogated and their replies are woefully commonplace. A revelation is also suspect if its aim is to decide a disputed question in <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, history, <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, etc. <a href="13407a.htm">Eternal salvation</a> is the only thing of importance in the eyes of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. "In all other matters", says <a href="08480a.htm">St. John of the Cross</a>, "He wishes men to have recourse to human means" (Mont&eacute;e, II, xxii). Finally, a revelation is suspect if it is commonplace, telling only what is to be found in every book. It is then probable that the visionary is unconsciously repeating what he has learnt by reading.</li><li>After examining all the circumstances accompanying the vision (the attitudes, acts, words, etc.), do we find that the dignity and seriousness which become the Divine Majesty? The spirits evoked by Spiritists often speak in a trivial manner. Spiritists try to explain this by pretending that the spirits are not <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a>, but the <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed who have retained all their vices; absurd or unbecoming replies are given by deceased <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who are still liars, or libertines, frivolous or mystifiers, etc. But if that be so, communications with these degraded beings is evidently dangerous. In <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> "revivals" assembled crowds bewail their <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>, but in a strange, exaggerated way, as if frenzied or intoxicated. It must be admitted that they are inspired by a good principle: a very ardent sentiment of the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and of repentance. But to this is added another element that cannot be regarded as Divine: a neuropathic enthusiasm, which is contagious and sometimes develops so far as to produce convulsions or repugnant contortions. Sometimes a kind of unknown language is spoken, but it consists in reality of a succession of meaningless sounds.</li><li>What sentiments of peace, or, on the other hand, of disturbance, are experienced during or after the revelations? Here is the rule as formulated by <a href="03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> and St. Ignatius: "With <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of good will [it is only of such that we are here treating] the action of the good spirit [<a href="06608a.htm">God</a> or His <a href="01476d.htm">Angels</a>] is characterized by the production of peace, <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a>, security, <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>; except perhaps at the first moment." Note the restriction. The Bible often mentions this disturbance at the first moment of the revelation; the Blessed Virgin experienced it when the <a href="06330a.htm">Angel Gabriel</a> appeared to her. The action of the <a href="04710a.htm">demon</a> produces quite the contrary effect: "With <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of good will he produces, except perhaps at the first moment, disturbance, sorrow, discouragement, perturbation, gloom." In a word the action of <a href="04764a.htm">Satan</a> encounters a mysterious resistance of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>.</li><li>It often happens that the revelation inspires an exterior work - for instance, the establishment of a new devotion, the foundation of a new religious congregation or association, the revision of the constitutions of a congregation, etc., the building of a church or the creation of a <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, the reformation of the lax spirit in a certain body, the preaching of a new spirituality, etc. In these cases the value of the proposed work must be carefully examined; is it good in itself, useful, filling a need, not injurious to other works, etc.?</li><li>Have the revelations been subjected to the tests of time and discussion?</li><li>If any work has been begun as a result of the revelation, has it produced great spiritual fruit? Have the <a href="12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a> and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> believed this to be so, and have they assisted the progress of the work? This is very well illustrated in the cases of the <a href="13508b.htm">Scapular</a> of Mount Carmel, the devotion to the Sacred Heart, the <a href="10115a.htm">miraculous medal</a>. These are the signs that enable us to judge with probability if a revelation is Divine. In the case of certain <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> very closely united to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the slow study of these signs has been sometimes aided or replaced by a <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="08082b.htm">intuition</a>; this is what is known as the infused gift of the discernment of spirits. </li></ol></div>

<p>As regards the rules of conduct, the two principal have been explained in the article on <a href="04324b.htm">CONTEMPLATION</a>, namely</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>if the revelation leads solely to the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, the director may provisionally regard it as Divine;</li><li>at the beginning the visionary should do his best to repulse the revelation quietly. He should not desire to receive it, otherwise he will be exposing himself to the risk of being deceived.</li></ol></div>

<p>Here are some further rules:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>the director must be content to proceed slowly, not to express astonishment, to treat the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> gently. If he were to be harsh or distrustful, he would intimidate the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> he is directing, and incline it to conceal important details from him;</li><li>he must be very careful to urge the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> to make progress in the way of <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. He will point out that the only value of the visions is in the spiritual fruit that they produce;</li><li>he will <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> fervently, and have the subject he is directing <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a>, that the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> light may be granted. <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> cannot fail to make known the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> path to those who ask Him humbly. If on the contrary a <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> confided solely in his natural <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a>, he would expose himself to punishment for his self-sufficiency;</li><li>the visionary should be perfectly calm and patient if his superiors do not allow him to carry out the enterprises that he deems inspired by <a href="07170a.htm">Heaven</a> or revealed. One who, when confronted with this opposition, becomes impatient or discouraged, shows that he has very little confidence in the power of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and is but little conformed to His will. If <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> wishes the project to succeed, He can make the obstacles suddenly disappear at the time appointed by Him. A very striking example of this divine delay is to be found in the life of <a href="08555a.htm">St. Juliana</a>, the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="12428a.htm">prioress</a> of Mont-Cornillon, near <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> (1192-1258). It is to her that the institution of the feast of the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is due. All of her life was passed in awaiting the hour of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, which she was never to see, for it came only more than a century after the beginning of the revelations. </li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As regards inspirations ordinarily, those who have not passed the period of tranquility or a complete union, must beware of the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> that they hear <a href="14336b.htm">supernatural</a> words; unless the evidence is irresistible, they should attribute them to the activity of their own imaginations. But they may at least experience inspirations or impulses more or less strong, which seem to point out to them how to act in difficult circumstances. This is a minor form of revelation. The same line of conduct should be followed as in the latter case. We must not accept them blindly and against the dictates of reason, but weigh the reasons for and against, consult a prudent director, and decide only after applying the rules for the discernment of spirits. The attitude of reserve that has just been laid down does not apply to the simple, sudden and illuminating views of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, which enables one to understand in a higher manner not novelties, but the <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> admitted by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such enlightenment cannot have any <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> result. It is on the contrary a very precious grace, which should be very carefully welcomed and utilized.</p>
