<p>The University of Rome must be distinguished from the "Studium Generale apud Curiam", established by <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> in 1244-5 at <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> for the convenience of the members of the pontifical Court and of the <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> who flocked from all over the world to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The Studium comprised the faculties of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and of canon and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>. Clerics and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> could not only attend the lectures in the latter branch, but were allowed to teach it, despite the prohibition of <a href="07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>. The Studium accompanied the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> on all their journeys and was thus transferred to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. In accordance with the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Council of Vienne, the Studium Curi&aelig; was the first, owing to the generosity of <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, to establish chairs of Arabic, Hebrew and Chaldaic; there was, moreover, a professor of <a href="01736b.htm">Armenian</a>. At <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> professorships of medicine were also instituted. During the Schism both the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and those at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> had a Studium Generale; but in the former <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> alone was taught. In the fifteenth century the Studium Generale was abolished in favour of the University of Rome. Previously King Charles of Anjou, out of gratitude for his election as senator of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had decided, 14 October, 1265, to erect a Studium Generale "tam utriusque juris quam artium" (of civil and canon law and of arts), but his plan was not carried into execution. The real founder of the University of Rome was <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (<a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In suprem&aelig;" of 20 April, 1303), who established it in order that <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the recipient of so many Divine favours, might become the fruitful mother of <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. The chief source of revenue of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was the tribute which <a href="14747b.htm">Tivoli</a> and Rispampano paid the City of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It is worthy of note that a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of law already existed in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the thirteenth century.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The transference of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> Court to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> did not at first injure the Studium Generale. <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> took a deep interest in it, but limited the granting of degrees to the two faculties of law. The Vicar of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was to preside at the examinations; to obtain a degree the Candidate had to study six years (five for canon law) and profess the same for two years. There exist documents from the year 1369 showing that degrees were then granted. But later, in the days of <a href="01452a.htm">anarchy</a> that overtook the city, the Studium gradually decayed. In 1363 the <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> were reformed; among other changes, provision was made for obtaining foreign professors, who would be independent of the various factions in the city. In 1370, however, or a little later, the Studium was entirely closed. Towards the end of the century the Roman Commune tried to restore the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> by offering very large salaries to the professors. <a href="08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a> in 1406 gave it new <a href="09053a.htm">statutes</a> and arranged with <a href="09614a.htm">Manuel Chrysoloras</a> to accept the chair of Greek literature. But the death of <a href="08019a.htm">Innocent</a> and the subsequent political and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> troubles frustrated this plan. The real restorer of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was <a href="05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> (10 October 1431). He drew up regulations for the liberty and immunity of the professors and students, and increased the revenues by adding to them the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> imposed on wines imported from abroad. For the purpose of government, four <em>reformatores</em>, Roman citizens, were appointed to assist the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a>. The position of chancellor was given to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>-<a href="03217a.htm">camerlengo</a>. The <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was located near the <a href="03041a.htm">Church</a> of Sant' Eustachio, where it had first been established. The first college for poor students was the Collegium Capranica (1458 see <a href="13131a.htm">ROMAN COLLEGES</a>); but the later plan of establishing another was not realized. The Studium of law soon flourished; but the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, on account of the competition of the Studium Curi&aelig;, was not so successful. Under <a href="11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> the classical studies developed rapidly owing to the labours of Lorenzo Valla, Poggio Bracciolini, Bruni, Francesco Filelfo, Pomponio Leto, and the Greeks, Lascaris, Chalcocondylas, and <a href="10659a.htm">Musuros</a>. But the process against the Academia Romana under <a href="11578a.htm">Paul II</a> reacted on the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. <a href="14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> intended to suppress it and reduced the salaries of the professors. Better days returned with <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, who began the present building of the Sapienza, which was remodelled in the seventeenth century. It seems, however, that it was <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> who suppressed the Studium Curi&aelig; in favour of the University of Rome. In 1514 the latter had 88 professors: 4 of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, 11 of canon law, 20 of <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>, 15 of medicine, the remainder teaching philosophy, mathematics, rhetoric, grammar, and botany. Lectures were given even on feast days. The number of students was very small, being frequently less than the number of professors. The blame is to be laid on the latter, whose other official and professional <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> interfered with their lectures. <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a> established in the Campidoglio a chair of Roman history, the lectures to be open to the public; the first to fill the position was Evangelista Maddaleni Capodiferro. Leo also granted a new constitution to the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> the professors to hold a "circle" with the students after their lectures, forbade them to exercise any other profession, and imposed a penalty for lectures omitted. He appointed three <a href="03341a.htm">cardinals protectors</a> of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of the occurrences of 1527, the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> remained closed during the entire pontificate of <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>. <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a> immediately after his accession reopened it, obtaining distinguished professors, such as Lainez, S.J., for <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, Faber, S.J., for Scripture, <a href="04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> for <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and Accorambono for medicine. It is from this date that the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> assumed the name of the Sapienza (a name used previously elsewhere, as at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>). In 1539 the professors numbered 24; 2 of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, 8 of canon and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>, 5 of medicine (one teaching <a href="01457e.htm">anatomy</a> and one botany), 5 of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, 3 of Latin, and 1 of Greek literature. <a href="08564a.htm">Julius III</a> entrusted the administration to a congregation of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. <a href="12130a.htm">Pius V</a> enlarged the botanical garden of medical herbs previously established near the Vatican by <a href="11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, and allowed the bodies of condemned infidels to be used for the purposes of anatomical study. He also established chairs of Hebrew and mathematics. A mineralogical museum (the "Metalloteca" which was after abandoned) was founded in the Vatican. Under <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> adjunct chairs with salary attached were established for the young <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who might later become ordinary professors. In that and the following centuries the professors of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> were generally the procurators general of the various <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> granted 22,000 scudi to extinguish the <a href="04663b.htm">debt</a> encumbering the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. He gave to the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of consistorial advocates the exclusive right of electing the <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> who, until then, had been elected by the professors and the students, and he instituted a congregation of <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, "Pro Universitate Studii Romani". At the end of the sixteenth century the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> began to decline, especially in the faculties of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and literature. This was due in part to the formidable concurrence of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in their Collegio Romano, where the flower of the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> was engaged in teaching. Moreover, <a href="12159a.htm">Plato</a> was the favoured master in the Sapienza, while <a href="01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> was more generally followed elsewhere. Among the distinguished professors in this century besides those already mentioned were Tommaso de Vio, O.P., later the celebrated Cardinal Gaetano; Domenico Jacovazzi; Felice Peretti (<a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>); Marco Antonio Muret, professor of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and elegant Latinist; Bartolomeo Eustacchio, the famous anatomist.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the seventeenth century the decline was rapid. Many of the professors had the privilege of lecturing only when they pleased; most of them were foreigners. The medical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> alone continued to prosper owing to the labours of Cesalpino and Lancisi. The Academia dei Lincei promoted the study of the natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> and was <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> by <a href="03408d.htm">Benedettino Castelli</a>, the disciple and friend of <a href="06342b.htm">Galilei</a>, and Andrea Argoli; later Vito Giordani the mathematician attracted many students. Only two jurisconsults of note are found during this century, Farinacci and <a href="06733b.htm">Gravina</a>. Giuseppe Carpani brought the students together at his home to familiarize them with the practice of law. The most important event of the century occurred in 1660, under <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> (1655-67), when the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> buildings begun by <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> (1492-1503) were completed. <a href="01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> established moreover the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> (the Alexandrine Library) by obtaining from the <a href="04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a> Minors of Urbania, whom he compensated by giving them permanently the chair of ethics, the printed books from the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of the Dukes of <a href="15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. In addition he founded six new chairs, among which was that of controversial <a href="07365a.htm">church history</a>, first filled by the Portuguese Francesco Macedo. <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> erected a fine anatomical hall. The most celebrated and relatively speaking most frequented <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> were those of the Oriental languages. Under <a href="08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> a move was made to suppress the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> and assign the buildings to the <a href="13588a.htm">Piarists</a> for the free <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of young boys. Fortunately the plan was not only not executed but resulted in a radical reform and the introduction (1700) of a new regime which benefited in particular the faculty of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>.</p>

<p><a href="04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> purchased (1703) with his private funds some fields on the Janiculum, where he established a botanical garden, which soon became the most celebrated in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> through the labours of the brothers Trionfetti. <a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, who had been a professor and <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> (1706-19), <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in 1744 new regulations concerning especially the vacations, the order of examinations, and the selection of professors, which was to be by competitive examination, whereas from the time of <a href="08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> they were ordinarily appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Another Edict (1748) dealt with the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of the professors and established chairs of chemistry, botany, and experimental physics. The following chairs were then in existence: 6 of <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>; 6 of medicine; 15 of arts (including <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>). In 1778 the <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> were divided into five classes: <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, 5 chairs; <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, 6; medicine, 9; philosophy and arts, 5; languages (Latin, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac). But a <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of that time deplored the inertia of the professors and the laziness of the students. <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (1804) founded the mineralogical and natural history museum, and in 1806 a chair of veterinary <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. From 1809 till 1813 the French system was in force. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1824 established the Congregation of Studies, and gave it control of the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> in the pontifical state. Many professors at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> as at Bologna had to resign their chairs on account of their political opinions, which resulted in the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> failing to keep pace with the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> in other states, for instance, the chairs of public and commercial law were not founded till 1848; and that of political economy still later. Among the distinguished professors of the eighteenth century were the jurists, Fagnano, Renazzi (also the historian of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>), Petrocchi; the professors of medicine, Baglivi Tozzi, Pascoli; the mathematician, Quartaroni; the Syrian scholar, Assemani; and <a href="10196b.htm">Menzini</a> and Fontanini the litt&eacute;rateurs; in the nineteenth century the Abbate Tortolini and Chelini, mathematicians. In 1870 there were 6 professors of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, 8 of law, 2 of notarial art, 13 of medicine, 4 of pharmacy, 11 of surgery, 3 of veterinary <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, 15 of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and mathematics, 8 of Italian and classical philology, and 4 of Oriental languages. Under the new Government all the professors who refused to take the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance were dismissed, among those refusing being the entire <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> staff. These alone then formed the pontifical <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, which came to an end in 1876.</p>

<p>The <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> is now under the control of the Italian Government and is called the Royal University. Its present state is as follows: philosophy and letters, chairs ordinary, 23, extraordinary, 3; tutors, 13; physics and mathematics, chairs ordinary, 23, extraordinary, 7; tutors, 16; law, chairs ordinary, 16; tutors, 8; medicine, chairs ordinary, 20, extraordinary, 2; tutors, 15; philosophy and letters, professors, 33; docents, 33; physics and mathematics, professors, 34 (with 4 assistants); docents, 41; law professors, 17; docents, 36; medicine, professors, 35; docents, 98. Annexed to the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> are <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, literature, and natural <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>, arch&aelig;ology, <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> and modern art, Oriental languages, pharmacy, and applied engineering. There are also institutes of pedagogy, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, zoology, botany, <a href="01457e.htm">anatomy</a>, anthropology, geology, physiology, the <a href="02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory of the Campidoglio, many medical institutes and clinics, and finally the Alexandrine <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>. The number of students in 1909-10 was 3686. Owing to the growth of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> after 1870, the building of the Sapienza was insufficient, consequently the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of physical and natural <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a> had to be located elsewhere.</p>
