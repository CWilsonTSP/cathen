<p>(CANTUARIA&mdash;Roman name, DUROVERNUM, whence, in Anglo-Saxon times, DUROVERNIA; canonical name CANTUARIENSIS).</p>

<p>The Ancient Diocese of Canterbury was the Mother-Church and <a href="12423b.htm">Primatial</a> <a href="05001a.htm">See</a> of <a href="05445a.htm">All England</a>, from 597 till the death of the last <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, <a href="12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, in 1558.</p>

<h2>Foundation of the see</h2>

<p>When <a href="02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was sent to evangelize <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, he found an opening for his labours in the fact that &AElig;thelburga, or <a href="02519a.htm">Bertha</a>, Queen of &AElig;thelberht, King of Kent, was a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a disciple of <a href="07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>. This led him to Canterbury, where he converted the king and many thousands of Saxons in 597, the very year of his landing. Though <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> had planned the division of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> into two archbishoprics, one at <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> and one at <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, <a href="02081a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> success at Canterbury explains how the southern <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> came to be fixed there instead of at <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. The first beginnings of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> are told by <a href="02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> (Hist. Eccl., I, xxxiii). "When <a href="02081a.htm">Augustine</a>, the first <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Canterbury, assumed the episcopal throne in that royal city, he recovered therein, by the King's assistance, a church which, as he was told, had been constructed by the original labour of Roman believers. This church he <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the name of the Saviour, our <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and Lord <a href="08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and there he established an habitation for himself and all his successors".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>The archbishops</h2>

<p>There were in all sixty-eight <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> during the period, just short of a thousand years, in which Canterbury was the chief <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> see in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. In the following list the dates of some of the earlier <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> cannot be regarded as critically certain, but are those usually given. Those marked with an asterisk became <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>.</p>

<p>Of this list seventeen <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> were recognized as <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, nine were <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and twelve became Lord Chancellors of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The full title of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of all <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of the Province, and Diocesan of the Diocese. In documents he was described as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> <em>providentia divina</em>, instead of <em>permissione divina</em>, as was usual with other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<h2>Metropolitan rights</h2>

<p>The organization of the province was, of course, a matter of gradual growth, and therefore the number and the names of the suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> in the earlier periods vary very much, as does the extent of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. At the height of its power Canterbury counted seventeen suffragan <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>: Bangor, <a href="02347b.htm">Bath and Wells</a>, <a href="03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, Coventry and Lichfield, <a href="05396a.htm">Ely</a>, <a href="05708a.htm">Exeter</a>, <a href="07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, <a href="09315c.htm">Llandaff</a>, Lincoln, London, <a href="11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, Rochester, <a href="01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>, St. David's, <a href="13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, <a href="15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, and <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a>. To these were added five of the six sees founded under <a href="07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in 1541 and afterwards recognized by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> under Mary (1553-1558), viz., <a href="02790b.htm">Bristol</a>, Gloucester, <a href="11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, <a href="11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>, and Westminster. Several of these <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> acted on state occasions as the <em>curia</em> of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Thus the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> acted as his dean; Winchester was his chancellor; Lincoln his vice-chancellor; Salisbury his <a href="12372a.htm">precentor</a>; <a href="15703a.htm">Worcester</a> his <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a>; and <a href="13102a.htm">Rochester</a> his cross-bearer. Even the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="15733b.htm">York</a> was not exempt from his <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and these <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> also extended to <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (see Wharton, "Anglia Sacra", for instances) and to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Normandy, Gascony, and Aquitaine, as long as these provinces formed part of the English dominions. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> enjoyed perpetual legatine power, being <em>Apostolicae Sedis legatus natus</em>, and in councils abroad he took precedence of other <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, having the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to a special place "at the Pope's right foot". In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> he was the <a href="11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the royal court, wherever held, and the king and queen were regarded as his parishioners. He had the right of crowning and anointing the sovereign, a privilege confirmed by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. He was the first peer of the realm, with precedence over all dukes not of the blood royal. He had the right of confirming the election of all suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and of consecrating them, and in the case of Rochester he enjoyed the patronage of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>, having the <a href="11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to the temporalities during all vacancies. He also possessed many <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, <a href="11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, Lincoln, <a href="03657a.htm">Chichester</a>, and Rochester. There were over eighty such <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, all of which were exempt from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of their proper <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and subject to him. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> alone had the right of summoning a provincial synod.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>The diocese</h2>

<p>The diocese itself was not of great extent, consisting only of part of the County of Kent. There were 257 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and only one archdeaconry for the whole diocese. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> palace was at Canterbury on the west side of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> owned more than twenty manors in Kent alone, including the castle of Saltwood. The <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> residence, in later times, was at the Manor of Lambeth, while Otford was the most favoured country seat.</p>

<h2>The cathedral</h2>

<p>The <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> by <a href="02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> of an existing Roman basilica has been described in the words of the <a href="02384a.htm">Ven. Bede</a>. This building, with additions and alterations, continued until 1067, when, with the adjacent <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, it was destroyed by fire. In 1070 <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> began to rebuild it on a considerable scale, but no trace of his work remains visible. But the present <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> and western towers still rest on his foundations, and in fact the existing <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> covers as nearly as possible the same ground, with the addition of the retro-choir. Parts of the <a href="04558a.htm">crypt</a> and some of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> ruins also belong to his period. A new choir, afterwards known as the "glorious choir of Conrad", was begun in 1096, finished in 1130, and burnt in 1174, though two <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> and part of the <a href="04558a.htm">crypt</a> survive. The present choir, begun by <a href="15638b.htm">William of Sens</a> and continued by William the Englishman, was finished in 1184, and is the earliest specimen of Transitional architecture, as well as being the longest choir in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> (180 feet). In 1378 <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc's</a> <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> was pulled down, and the present <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> was begun by Prior Chillendon. At the same <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="03584a.htm">chapter house</a> and the <a href="04060a.htm">cloisters</a> were finished. Finally the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was completed, about 1495, by the erection of the great central tower 235 feet high. The total length of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is 522 feet, the breadth of the <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> and <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a> 71 feet. The building illustrates in itself almost all the varieties of Gothic, though Early English and Perpendicular predominate.</p>

<h2>History of the see</h2>

<p>Before <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> had acquired national unity, the foundation of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> had given it <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity. Older than any national institution, its history is inseparably bound up with that of the country, and the barest outline exceeds our space. The formation of the diocese was monastic, taking its rise from the Monastery of Christ Church, and the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization grew by means of the great <a href="04340c.htm">religious houses</a> at Dover, Lyminge, Folkestone, Minster in Sheppy, Minster in Thanet, Reculver, and the great rival <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Canterbury of Sts. Peter and Paul, afterwards St. Augustine's. Throughout the subsequent history the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> could not deal with <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> without the concurrence of the monastic chapter, and the efforts of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> to rid themselves of the control of the Canterbury <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> gave rise to the frequent disputes between <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> and chapter that recur throughout the history of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. From these foundations as centres the <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> system gradually spread. Another characteristic was the purely Roman character of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in Kent. It was free from all such conflicts with <a href="03493a.htm">Celtic Christianity</a> as took place in the North, and in liturgy it never developed a local use, but followed the <a href="13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> that <a href="02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> had introduced. The first five <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> were all Romans, <a href="04760b.htm">St. Deusdedit</a> being the first Englishman to rule the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. He was succeeded by St. Theodore, a Greek, one of the greatest of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, who travelled throughout <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and organized the <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> power and <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. He was followed by a line of monastic <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a>, chiefly local administrators. Under one of these, Jaernbehrt (766-790), during the supremacy of Mercia, the very primacy was threatened by the establishment of an Archbishopric of <a href="09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, but this did not last. After Alfred's time came several <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> translated from other sees, and bringing wider <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so that the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> grew in authority until it rose to its height during the episcopate of <a href="05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a>, whose genius marked an epoch in <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, as in national, history. Under him the influence of Canterbury was felt throughout the land. While relying chiefly on the work of the greater <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, he also encouraged the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, whose <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> settlements always followed the missionary work begun from the houses of the regulars. St. &AElig;lphege, <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the Danes in 1012, added the glory of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to the chair of Canterbury. The last of the Saxon <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> was Stigand, regarded as uncanonical because he had received his <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> from an <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, and he was finally dispossessed by <a href="15642c.htm">William the Conqueror</a> in 1070. Until this time there had been a sort of <a href="02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, or choriepiscopus, with the title "Bishop of St. Martin's", who held the church of that name at Canterbury, and whenever the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was absent filled his place. The last of these <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> was Godwin, who died in 1065. The new <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a>, refused to continue the arrangement. <a href="08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> introduced the <a href="12371a.htm">prebendal</a> system at Canterbury, and reorganized the arrangement of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, dividing off that of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from that of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, with the result that from that time the close bond that had previously existed between them disappeared. Thenceforth, too, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Canterbury became absorbed in the wider <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a>, as is seen in the episcopate of <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, who contested with the king the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> involved in the question of investitures.</p>

<p>The widened sphere of <a href="01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> activity was signalized when the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Theobald (1139-1161) as <em>legatus natus</em>. He was succeeded by <a href="14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a>, whose long struggle was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> by <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in 1170. Henceforth Canterbury, as the place of his shrine, entered on new glories, becoming famous through all <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> for the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought at the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a>, the devotion of the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and the splendour of the shrine. The next <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Richard, had to maintain the primacy of Canterbury against the claims of York, the question being finally compromised by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who gave York the title "Primate of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>" and Canterbury that of "<a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of All <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>". Succeeding <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> played prominent parts as statesmen, notably <a href="07508c.htm">Hubert Walter</a> and Stephen Langton, the latter taking the leading part in obtaining Magna Charta from King John. Endless disputes with the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and fruitless struggles against <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> exactions and royal abuses marked the short and unhappy episcopate of St. Edmund of Canterbury (1234-1240), the last of the <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. From his time to the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> were men distinguished in many ways, under whom the privileges and power of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> were constantly increased. The tradition was not reversed till the time of Cranmer, who, like his predecessors, received his <a href="11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, but considered that he held the <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> from the king. Having broken his own <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, he easily <a href="05054c.htm">divorced</a> the king from Queen Catherine. He allowed the shrine of St. Thomas to be <a href="04748c.htm">desecrated</a> and plundered in 1538, and in 1541 he ordered the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of all the <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> to be destroyed. Most of the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> he was forced to surrender to the king. In 1539 the two great <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Christ Church and St. Augustine's had been suppressed, and their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> seized. By his office Cranmer was the head of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, but under Henry he helped to despoil it, and under Edward he led the reforming party against it, abolishing the Mass, and stripping the churches. The spiritual and material ruin thus accomplished could not be effectually remedied during the brief episcopate of <a href="12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a> (1556-1558). This <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> did all that was possible in so short a time, but his death, which took place on the 17th of November, 1558, brought to a close the line of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. With the accession of Elizabeth&mdash;which took place on the same day&mdash;the new state of things, which has continued to the present time, was begun. Canterbury, as a city, has never recovered from the loss of <a href="14676a.htm">St. Thomas's</a> shrine and the destruction of the two great <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> still remains, one of the finest buildings in the country, as a <a href="15677a.htm">witness</a> to its former glory.</p>
