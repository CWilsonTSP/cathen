<p>(Lotario de' Conti)</p>

<p>One of the greatest <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, son of Count Trasimund of <a href="13683b.htm">Segni</a> and nephew of <a href="04018a.htm">Clement III</a>, born 1160 or 1161 at <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, and died 16 June, 1216, at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>.</p>

<p>He received his early <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, studied <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at Bologna, and became a learned <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> and one of the greatest jurists of his time. Shortly after the death of <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (30 Aug., 1181) Lotario returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and held various <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices during the short reigns of Lucius III, <a href="15211a.htm">Urban III</a>, <a href="06795a.htm">Gregory VIII</a>, and <a href="04018a.htm">Clement III</a>. <a href="06795a.htm">Pope Gregory VIII</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> him <a href="14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and <a href="04018a.htm">Clement III</a> created him <a href="03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of St. George in Velabro and Sts. Sergius and Bacchus, in 1190. Later he became <a href="03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of St. Pudentiana. During the pontificate of <a href="03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> (1191-1198), a member of the House of the Orsini, enemies of the counts of <a href="13683b.htm">Segni</a>, he lived in retirement, probably at <a href="01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, devoting himself chiefly to meditation and literary pursuits. <a href="03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> died 8 January, 1198. Previous to his death he had urged the <a href="03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> to elect Giovanni di Colonna as his successor; but Lotario de' Conti was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on the very day on which <a href="03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> died. He accepted the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a> with reluctance and took the name of Innocent III. At the time of his accession to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> he was only thirty-seven years of age. The imperial throne had become <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a> by the death of <a href="07233a.htm">Henry VI</a> in 1197, and no successor had as yet been elected. The tactful and energetic <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> made good use of the opportunity offered him by this vacancy for the restoration of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> power in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. The Prefect of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who reigned over the city as the emperor's representative, and the senator who stood for the communal <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="11176a.htm">swore</a> allegiance to Innocent. When he had thus re-established the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he availed himself of every opportunity to put in practice his grand concept of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> was tired of being ruled by a host of German adventurers, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> experienced little difficulty in extending his political power over the peninsula. First he sent two <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> to Markwuld to demand the restoration of the Romagna and the <a href="01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Upon his evasive answer he was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> and driven away by the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> troops. In like manner the Duchy of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and the Districts of <a href="01801a.htm">Assisi</a> and Sora were wrested from the German <a href="03691a.htm">knight</a>, Conrad von Uerslingen. The league which had been formed among the cities of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> was ratified by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> after it acknowledged him as suzerain.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The death of the Emperor Henry VI left his four-year old child, <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, King of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The emperor's <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> Constance, who ruled over <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> for her little son, was unable to cope singly against the Norman barons of the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> Kingdom, who resented the German rule and refused to acknowledge the child-king. She appealed to Innocent III to save the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> throne for her child. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> made use of this opportunity to reassert <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> suzerainty over <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and acknowledged <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> as king only after Constance had surrendered certain privileges contained in the so-called Four Chapters, which William I had previously extorted from <a href="01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> then solemnly invested <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> as King of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> in a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> issued about the middle of November, 1198. Before the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> reached <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> Constance had died, but before her death she had appointed Innocent as guardian of the orphan-king. With the greatest fidelity the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> watched over the welfare of his ward during the nine years of his minority. Even the enemies of the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> admit that Innocent was an unselfish guardian of the young king and that no one else could have ruled for him more ably and conscientiously. To protect the inexperienced king against his enemies, he induced him in 1209 to marry Constance, the <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of King Emeric of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>.</p>

<p>Conditions in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> were extremely favourable for the application of Innocent's <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> concerning the relation between the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire. After the death of Henry VI a double election had ensued. The <a href="07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a> had elected Philip of Swabia on 6 March, 1198, while the <a href="07056c.htm">Guelfs</a> had elected <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a>, son of Henry the Lion and nephew of <a href="13041b.htm">King Richard of England</a>, in April of the same year. The former was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> on 8 September, 1198, the latter at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a> on 12 July, 1198. Immediately upon his accession to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne Innocent had sent the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sutri and the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Sant' Anastasio as <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, with instructions to free Philip of Swabia from the ban which he had incurred under <a href="03478b.htm">Celestine III</a>, on condition that he would bring about the liberation of the <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Queen Sibyl of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and restore the territory which he had taken from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> when he was Duke of <a href="15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. When the <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> arrived in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Philip had already been elected king. Yielding to the wishes of Philip, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sutri secretly freed him from the ban upon his mere promise to fulfil the proposed conditions. After the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> Philip sent the <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> back to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> with letters requesting the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> ratification of his election; but Innocent was dissatisfied with the action of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sutri and refused to ratify the election. <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> also sent <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a> to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> after his <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, but before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> took any action, the two claimants of the German throne began to assert their claims by force of arms. Though the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> did not openly side with either of them, it was apparent that his sympathy was with <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a>. Offended at what they considered an <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> interference on the part of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, the adherents of Philip sent a letter to him in which they protested against his interference in the imperial affairs of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In his answer Innocent stated that he had no intention of encroaching upon the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the princes, but insisted upon the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in this matter. He emphasized especially that the conferring of the imperial crown belonged to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> alone. In 1201 the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> openly espoused the side of <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a>. On 3 July, 1201, the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Cardinal-Bishop Guido of <a href="11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, announced to the people, in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cologne, that <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> had been approved by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as Roman king and threatened with <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> all those who refused to acknowledge him. Innocent III made clear to the German princes by the <a href="04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Venerabilem" which he addressed to the Duke of Z&auml;hringen in May, 1202, in what relation he considered the empire to stand to the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. This <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a>, which has become famous, was afterwards embodied in the "Corpus Juris Canonici". It is found in <a href="02242a.htm">Baluze</a>, "Registrum Innocentii III super negotio Romani Imperii", no. lxii, and is reprinted in P.L., CCXVI, 1065-7. The following are the chief points of the <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a>:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>The German princes have the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to elect the king, who is afterwards to become emperor.</li><li>This right was given them by the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> when it transferred the imperial dignity from the Greeks to the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>.</li><li>The right to investigate and decide whether a king thus elected is worthy of the imperial dignity belongs to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose office it is to anoint, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, and crown him; otherwise it might happen that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> would be <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to anoint, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrate</a>, and Crown a king who was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>, or a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a>.</li><li>If the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> finds that the king who has been elected by the princes is unworthy of the imperial dignity, the princes must elect a new king or, if they refuse, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> will confer the imperial dignity upon another king; for the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> stands in need of a patron and defender.</li><li>In case of a double election the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> must exhort the princes to come to an agreement. If after a due interval they have not reached an agreement they must ask the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to arbitrate, failing which, he must of his own accord and by virtue of his office decide in favour of one of the claimants. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> decision need not be based on the greater or less legality of either election, but on the qualifications of the claimants.</li></ul></div>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Innocent's exposition of his theory concerning the relation between the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> and the empire was accepted by many princes, as is apparent from the sudden increase of Otto's adherents subsequent to the issue of the <a href="04670b.htm">decretal</a>. If after 1203 the majority of the princes began again to side with Philip, it was the fault of Otto himself, who was very irritable and often offended his best friends. Innocent, reversing his decision, declared in favour of Philip in 1207, and sent the <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> <a href="06796a.htm">Ugolino</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a> and Leo of Santa Croce to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> with instructions to endeavour to induce Otto to renounce his claims to the throne and with powers to free Philip from the ban. The <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> of King Philip by Otto of Wittelsbach, 21 June, 1208, entirely changed conditions in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. At the Diet of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 11 November, 1208, Otto was acknowledged as king by all the princes, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> invited him to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to receive the imperial crown. He was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor in the <a href="13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 4 October, 1209. Before his <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> he had solemnly promised to leave the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in the peaceful possession of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and the gift of Countess Matilda; to assist the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the exercise of his suzerainty over <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; to grant freedom of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> elections; unlimited right of appeal to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and the exclusive competency of the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in spiritual matters; he had, moreover renounced the "regalia" and the <em>jus spolii</em>, i.e., the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to the revenues of vacant sees and the seizure of the estates of intestate <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. He also promised to assist the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the extirpation of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. But scarcely had he been <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor when he seized <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, the bequest of Matilda, and other <a href="12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, giving it in vassalage to some of his friends. He also united with the enemies of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> and invaded the <a href="13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a> with the purpose of wresting it from the youthful king and from the suzerainty of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. When Otto did not listen to the remonstrances of Innocent, the latter <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, 18 November, 1210, and solemnly proclaimed his <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> at a Roman <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> held on 31 March, 1211. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> now began to treat with <a href="12001a.htm">King Philip Augustus of France</a> and with the German princes, with the result that most princes renounced the <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> emperor and elected in his place the youthful <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, at the Diet of <a href="11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> in September, 1211. The election was repeated in presence of a representative of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and of <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus of France</a> at the Diet of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 2 December, 1212. After making practically the same promises to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> which <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> had made previously, and, in addition, taking the solemn <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> never to unite <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> with the empire, his election was ratified by Innocent and he was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a> on 12 July, 1215. The deposed emperor <a href="11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> hastened to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> immediately upon the election of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, but received little support from the princes. In alliance with John of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> he made <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> upon Philip of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, but was defeated in the battle of Bouvines, 27 July, 1214. Then he lost all influence in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and died on 19 May, 1218, leaving the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> creature, <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, the undisputed emperor. When Innocent ascended the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne a cruel <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> was being waged between <a href="02107a.htm">Philip Augustus of France</a> and Richard of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> considered it his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, as the supreme ruler of the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>, to put an end to all hostilities among <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes. Shortly after his accession he sent Cardinal Peter of <a href="03319a.htm">Capua</a> to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> with instructions to threaten both kings with <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> if they would not within two months conclude peace or at least agree upon a truce of five years. In January, 1198, the two kings met between Vernon and Andely and a truce of five years was agreed upon. The same <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> was instructed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to threaten <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> with <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> over the whole of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> if within a month he would not be reconciled with his lawful wife, Ingeburga of <a href="04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, whom he had rejected and in whose stead he had taken Agnes, daughter of the Duke of Meran. When Philip took no heed of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> warning Innocent carried out his threat and on 12 December, 1199, laid the whole of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> under <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a>. For nine months the king remained stubborn, but when the barons and the people began to rise in rebellion against him he finally discarded his <a href="04207a.htm">concubine</a> and the <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> was lifted on 7 September, 1200. It was not, however, until 1213 that the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> succeeded in bringing about a final reconciliation between the king and his lawful wife Ingeburga.</p>

<p>Innocent also had an opportunity to assert the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. After the death of Archbishop Hubert of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, in 1205, a number of the younger <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Christ Church assembled secretly at night and elected their sub-prior, Reginald, as <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. This election was made without the concurrence of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and without the authority of the king. Reginald was asked not to divulge his election until he had received the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="01656b.htm">approbation</a>. But on his way to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> the vain <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> assumed the title of archbishop-elect, and thus the episcopal body of the province of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> was apprised of the secret election. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> at once sent Peter of Anglesham as their representative to Pope Innocent to protest against the uncanonical proceedings of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Christ Church. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> also were highly incensed at Reginald because, contrary to his promise, he had divulged his election. They proceeded to a second election, and on 11 December, 1205, cast their votes for the royal favourite, John de Grey, whom the king had recommended to their suffrages. The controversy between the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Christ Church and the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> concerning the right of electing the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, Innocent decided in favour of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, but in the present case he pronounced both elections invalid; that of Reginald because it had been made uncanonically and <a href="04001a.htm">clandestinely</a>, that of John de Grey because it had occurred before the invalidity of the former was proclaimed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Not even King John, who offered Innocent 3000 marks if he would decide in favour of de Grey, could alter the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> decision. Innocent summoned those <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> who were in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to proceed to a new election and recommended to their choice Stephen Langton, an Englishman, whom the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had called to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the rectorship of the <a href="11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, in order to create him <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. He was duly elected by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> himself <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> at <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> on 17 June, 1207. Innocent informed King John of the election of Langton and asked him to accept the new <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The king, however, had set his mind on his favourite, John de Grey, and flatly refused to allow Langton to come to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in the capacity of <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. He, moreover, wreaked his vengeance on the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Christ Church by driving them from their <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and taking possession of their <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>. Innocent now placed the entire kingdom under <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> which was proclaimed on 24 March, 1208. When this <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> of no avail and the king committed acts of cruelty against the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> declared him <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in 1209, and formally deposed him in 1212. He entrusted King Philip of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> with the execution of the sentence. When Philip threatened to invade <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords and the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> began to forsake King John, the latter made his submission to <a href="11441a.htm">Pandulph</a>, whom Innocent had sent as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. He promised to acknowledge Langton as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, to allow the exiled <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to return to <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and to make compensation for the losses which the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> had sustained. He went still further, and on 13 May, 1213, probably of his own initiative, surrendered the English kingdom through <a href="11441a.htm">Pandulph</a> into the hands of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to be returned to him as a fief. The document of the surrender states that henceforth the kings of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> were to rule as vassals of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and to pay an annual tribute of 1000 marks to the <a href="07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>. On 20 July, 1213, the king was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> freed from the ban at <a href="15649c.htm">Winchester</a> and after the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> had been reimbursed for its losses the <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> was lifted from <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> on 29 June, 1214. It appears that many of the barons were not pleased with the surrender of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> into the hands of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. They also resented the king's continuous trespasses upon their liberties and his many acts of <a href="08010c.htm">injustice</a> in the government of the people. They finally had recourse to <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> and forced him to yield to their demands by affixing his seal to the Magna Charta. Innocent could not as suzerain of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> allow a contract which imposed such serious <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a> upon his vassal to be made without his consent. His <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> <a href="11441a.htm">Pandulph</a> had repeatedly praised King John to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> as a wise ruler and loyal vassal of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, therefore, declared the Great Charter null and void, not because it gave too many liberties to the barons and the people, but because it had been obtained by <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a>.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a country in <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> over which Innocent III did not in some way or other assert the supremacy which he claimed for the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. He <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Alfonso IX of <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a>, for marrying a near relative, Berengaria, a daughter of Alfonso VIII, contrary to the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and effected their separation in 1204. For similar reasons he annulled, in 1208, the marriage of the crown-prince, Alfonso of <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, with Urraca, daughter of Alfonso of Castile. From Pedro II of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> he received that kingdom in vassalage and <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> him king at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1204. He prepared a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> and lived to see their power broken in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> at the battle of Navas de Tolosa, in 1212. He protected the people of <a href="11117b.htm">Norway</a> against their tyrannical king, Sverri, and after the king's death arbitrated between the two claimants to the <a href="11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> throne. He mediated between King Emeric of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and his rebellious brother Andrew, sent royal crown and sceptre to King Johannitius of <a href="03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> and had his <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> crown him king at Tirnovo, in 1204; he restored <a href="05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> in <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>; arbitrated between the two claimants to the royal crown of <a href="14347a.htm">Sweden</a>; made partly successful attempts to reunite the Greek with the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> and extended his beneficent influence practically over the whole <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. Like many preceding <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, Innocent had at heart the recovery of the Holy Land, and for this end undertook the <a href="04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a>. The <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> had pledged themselves to transport the entire <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> army and to furnish the fleet with provisions for nine months, for 85,000 marks. When the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> were unable to pay the sum, the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> proposed to bear the financial expenses themselves on condition that the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> would first assist them in the conquest of the city of <a href="15752a.htm">Zara</a>. The <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> yielded to their demands and the fleet started down the Adriatic on 8 October, 1202. <a href="15752a.htm">Zara</a> had scarcely been reduced when Alexius Comnenus arrived at the camp of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> and pleaded for their help to replace his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, Isaac Angelus, on the throne of Constantinople from which he had been deposed by his cruel brother Alexius. In return he promised to reunite the Greek with the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, to add 10,000 soldiers to the ranks of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, and to contribute money and provisions to the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a>. The <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, who saw their own commercial advantage in the taking of Constantinople, induced the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> to yield to the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Alexius, and Constantinople was taken by them in 1204. Isaac Angelus was restored to his throne but soon replaced by a usurper. The <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> took Constantinople a second time on 12 April, 1204, and after a horrible pillage, Baldwin, Count of <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, was proclaimed emperor and the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> was united with the Latin. The reunion, as well as the Latin empire in the East, did not last longer than two generations. When Pope Innocent learned that the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> had diverted the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> from their purpose of conquering the Holy Land he expressed his great dissatisfaction first at their conquest of <a href="15752a.htm">Zara</a>, and when they proceeded towards Constantinople he solemnly protested and finally <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> who had caused the digression of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusaders</a> from their original purpose. Since, however, he could not undo what had been accomplished he did his utmost to destroy the <a href="13535a.htm">Greek schism</a> and latinize the Eastern Empire.</p>

<p>Innocent was also a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> protector of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> Faith and a strenuous opponent of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a>. His chief activity was turned against the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> who had become so numerous and aggressive that they were no longer satisfied with being adherents of <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines but even endeavoured to spread their <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> by force. They were especially numerous in a few cities of Northern and in Southern <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. During the first year of his pontificate Innocent sent the two <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> Rainer and Guido to the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to preach to them the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> Faith and dispute with them on controverted topics of religion. The two <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> missionaries were soon followed by Diego, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11339a.htm">Osma</a>, then by <a href="05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> and the two <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a>. <a href="12079d.htm">Peter of Castelnau</a> and Raoul. When, however, these peaceful missionaries were ridiculed and despised by the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, and the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a> <a href="12079d.htm">Castelnau</a> was assassinated in 1208, Innocent resorted to force. He ordered the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Southern <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to put under <a href="08073a.htm">interdict</a> the participants in the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a> and all the towns that gave shelter to them. He was especially incensed against Count Raymond of <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> who had previously been <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> and whom, for good reasons, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> suspected as the instigator of the <a href="07441a.htm">murder</a>. The count protested his innocence and submitted to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, probably out of cowardice, but the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> placed no further trust in him. He called upon <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> to raise an army for the suppression of the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. Under the leadership of Simon of Montfort a cruel campaign ensued against the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> which, despite the protest of Innocent, soon turned into a <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of conquest (see <a href="01267e.htm">ALBIGENSES</a>). The culminating point in the glorious reign of Innocent was his convocation of the <a href="09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a>, which he solemnly opened on 15 November, 1215. It was by far the most important council of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Besides deciding on a general <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> to the Holy Land, it issued seventy reformatory decrees, the first of which was a creed (<em>Firmiter credimus</em>), against the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> and <a href="15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, in which the term "transubstantiation" received its first <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sanction.</p>

<p>The labours of Innocent in the inner government of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> appear to be of a very subordinate character when they are put beside his great politico-ecclesiastical achievements which brought the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> to the zenith of its power. Still they are worthy of memory and have contributed their share to the glory of his pontificate. During his reign the two great founders of the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, St. Dominic and St. Francis, laid before him their scheme of reforming the world. Innocent was not blind to the vices of luxury and indolence which had infected many of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and part of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>. In Dominic and Francis he recognized two mighty adversaries of these vices and he sanctioned their projects with words of encouragement. The lesser <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders which he approved are the <a href="07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of the Holy Ghost on 23 April, 1198, the Trinitarians on 17 December, 1198, and the <a href="07543a.htm">Humiliati</a>, in June, 1201. In 1209 he commissioned the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, Christian, afterwards <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, with the conversion of the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="12519c.htm">Prussians</a>. At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> he built the famous <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> Santo Spirito in Sassia, which became the model of all future city <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and exists to the present time (see Walsh, "The Popes and Science", New York, 1908, p. 249-258; and the article <a href="07480a.htm">HOSPITALS</a>). The following <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> were <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Innocent: Homobonus, a merchant of <a href="04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, on 12 January, 1199; the Empress Cunegond, on 3 March, 1200; William, Duke of Aquitaine in 1202; Wulstan, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15733b.htm">York</a>, on 14 May, 1203; Procopius, <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> at <a href="12338a.htm">Prague</a>, on 2 June, 1204; and Guibert, the founder of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="06407c.htm">Gembloux</a>, in 1211. Innocent died at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, while travelling through <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the interests of the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> which had been decided upon at the Lateran Council. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a> where his body remained until <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, a great admirer of Innocent, had it transferred to the Lateran in December, 1891. Innocent is also the author of various literary works reprinted in P.L., CCXIV-CCXVIII, where may also be found his numerous extant epistles and <a href="04670b.htm">decretals</a>, and the historically important "Registrum Innocentii III super negotio imperii". His first work, "De contemptu mundi, sive de miseria conditionis human&aelig; libri III" (P.L., CCXVII, 701-746) was written while he lived in retirement during the pontificate of <a href="03478b.htm">Celestine III</a>. It is an <a href="14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatise and gives evidence of Innocent's deep <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of men. Concerning it see Reinlein "Papst Innocenz der dritte und seine Schrift 'De contemptu mundi" (Erlangen, 1871). His treatise "De sacro altaris mysterio libri VI" (P.L., CCXVII, 773-916) is of great <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> value, because it represents the Roman Mass as it was at the time of Innocent. See Franz, "Die Messe im deutschen Mittelalter" (Freiburg, 1902), 453-457. It was printed repeatedly, and translated into German by <a href="07583c.htm">Hurter</a> (Schaffhausen, 1845). He also wrote "De quadripartita specie nuptiarum" (P.L., CCXVII, 923-968), an exposition of the fourfold marriage bond, namely,</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ol><li>between man and wife,</li><li>between <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>,</li><li>between <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the just <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>,</li><li>between the Word and <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="10715a.htm">nature</a></li></ol></div>

<p>and is entirely based on passages from <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a>.</p>

<p>"Commentarius in septem psalmos p&oelig;nitentiales" (P.L., CCXVII, 967-1130) is of <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authorship. Among his seventy-nine sermons (ibidem, 314-691) is the famous one on the text "Desiderio desideravi" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs15">Luke 22:15</a>), which he delivered at the <a href="09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a>.</p>
