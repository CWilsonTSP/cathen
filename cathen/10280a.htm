<p>The State of Michigan is bounded on the north by Lake Superior, on the east by <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair, on the south by Ohio and Indiana, and on the west by Lake Michigan and the State of Wisconsin. It has an area of 58,915 square miles.</p>

<h2>Geography</h2>

<p>Michigan consists of two distinct parts separated by the Strait of Mackinac and known respectively as the Lower and Upper Peninsula. The Lower Peninsula, the most important part, consists of agricultural lands including the "Fruit Belt" about thirty miles wide, extending along the shore of Lake Michigan, in which all fruits of the northern states flourish and all the general farming crops of the northern states are grown. Some large tracts, formerly covered with pine, are sandy and of small value, but the greater part of the land is fertile. There are salt works and gypsum mines and some coal fields in this section, as well as brick-clay. The Upper Peninsula is mountainous and rocky, interspersed with level tracts of good soil. It is rich in iron and copper, furnishing seventy per cent of all the iron produced in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> and fourteen per cent of the copper of the world. There are still large tracts of virgin forest, and the land suitable for agriculture has not yet been fully settled.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The population as shown by the last State census taken in 1904 was 2,530,016, of which 2,253,938 were in the Lower Peninsula. It is estimated that the population has increased at least 20 percent since that time.</p>

<h3>Agriculture</h3>

<p>The agricultural produce for the year 1908 is estimated at 60,420,000 bushels of corn, 15,732,000 bushels of wheat, 41,847,000 bushels of oats, besides large quantities of beans, sugar-beets, potatoes, and other crops. The value of its wool was $2,732,000. It had 2,130,000 sheep, 704,000 horses, 2,451,000 neat cattle, and 1,388,000 swine.</p>

<h3>Mining</h3>

<p>The value of the output of the mines is estimated at $106,514,000 for the year 1907.</p>

<h3>Manufactures</h3>

<p>The value of the manufactures for the last statistical year, 1905, is estimated at $429,039,778, consisting of iron works, furniture, and other woodworks, salt works, automobiles, and manufactures of many other descriptions.</p>

<h3>Fisheries</h3>

<p>Michigan has the largest fresh water fisheries in the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> the catch for the year amounting to $686,375 in the Great Lakes in the last statistical year 1903.</p>

<h3>Commerce</h3>

<p>Is carried on by water as well as by railroad, and its volume is very extensive.</p>

<h3>Means of communication</h3>

<p>Steam vessels and vessels of all kinds navigate the Great Lakes, except during two or three of the winter months. There are 8723 miles of steam railroads and 930 miles of electric roads exclusive of city street railroads.</p>

<h2>Educational system</h2>

<h3>University of Michigan</h3>

<p>Founded at <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a> (1817) with Rev. John Monteith and Father Richard as its entire faculty. Its present organization and location at Ann Arbor, date from 1837. It has a collegiate staff of 409 professors, instructors, assistants and administrative officers and (1908) had 5,188 enrolled students. Besides the classical course it has <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of medicine and law. Students of both sexes are admitted and residents of Michigan have tuition free. It is supported by three-eighths of a mill tax on all <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> in the state an interest on original endowment fund and students' fees and appropriations by legislature, and is governed by a board of eight regents, two being elected every second year who hold office eight years. State Agricultural College, founded in 1855, located at Lansing, besides scientific and practical agriculture has technological classes. It has 90 instructors, had 1191 students in 1908, and is supported by interest on endowment fund, one-tenth of a mill tax and appropriations from U.S. Treasury and by state Legislature, students' fees, and receipts from produce. College of Mines, opened in 1886, located at Houghton in the Upper Peninsula in the midst of copper mines, has 32 instructors, had 266 students in 1908, and is supported by legislative appropriations and students' fee.</p>

<h3>Normal schools</h3>

<p>There are four in the state, located at Ypsilanti, Mount Pleasant, <a href="09689a.htm">Marquette</a>, and Kalamazoo. They employ in all 170 instructors, have an average attendance of 6,281 pupils, and are supported by legislative appropriations and student' fees.</p>

<h3>Special schools</h3>

<p>A <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for the deaf, established in 1854, located at Flint, has 48 instructors, an average attendance of 320 pupils, and is supported by legislative appropriations. A <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for the blind was established (1881) at Lansing, and has 15 instructors, an average of 131 pupils, and is supported by legislative appropriations. The Employment Institute for the Blind, established 1903, located at Saginaw, has 7 instructors and 102 pupils, and is also supported by legislative appropriation. The State Public School for Destitute and Ill-treated Children was opened in 1874 at Coldwater. Instruction is given in manual labour and primary <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> grades. It has 5 teachers, 8 cottage managers, average of inmates 526, average age of children 6.9 years. Supported by legislative appropriation.</p>

<h3>Public school system</h3>

<p>Each township and city is divided into <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> districts of convenient size, each which has its <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> house and teacher or teachers. In cities, villages and such townships as so determine by vote, graded and high schools are maintained as well as the primary <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and all are supported by taxation of the <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> in each <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> district. There are 17,286 teachers in the public <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and 743,630 pupils, the total appropriation from all sources was $19,202,449.61 in the last fiscal year. This does not include the private or denominational <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. All children between the ages of seven and fifteen years are compelled by law to attend some <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, either public, <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a>, or private at least four months in each year, unless shown to be properly taught at home.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>The first settles of Michigan (about 1641) were the hardy and adventurous <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03227a.htm">Canadians</a> who established trading posts at Sault Ste. Marie and Michillimackinac (now "Mackinac"), which they reached by way of the Ottawa River, thence by portage to Lake Nipissing and so by Georgian Bay to their destination. This route was evidently selected through fear of the <a href="08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, usually hostile to <a href="03227a.htm">Canada</a>, on the shores of Lakes Erie and <a href="11254a.htm">Ontario</a>. These pioneers were soon followed and aided by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> <a href="01326b.htm">Allouez</a>, <a href="09689a.htm">Marquette</a>, and others. Detroit was first settled by Antoine* De La Motte Cadillac (1701) and the <a href="06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="03227a.htm">Canadians</a> who followed him formed the earliest farming population, settling on the shores of Detroit River. Until the country fell into the hands of the British (1760) there were no settlers of any other nationality, and during the British occupation and afterward, until after the close of the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of 1812, there were but few. Indian troubles and the unsettled stated caused by <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> were so prejudicial to immigration that when Michigan was organized as a territory (1805) its population did not exceed 4,000 <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. But when the public lands were offered for sale (1818) a tide of settlers at once set in from New England, New York, <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, and other states, besides emigrants from <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="05445a.htm">Great Britain</a>, and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Later there was also large emigration from <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and later still from <a href="12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and in short from every <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> nation, as well as some from <a href="15097a.htm">Turkey</a>, <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, and <a href="03663b.htm">China</a>. Michigan was admitted as the twenty-sixth state of the Union, 26 January, 1837. It adopted a constitution on being admitted as a state. In 1850 a second constitution materially changing the former one was framed and adopted, and (1909) a third constitution, better suited to the needs of the state, was prepared, adopted by popular vote, and went into effect January, 1910. Formal possession of the entire region was taken in the name of the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> at Sault Ste. Marie (1672). In 1701 Antoine* De La Motte Cadillac founded Detroit, naming it Fort Pontchartrain. In 1760 Michigan came under British rule. In 1796 the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a> took possession, and Michigan became a part of the Northwest Territory. Michigan (without the Upper Peninsula) became an organized territory in 1805. Father Gabriel Richard of <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a> was elected territorial <a href="04696b.htm">delegated</a> to Congress (1823), being the only <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> who ever had a seat in that assembly.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>There arose a dispute with <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a> as to the boundary line near Toledo. Michigan adopted a constitution and took all <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> steps for admission into the Union, but was prevented from doing so by reason of the Ohio dispute, which was settled by the boundary line being determined in favour of <a href="11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, and by Michigan obtaining instead the Upper Peninsula. It was then allowed to enter the Union (1837). The capital was removed from <a href="04758b.htm">Detroit</a> to Lansing (1847), then a small village in a dense forest, now a city of 24,000 inhabitants. A colony of <a href="10570c.htm">Mormons</a> took possession of Beaver Island in Lake Michigan, from which they were forcibly expelled by armed fishermen from the mainland in 1856.</p>

<p>The Republican party was organized "under the oaks" at Jackson, Michigan. Up to that time the Democratic party had been in power in the state, but ever since the Republicans have had a large majority of the voters. This state sent 93,700 men to the Civil War, of who 14,855 died in the service.</p>

<p>Michigan furnished five regiments, of 1026 officers and men each, for the Spanish War (1898), of which three regiments went to Cuba.</p>

<h2>Laws and religion</h2>

<p>The constitution provides that "Every <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> shall be at liberty to worship <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> according to the dictates of his own <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>. No <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> shall be compelled to attend, or against his consent, to contribute to the erection or support of any place of religious worship, or to pay <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>, taxes, or other rates for the support of any minister of the gospel or teachers of religion. No money shall be appropriated or drawn from the treasury for the benefit of any <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> or <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> or religious <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>; nor shall <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> belonging to the state be appropriated for any such purpose. The <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> and political <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, privileges and capacities of no <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> shall be diminished or enlarged on account of his religious <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>." The <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> prohibit under penalty of a fine of $10 the keeping open of any workshop or place of business; the transaction of any business; all work and labour, attendance at dance, public diversion; show or entertainment; taking part in any sport, game, or play, on Sunday: works of necessity and charity are excepted. All <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> are also prohibited from attending any public assembly, except for religious services or concerts of <a href="10648a.htm">sacred music</a>. The sale of intoxicating liquors on Sunday is made a misdemeanour, punishable by fine and <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. Oaths are administered by the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who swears holding up his right hand, except in cases where the affiant has any particular mode which he considers more binding. The form in general use is "You do solemnly swear that ... So help you <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>." Blasphemy and profanity are punished by fine and <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. There are now <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning the use of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the Legislature. The custom is that at the first session of each house some minister of the Gospel is invited to offer <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a> and New Year's Day are recognized as holidays, but business and work are not prohibited on those days, which are on a par with Independence Day, etc.</p>

<h3>Seal of confession</h3>

<p>"No minister of the Gospel or <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of any denomination whatsoever shall be allowed to disclose any confessions made to him in his professional character, in the course of discipline enjoined by the rules or practice of such denomination." And all <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Gospel are exempt from serving on juries, and from military <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>.</p>

<h3>Church property</h3>

<p>Any five adult <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> may become incorporated as a religious <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> by executing and acknowledging Articles of Association in triplicate, stating the name and purpose of the corporation, the names and residence of the original incorporators, and the period for which it is incorporated. One of the triplicates must be filed with the Secretary of State, and one with the County Registrar of Deeds. Such corporation may make its own by-laws, which must be recorded by the Registrar of Deeds, and is entitled to receive and hold real and personal <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> by purchase, gift, or bequest and may sue or be sued. There is no restriction as to number or nomenclature of officers. Religious bodies such as <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, conferences, and the like may obtain corporate powers to hold <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, sue and be sued, etc., by elected not less than three or more than nine trustees and filing certificates of such election and the corporate name by which there are to be known with the Secretary of State and County Clerk.

L'Anse, and elsewhere. There are few <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Indians left in the <a href="04758b.htm">Diocese of Detroit</a>.
