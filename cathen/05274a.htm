<h1>Meister Johann Eckhart</h1>

<p>(<em>Also spelled</em> Eckard, Eccard. Meister means "the Master").</p>

<p><a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> preacher, <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> and mystic, born about 1260 at Hochheim, near Gotha; died in 1327 at Cologne. He made his <a href="12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>. Although a profound mystic he was also an able man of affairs, admirably manifesting the spirit of his order by uniting throughout his career great activity with contemplation. After a period of teaching he was made, in 1298, <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at Erfurt and vicar-provincial of <a href="14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>. Two years later he began to lecture at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where in 1302 his order gave him the degree of Master of Sacred Theology. In the following year he was elected <a href="12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the province of Saxony, to which office he was re-elected in 1307, when he was also appointed <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of <a href="02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and charged to reform its <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>. His term of office having expired in 1311, he again took a professorial chair at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, whence he went in 1314 to teach at Strasbourg. After three years he was made prior at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>. He finally returned to the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in 1320, when he was made first professor of his order at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he remained until his death.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Eckhart's activity was also displayed in the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, of which he was an illustrious ornament, and in his writings in the form of treatises and sayings. As a preacher he disdained rhetorical flourish and avoided oratorical passion; but effectively employed the simple arts of oratory and gave remarkable expression to a hearty sympathy. Using pure language and a simple style, he has left us in his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> specimens of the beautiful German prose of which he was a master. In these sermons, really short catacheses, we find frequent citations from such writers as Seneca and <a href="02157a.htm">Avicenna</a>, as well as from the <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> and Fathers. His discourses are directed to the <a href="08066a.htm">intellect</a> rather than to the will and are remarkable for their depth of mystical teaching, which only those who were advanced in the spiritual life could fully appreciate. His favourite themes are the Divine essence, the relations between <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and man, the faculties, gifts, and operations of the human <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, the return of all created things to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. These and kindred subjects he develops more at length in his treatises, which partake of the <a href="05075b.htm">catechetical</a> character of his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>. In his sayings he presents them in short and pithy form. Although the writings of Eckhart do not present a connected and studied system, they reveal the mind of the <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, the <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and the mystic. The studies of Henry <a href="04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, O.P., while showing Eckhart to have been less of a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> than he was supposed to be, show also that he was a <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of very superior merit, although not of the first order. He followed the teaching of <a href="01264a.htm">St. Albert the Great</a> and of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, but departed from their <a href="13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> method and form. Some opponents of <a href="13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, admiring his aphorisms and originality of method, have pronounced him to be the greatest thinker before <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>. And there have been <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who called him a Reformer. It was, however, as a mystic that Eckhart excelled. He is held by many to have been the greatest of the German mystics, and by all to have been the father of German <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. To <a href="14465c.htm">Tauler</a> and <a href="07238c.htm">Suso</a> he gave not only <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> but also a clear, simple style, possessing a heartiness like that of his own. Although he frequently quotes from the writings of the Pseudo-Areopagite and of John Scotus Eriugena, in his <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a> he follows more closely the teaching of <a href="07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>.</p>

<p>The very nature of Eckhart's subjects and the untechnicality of his language were calculated to cause him to be misunderstood, not only by the ordinary hearers of his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>, but also by the <a href="13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> who listened to him or read his treatises. And it must be admitted that some of the sentences in his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a> and treatises were <a href="02389c.htm">Beghardic</a>, <a href="12608c.htm">quietistic</a>, or <a href="11447b.htm">pantheistic</a>. But although he occasionally allowed harmful sentences to proceed from his lips or his pen, he not unfrequently gave an antidote in the same sermons and treatises. And the general tenor of his teaching shows that he was not a <a href="02389c.htm">Beghard</a>, nor a <a href="12608c.htm">quietist</a>, nor a pantheist. While at Strasbourg, although he had no relations with <a href="02389c.htm">the Beghards</a>, he was suspected of holding their mystical <a href="11447b.htm">pantheism</a>. Later, at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> suspicion was cast upon his moral conduct, but it was evidently groundless; for, after an investigation ordered by the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> general, he was appointed to a prominent position at Cologne. Finally the charge was made at a general chapter of his order, held at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1325, that some of the German brethren were disseminating dangerous <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. <a href="11064b.htm">Father Nicholas, O.P.</a>, of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, having been ordered by <a href="08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> to make investigation, declared in the following year that the works of Eckhart were <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. In January, 1327, Archbishop Heinrich of Cologne undertook an independent inquiry, whereupon Eckhart and <a href="11064b.htm">Father Nicholas</a> appealed to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> against his action and authority in the matter. But the next month, from the <a href="12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church in <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Eckhart repudiated the unorthodox sense in which some of his utterances could be interpreted, retracted all possible <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a>, and submitted to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. His profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, repudiation of <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, and submission to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were declared by <a href="08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> in the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Dolentes referimus" (27 March, 1329), by which the pontiff condemned seventeen of Eckhart's propositions as <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and eleven as ill-sounding, rash, and suspected of <a href="07256b.htm">heresy</a> (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, no. 428 sqq.; Hartzheim, Conc. Germ., IV, 631).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The entire works of Eckhart have not been preserved. Pfeiffer in "Deutsche Mystiker des 14. Jahrhunderts" (1857), II, has given an incomplete version of his <a href="07448a.htm">sermons</a>. Additions have been made by Sievers in "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r deutsche Alterh&uuml;mer", XV, 373 sqq., Wackernagelin "Altdeutsche Predigten" (1876), 156 sqq., 172 sqq.; Berlinger in "Alemannia", III, 15 sqq.; Bech in "Germania", VIII, 223 sqq.; X, 391 sqq.; Jundt in "Histoire du Panth&eacute;isme" (1875), 231 sqq. There is a translation in High German by Landauer, "Meister Eckharts mystiche Schriften" (1903). Eckhart's Latin works bore the title "Opus Tripartitum". In the first part (Opus propositionum) there are over one thousand theses, which are explained in the second part (Opus qu&aelig;stionum), and <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> in the third part (Opus expositionum). Of these only the three prologues are <a href="08673a.htm">known</a>. <a href="04719a.htm">Denifle</a> discovered also a portion of the third part, part of an explanation of Genesis, a commentary on Exodus, Sirach, xxiv, Wisdom, and other fragments.</p>
