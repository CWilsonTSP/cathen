<p>According to the testimony of <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> ("First Apolog.", xxvi), whose statement as to this should probably be believed, Simon came from Gitta (in the Pseudo-Clementine Homilies, II, xxii, called (<em>Getthon</em>) in the country of the <a href="13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>. At the outbreak of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> (c. 37 A.D.) of the early <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> community at <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> that began with the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Stephen, when Philip the Deacon went from <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to <a href="13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, Simon lived in the latter city. By his magic arts, because of which he was called "Magus", and by his teachings in which he announced himself as the "great power of God", he had made a name for himself and had won adherents. He listened to Philip's sermons, was impressed by them, and like many of his countrymen was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> and united with the community of believers in Christ. But, as was evident later, his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> was not the result of the inner conviction of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the Redeemer, but rather from selfish motives, for he hoped to gain greater magical power and thus to increase his influence. For when the Apostles Peter and John came to Samaria to bestow on the believers <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Philip the outpouring of the Spirit which was accompanied by <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> manifestations, Simon offered them money, desiring them to grant him what he regarded as magical power, so that he also by the <a href="07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> could bestow the Holy Ghost, and thereby produce such <a href="10338a.htm">miraculous</a> results. Full of indignation at such an offer Peter rebuked him sharply, exhorted him to penance and conversion and warned him of the wickedness of his conduct. Under the influence of Peter's rebuke Simon begged the Apostles to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a> for him (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs9">Acts 8:9-29</a>). However, according to the unanimous report of the authorities of the second century, he persisted in his <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> views. The <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers of the early Church universally represent him as the first <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a>, the "Father of Heresies".</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Simon is not mentioned again in the writings of the <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. The account in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> is the sole authoritative report that we have about him. The statements of the writers of the second century concerning him are largely legendary, and it is difficult or rather impossible to extract from them any historical fact the details of which are established with <a href="03539b.htm">certainty</a>. <a href="08580c.htm">St. Justin of Rome</a> ("First Apolog.", xxvi, lvi; "Dialogus c. Tryphonem", cxx) describes Simon as a man who, at the instigation of <a href="04710a.htm">demons</a>, claimed to be a god. <a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a> says further that Simon came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the reign of the Emperor Claudius and by his magic arts won many followers so that these erected on the island in the Tiber a <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> to him as a divinity with the inscription "Simon the Holy God". The <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a>, however, that <a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a> took for one dedicated to Simon was undoubtedly one of the old Sabine divinity Semo Sancus. Statues of this early god with similar inscriptions have been found on the island in the Tiber and elsewhere in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It is plain that the interchange of <em>e</em> and <em>i</em> in the Roman characters led <a href="08580c.htm">Justin or</a> the Roman <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> before him, to look upon the <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of the early Sabine deity, of whom they <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing, as a <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> of the magician. Whether <a href="08580c.htm">Justin's</a> opinion that Simon Magus came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> rests only on the fact that he believed Roman followers had erected this <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a> to him, or whether he had other information on this point, cannot now be positively determined. His testimony cannot, therefore, be verified and so remains <a href="05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. The later anti-heretical writers who report Simon's residence at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, take <a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a> and the <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of Peter as their authority, so that their testimony is of no value. Simon brought with him, so <a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a> and other authorities state, a paramour from <a href="15109a.htm">Tyre</a> called Helena. He claimed that she was the first conception (<em>ennoia</em>) whom he, as the "great power of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>", had freed from bondage.</p>

<p>Simon plays an important part in the "Pseudo-Clementines". He appears here as the chief antagonist of the apostle Peter, by whom he is everywhere followed and opposed. The alleged magical arts of the magician and Peter's efforts against him are described in a way that is absolutely imaginary. The entire account lacks all historical basis. In the "Philosophumena" of <a href="07360c.htm">Hippolytus of Rome</a> (vi, vii-xx), the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Simon and his followers is treated in detail. The work also relates circumstantially how Simon labored at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and won many by his magic arts, and how he attacked the Apostles Peter and Paul who opposed him. According to this account the reputation of the magician was greatly injured by the efforts of the two Apostles and the number of his followers became constantly smaller. He consequently left <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and returned to his home at Gitta. In order to give his scholars there a <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of his higher nature and divine mission and thus regain his authority, he had a grave dug and permitted himself to be buried in it, after previously <a href="12473a.htm">prophesying</a> that after three days he would rise alive from it. But the promised <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection</a> did not take place; Simon died in the grave. The <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Acts of St. Peter give an entirely different account of Simon's conduct at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of his death (<a href="09280b.htm">Lipsius</a>, "Die apokryphen Apostelgeschichten und Apostellegenden", II, Pt. I (Brunswick, 1887). In this work also great stress is laid upon the struggle between Simon and the two Apostles Peter and Paul at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. By his magic arts Simon had also sought to win the <a href="10752c.htm">Emperor Nero</a> for himself, an attempt in which he had been thwarted by the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. As <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> of his doctrines Simon offered to ascend into the heavens before the eyes of <a href="10752c.htm">Nero</a> and the Roman populace; by magic he did rise in the air in the Roman Forum, but the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the Apostles Peter and Paul <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to fall, so that he was severely injured and shortly afterwards died miserably. Arnobius reports this alleged attempt to fly and the death of Simon with still other particulars ("Adv. nationes" ii, xii; cf. "Constit. Apost.", vi, ix). This legend led later to the erection of a church dedicated to the Apostles on the alleged spot of Simon's fall near the Via Sacra above the Forum. The stones of the pavement on which the Apostles <a href="06423a.htm">knelt</a> in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and which are said to contain the impression of their knees, are now in the wall of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Santa Francesca Romana.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>All these narratives belong naturally to the domain of legend. It is evident from them, however, that, according to the tradition of the second century, Simon Magus appeared as an opponent of <a href="05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> and of the Apostles, and as a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> or rather as a <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="10212c.htm">Messias</a> of the <a href="01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> age. This view rests on the sole authoritative historical account of him, that given us by the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>. It cannot be determined how far one or another detail of his later life, as given in essentially legendary form in the authorities of the second century and the following era, may be traced to historical tradition. Baur ("Die christl. Gnosis", 310) and some of his adherents have denied the historical existence of Simon and his <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>. This view, opposed to the account in the Book of Acts, and to the tradition of the second century, is now abandoned by all serious historians. Further this "legendary" Simon was made an essential link by the T&uuml;bingen School of Baur and his followers for historical evidence of the alleged "Petrine" and "Pauline" factions in the early Church, which had fought with one another and from whose union the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> arose. For the same reasons this <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, especially Lipsius, assigns the labors of St. Peter at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which it claims are first made known by these <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings, to the domain of legend. All these theories, however, are without basis and have been abandoned by serious historical scholars, even among non-Catholics (cf. Schmidt, "Petrus in Rom", Lucerne, 1892). A developed system of doctrines is attributed to Simon and his followers in the anti-heretical writings of the early Church, especially in <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103123.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.23</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103400.htm">IV</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103633.htm">VI.33</a>), in the "Philosophumena" (VI, VII sq.), and in Epiphanius ("Haer.", XXII). The work "The Great Declaration" (<em>Apophasis megale</em>) was also ascribed to Simon, and the "Pseudo-Clementines" also present his teaching in detail. How much of this system actually belonged to Simon cannot now be determined. Still his <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> seems to have been a <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, in which he proclaimed himself as the Standing One (<em>estos</em>), the principal emanation of the Deity and the Redeemer. According to <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> he claimed to have appeared in Samaria as the Father, in <a href="08544a.htm">Judea</a> as the Son, and among the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> as the Holy Ghost, a manifestation of the Eternal. He asserted that <a href="07203a.htm">Helena</a>, who went about with him, was the first conception of the Deity, the mother of all, by whom the Deity had created the <a href="01476d.htm">angels</a> and the <a href="01173c.htm">aeons</a>. The cosmic forces had cast her into corporeal bonds, from which she was released by Simon as the great power. In <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> Simon was probably <a href="01564b.htm">Antinomian</a>, an enemy of <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> law. His magical arts were continued by his disciples; these led unbridled, licentious lives, in accordance with the principles which they had learned from their master. At any rate they called themselves Simonians, giving Simon Magus as their founder.</p>
