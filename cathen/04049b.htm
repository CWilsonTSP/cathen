<p>A <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> who has been legitimately received into the ranks of the clergy. By clergy in the strict sense is meant the entire <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>. Consequently a cleric is one who belongs in some sense to the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. For this it is <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> that he have received at least the <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a>. The clergy by Divine right form an order or state which is essentially distinct from that of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a>. (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXIV, De sac. ord., can. i, 6.) Christ did not commit the preaching of the Gospel and the administration of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to the faithful in general, but to certain carefully defined <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>, as the Apostles and seventy-two Disciples. They also received the power of governing the flocks; which power is represented by the Keys, a well-known Oriental symbol for authority. That the distinction between clergy and <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> was recognized in <a href="14530a.htm">New Testament</a> times is plain from <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> statement that the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been placed by the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to rule the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs28">Acts 20:28</a>), for the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to rule implies a correlative <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to obey. Presbyters are continually distinguished from the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> throughout the Pauline Epistles.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The word <em>cleric</em> (Lat., <em>clericus</em> from <em>clerus</em>) is derived from the Greek <em>kleros</em>, a "lot". In the <a href="13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, this word is used in the literal sense quite frequently, though not in its later technical sense. In the First Epistle of St. Peter (v, 3) it is applied to entire body of the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The use of the word in its present restricted meaning occurs, however, as early as the third century. It is found in <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De idol., c. viii), <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. in Jer., xi, 3) and <a href="04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (Quis dives salvetur, c. xlii) in this sense. It is not easy to determine exactly how the word came to have its present determinate meaning. The "Pontificale Romanum" refers to clerics as being those whose "lot" is the Lord Himself, and <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> explicitly derives the name from that fact. These statements do not give us, however, the steps by which <em>kleros</em>, "lot" became "clergy" or "cleric". Probably the best suggested explanation is, that from lot or portion, it came to mean a particular lot or office assigned to some one, and finally the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> himself possessing the lot or office.</p>

<h2>Extension of meaning</h2>

<p>While <em>cleric</em> in its strict sense means one who has received the <a href="14779a.htm">ecclesiastical tonsure</a>, yet in general sense it is also employed in canon law for all to whom clerical privileges have been extended. Such are the members of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders: Monks and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and even <a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a>. It is also applied to tertiaries of the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>. If they be men, however, they must live in community, but if they be <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> they many enjoy the privilege even when living at home. <a href="07280a.htm">Hermits</a> and virgins, or <a href="03481a.htm">celibates</a> whose <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a> are approved by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, have likewise clerical <a href="07690a.htm">immunities</a>. Members of the military <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, such as formerly the <a href="14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a>, and at present the <a href="14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> and Knights of Malta, rank as clerics. The meaning of the word has been so extended as to include even <a href="08748a.htm">laics</a>, men or <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, who render service to a regular community, such as by begging, provided they wear a clerical dress and reside near the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> or <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a>. The privileges enjoyed by thus obtaining the <a href="02476a.htm">benefit of clergy</a> were once great (see <a href="07690a.htm">IMMUNITY</a>), and were formerly recognized by secular governments. In modern times, however, these privileges in as far as they were guaranteed by the <a href="02137c.htm">civil power</a> have been almost entirely swept away in every country of the world. It is only when there is question of favours, or as canonists say, in a favourable sense, that cleric has this wide signification. When there is question of penalties, on the contrary, it becomes so restricted as to mean only the lower orders of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. In <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in <a href="10285c.htm">medieval times</a> the term clerk acquired in common parlance the significance of an <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> man.</p>

<h2>Clerical religious orders</h2>

<p>Among the regular orders in the strict sense, namely those whose members have solemn <a href="15511a.htm">vows</a>, is a large class designated as clerks regular (<em>clerici regulares</em>) because living according to a rule (<em>regula</em>). In contradistinction to the monastic orders, these <a href="11279a.htm">clerical orders</a> were instituted for the purpose of exercising a ministry similar to that of the <a href="13675a.htm">secular clerics</a>, by promotion of the Divine worship and procuring the <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. Their main object is the spiritual and temporal service of their neighbour in <a href="05295b.htm">educating</a> youth, preaching, serving the sick, etc. Orders of clerks regular were first founded in the sixteenth century. To this class belong the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, <a href="02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, and others. Many religious congregations, which are not orders in the strict sense, such as the <a href="11521d.htm">Passionists</a> and <a href="12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> follow a similar mode of life.</p>

<h2>Regionary clerics</h2>

<p>Regionary clerics, who are also called <em>clerici vagantes</em> and <em>acephali</em>, were those who were <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> without title to a special church. They were received into the sacred ministry by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the purpose of supplying the dearth of the clergy in the outlying districts of the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> where no <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> existed. Here they were to act as missionaries and in course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, if possible, to gather together congregations who would build and endow a church. Many of these clerics became mere wanderers without settled occupation or abode, sometimes supporting themselves by filling temporary chaplaincies in the castles of noblemen. In course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a>, numbers of these untitled clerics returned to the settled portions of their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and acted as assistants to such <a href="02473c.htm">beneficed</a> clergymen as chose to accept their help. Owing to the abuses arising from the unsettled state of these vagrant clerics, the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess, XXIII, c. xvi, De ref.) forbade the ordaining in future of any candidate who was not attached to a definite church or <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> institute.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Obligations of clerics</h2>

<p>(1) They must wear a costume suited to their state. While the common canon law does not determine in every detail what the dress of clerics should be, yet many and various prescriptions on the subject are found in the canons, the <a href="04321a.htm">pontifical constitutions</a>, and the decrees of councils. These ordain that the clerics are not to wear the dress of <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>. They must abstain from gaudy colours, unbecoming their state. The wearing of the soutane or cassock on all occasions, even in public, is prescribed for clerics living in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> may command the same in their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. In non-Catholic countries, synods generally prescribe that for public use the dress of clerics should be such as to distinguish them from <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>; that is of black or of a sober colour, and that the so-called Roman collar be worn. In private, clergymen are commonly required to wear the soutane.</p>

<p>(2) Clerics are forbidden to engage in trade and secular business. In the early ages of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, it was allowable to seek necessary sustenance by labour, and that is not forbidden now if the cleric does not receive proper support from <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sources. What is specially prohibited is to engage in trade for the sake of gain. The buying and selling, however, which is necessary in the administration of the lands or the goods of a <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> do not fall under the prohibition. Neither is it forbidden to clerics nowadays to place their money out at interest and receive the increment; for this is equivalent, allowing for modern circumstances, to the <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> management of the lands of <a href="02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. Gambling in stocks, however, remains an illicit form of trade for clergymen (Lehmkuhl, Theol. Mor., II, n. 612).</p>

<p>(3) There are stringent laws concerning the relations of clerics with persons of the other sex. They must conform to the canons in all that regards allowing <a href="15687b.htm">females</a> to dwell in their houses. Above all must they avoid associating with those whose moral character causes the least suspicion.</p>

<p>(4) Unbecoming amusements are also forbidden to them, such as the frequenting of improper plays and spectacles, the visiting of taverns, indulgence in games of chance, carrying of arms, following the chase, etc. When in the above amusements, however, there is no necessary impropriety, lawful <a href="04576a.htm">custom</a> and synodal prescriptions may make a participation in them allowable.</p>

<p>(5) Clerics are bound to obey their <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in all matters determined by the canon law. Various Roman decisions have declared that by his ordinary authority, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> cannot <a href="11189a.htm">oblige</a> clerics to render to him any service not expressed in the canons. While the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of obedience is binding on all clerics, it is strengthened for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> by the solemn promise made at <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and for all holders of <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> by the canonical <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a>. The <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to be subject to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in lawful matters is not, however, a <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a>.</p>

<h2>Loss of clerical privileges</h2>

<p>Although the <a href="03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> received in Sacred orders may not be obliterated, yet even the higher orders of clergy may be degraded from their dignity and reduced to what is technically called lay communion. The same holds, of course, likewise for the lower clergy. When, however, a cleric who has received only <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a> or even <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, after losing his privileges, has been restored to the clerical state, this restitution, even when solemn, is merely ceremonious and is not considered as a new conferring of <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a> or <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. Even minor clerics are therefore considered to have a stable connection with the hierarchical order. See <a href="10332b.htm">MINOR ORDERS</a>; <a href="04647c.htm">DEACON</a>; <a href="14320a.htm">SUBDEACON</a>; <a href="12406a.htm">PRIEST</a>; <a href="07322c.htm">HIERARCHY</a>; <a href="08748a.htm">LAITY</a>.</p>
