<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF REIMS (RHEMENSIS)</p>

<p>The Archdiocese of Reims comprises the district of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> in the Department of Marne (Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne) and the whole Department of Ardennes. It was suppressed by the Concordat of 1802, which put the district of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> in the Diocese of Meaux, and the Department of Ardennes in that of <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, while two episcopal councils were established at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> and Charleville to assist the Bishops of Meaux and Metz in their administration. The archdiocese was re-established in theory by the Concordat of 1817, and in fact in 1821; it was given Amiens and <a href="14130c.htm">Soissons</a> as suffragans in 1821, and Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne and Beauvais in 1822. The <em>Remi</em> (as the Gauls of this region were called), whose capital was <em>Durocortorum</em>, the present <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>, were early reduced to submission by Caesar. In the third century <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> was the capital of <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a> Secundum: the Roman governors resided there, and there Valentinian sojourned in 367. As a centre of culture, it was then considered comparable to Athens, and a beautiful Gallo-Roman gate (the <em>Porte Mars</em>) is still to be seen there. When <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced is not known; it may have developed locally, from the earliest centuries, by the coalition of different groups of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>; but the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization and the succession of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> began only with the mission of Sts. Sixtus and Sinicius, who established their see in the upper part of the city during the second half of the third century. Late traditions have represented St. Sixtus as a disciple of St. Peter, but <a href="07356b.htm">Archbishop Hincmar</a>, in the ninth century, considered him as a disciple of <a href="14031c.htm">Pope St. Sixtus II</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Tradition gives to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> a certain number of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> during the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>; among others, Timotheus, Appolinaris, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> Maurus, and the virgin Macra, whose <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> were gathered by the Roman Eusebius. The <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> erected over their <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> afterwards became a collegiate church under the invocation of St. Timotheus. Imbetausius, who assisted the <a href="01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> (314), was the fourth <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Reims; he transferred his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to the centre of the city. It was much exposed to the barbarian invasions. Victoriously defended, about 366, by the consul Jovinus, a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>, it had for <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, St. Maternian (c. 349-70) and St. Donatian (379-89), the patron of <a href="03005a.htm">Bruges</a> and of West Flanders. It saw the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandals</a> behead the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, St. Nicasius, on the threshold of his church, in 406 or 407, and at the same time kill his sister St. Eutropia, his <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> St. Florens, his <a href="09111a.htm">lector</a> St. Jucundus, and, a short time after, his disciple St. Oriculus, and Sts. Oricula and Basilica, the sisters of St. Oriculus.</p>

<p>St. Remigius (Remi), b. about 440, of a distinguished Gallo-Roman <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, and whom St. Sidonius Appolinaris appreciated very highly as a rhetorician, became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Reims at the age of twenty-two. His history is known through a short biography, falsely attributed to <a href="06149a.htm">Fortunatus</a>, and a longer one, of a legendary character, written by <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> in 878. <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> directed the <a href="03712a.htm">Christianization</a> of the neighboring regions, sending Antimond into the country about Terouanne and Boulogne, St. Vaast into the Arras district, and creating the Bishopric of Laon; he brought about the marriage of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a> with <a href="04066a.htm">St. Clotilda</a>, and <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a> on 24 December, 496. His success had immense political and religious results; the Gallo-Roman populations would not have submitted to <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a> the <a href="06238a.htm">Frank</a>, had he remained a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a>, and his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> made him the protector of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and Aquitaine, whose princes were <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>. The "Testament" of <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> is <a href="01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, as is the letter by which Pope Hormisdas was supposed to have appointed him <a href="09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a> for the whole of Gaul. But it is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> laid the foundations of the political authority and religious power of the <a href="07356b.htm">See of Reims</a>, and that from his time the name of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> was well esteemed and respected at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He died 10 January, 535.</p>

<p>Among the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> who followed him were: St. Nivard (649-72), who caused the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Hauvillers to be rebuilt and established St. Bercarius there; Sr. Rieul (672-98), who built the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Orbais; St. Rigobert (698-743), who <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, was afterwards brutally driven from the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> and replaced by a certain Milo, the king's favourite, and took refuge first in Aquitaine and then at Gernicourt, in the <a href="14130c.htm">Diocese of Soissons</a>, where he died; Tilpin (or <a href="15103a.htm">Turpin</a>, 753-800), a friend of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, whose name was afterwards, not later than the end of the eleventh century, forged to a chronicle of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and Roland, very popular in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.</p>

<p>The political importance of the <a href="07356b.htm">See of Reims</a>, situated geographically between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, was manifested in the ninth century during the episcopates of Ebbo (816-35), whose disagreements with Louis the Debonnaire are matters of history; of <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> (845-82), the most illustrious of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>; of Fulk (883-900), chancellor of Charles the Simple, who maintained the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Carlovingians against Eudes, Count of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, ancestor of the House of Capet; of Herv&eacute; (900-922), who laboured for the conversion of the Normans and, eventually rallying to the Capetians, <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> Robert king in 922. In 925 Count Herbert of Vermandois had his son Hugh, a boy of less than five years of age, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Reims, but in 932 King Raoul caused Artaud (932-61) to be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and Hugh, who insisted upon his <a href="01691a.htm">archepiscopal</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by a council in 948 and by <a href="01203a.htm">Pope Agapetus</a> in 949. The decisive part taken by Archbishop Adalbero (969-88) in the elevation of the Capets to the throne, the political part played by Archbishop Arnould (988-91 and 995-1021), as a partisan of the Carlovingians, and the brief occupancy of the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> by Gerbert (991-95), afterwards Sylvester II, are treated in the articles <a href="07515c.htm">HUGH CAPET</a> and <a href="14371a.htm">POPE SYLVESTER II</a>. Manasses de Gournay (1069-80) was deposed for <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> at the behest of <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> in the Council of Lyons. Henry of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, second son of King Louis VI (1162-75), did much to secure the recognition in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> of <a href="01287a.htm">Pope Alexander III</a> against the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> Octavian, and resisted the attempts of the burghers to form themselves into a commune. William of the White Hands (1176-1202), uncle to <a href="12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> and cousin of Henry II of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, was made a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1179, and was <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> under <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. It was he who granted to the burghers of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1182 the Wilhelmine Charter, a concession to the communal movement. Cardinal Gui de Paray (1204-06), formerly <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, suppressed <a href="09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a> in his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Alb&eacute;ric de Humbert (1206-18) took part in the <a href="01267e.htm">Albigensian</a> War and, in 1211, laid the first stone of the present <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1250, Johel de Mathefelon (1244-50), conferred the office of Grand <a href="01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> on Cardinal Ottoboni nephew of <a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, who became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="01159a.htm">Adrian V</a>. Pierre Babette (1274-98) petitioned <a href="06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> in 1276 for the <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. Louis, and obtained it from <a href="02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> in 1297. The <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Humbert, Dauphin of Viennois, occupied the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> from 1352 to 1355. Guy de Roye (1390-1409), who was killed in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> on his way to the Couicil of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, was the author of the "Dortrinale Sapientiae". <a href="13799a.htm">Simon de Cramaud</a> (1409-13), created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1413, had an important share in putting an end to the Great Schism. Renaud de Chartres (1414-44), made <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1439, chancellor to Charles VII, showed himself very unfavourable to the mission of <a href="08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>; when the heroine was captured (23 May, 1430) he wrote a letter to the inhabitants of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> in a spirit hostile to her, and he took no steps to rescue <a href="08409c.htm">Joan</a> from his suffragan, Bishop Cauchon of Beauvais. Reynaud was one of the plenipotentiaries who signed the Treaty of Arras between Charles VII and the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Jacques Juvenel des Ursins (1444-9) was commissioned by Charles VII, in 1447, to notify Amadeus of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a> that he must abdicate the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> throne, and to treat with <a href="11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> for the restoration of peace to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Jean Juvenel des Ursins (1449-73) was ordered by <a href="03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> to revise the process of <a href="08409c.htm">Blessed Joan of Arc</a>; he also wrote a history of the reign of Charles VI. Guillaume Briconnet was created <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1493 and occupied the <a href="07356b.htm">See of Reims</a> from 1497 to 1507. His successor, Charles Dominique de Carrette (1507-8) was <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Final after 1505. Robert de Lenoncourt (1508-32) enriched the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> with sumptuous tapestries representing the life and death of the Blessed Virgin, and the Church of St. Remigius with tapestries on the life of its titular saint.</p>

<p>In 1553 the House of Lorraine began to acquire a hold on the <a href="07356b.htm">See of Reims</a>, where it was first represented by John V of Lorraine (1533-8), next by Cardinal Charles of Lorraine (1538-74), and then by Cardinal Louis de <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> (1574-88). In 1585 <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> had taken sides with the League, and the Duke of Mayenne and the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de St. Paul ruled as masters in the city until 1594. The "Journalier" of Jean Pussot, the carpenter, is even now a capital source of information on the League spirit which animated the people of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>, showing at the same time how they gradually rallied to <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>. Philippe du Bec, one of the <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> who had laboured most earnestly for Henry IV's conversion, was by him nominated <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Reims in January, 1595. The <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was next occupied by another <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a>, Louis of Lorraine, made a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1615. At his death the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> was given to William Gifford, an Englishman by origin. This personage, who had been successively canon-theologian of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> under <a href="03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>, dean of St. Peter's at <a href="09251a.htm">Lille</a>, <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the University of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>, a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Beno&icirc;t en Voivre, at <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, and founder of two <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> houses at St. Malo and <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, spent his whole life helping the expatriated <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the apostles who were going thence, with all caution, to strengthen <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. He wrote a treatise on <a href="12378a.htm">predestination</a> and a work against the <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> entitled "Calvino-Furcismus". His successor, in 1629, Henry of Lorraine, the adventurous <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a> who afterwards attempted an expedition against <a href="10683a.htm">Naples</a>, never received <a href="11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>, and in 1641 <a href="13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> compelled him to give up the emoluments of the <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. In the course of the seventeenth century two religious <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> who belonged to the <a href="07074a.htm">House of Guise</a> had also been abbesses at St-Pierre-les-Dames at Reims, and <a href="09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>, at the age of six, had spent some time and received a part of her <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> there.</p>

<p>Among the later <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> may be mentioned: Antonio Barberini (1657-71), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1627; <a href="09200c.htm">Charles-Maurice Le Tellier</a> (1671-1710), who, unhappily, caused to be demolished the superb <a href="01691a.htm">archepiscopal</a> palace raised by men of preceding ages, distinguished himself by his <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and his antipathy to Roman doctrines, and bequeathed his magnificent <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> to the Abbey of Ste-Genevi&ecirc;ve at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Fran&ccedil;ois de Mailly (1710-31), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1698; Charles-Antoine de La Roche Aymon (1762-77), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1771; Alexandre-Ang&eacute;lique de Tallyrand-P&eacute;rigord (1777-1801), who was a deputy in the States-General of 1789, combated the project of the civil constitution of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> in several of his writings, <a href="10291a.htm">emigrated</a> under the <a href="13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, refused to resign after the Concordat, remained near Louis XVIII after 1803, returned with him to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in 1814, accepted his dismissal from the Archbishopric of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1816, and in 1817 was made a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>; Jean-Baptiste-Marie-Antoine de Latil (1824-39), <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the future Charles X from 1804, <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1826, joined Charles X in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, and spent the last nine years of his life away from his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> <a href="06684b.htm">Thomas Gousset</a> (1840-66), <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1851; the writer and preacher <a href="08784b.htm">Landriot</a> (1867-74), famous during the Franco-German War through his protest against the military execution of Abb&eacute; Miroy, one of his <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, by the <a href="06484b.htm">Germans</a> in the middle of an armistice; Beno&icirc;t-Marie Lang&eacute;nieux (1874-1905), one of the most illustrious <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the end of the nineteenth century, who took the initiative of leading pilgrimages of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> workmen to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and thus played a part in the great social movement which culminated in the encyclical "Rerum Novarum". He presided in 1893, as <a href="09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, at the Eucharistic Congress in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, when all the <a href="05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>, whether united with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> or separated, bore testimony to their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Eucharist. He was the first <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to visit the Holy Land since the Cuusades. In 1896 he organized the festival to celebrate the fourteenth centenary of the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a>.</p>

<p>In the Merovingian period, <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> apparently enjoyed <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supremacy over the eleven cities of <a href="14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, <a href="03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, Vermand, <a href="01752c.htm">Arras</a>, <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, <a href="14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, Senlis, <a href="02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, Terouanne, and Boulogne; and when <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> detached a part of his own diocese to form that of Laon, it made one more suffragan for <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. The erection of the Bishopric of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> into an <a href="01694b.htm">archepiscopal see</a> by a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 May,1559, took from the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> the Dioceses of <a href="03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, <a href="01752c.htm">Arras</a>, and <a href="14798a.htm">Tournai</a>. At the same time the See of Terouanne was suppressed, and out of its territory three new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were made: one of them, Boulogne, dependent on <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>; the other two, <a href="11251a.htm">St. Omer</a> and Ypres, dependent on Cambrai and <a href="10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>, <em>legati nati</em> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, had, as <a href="12423b.htm">primates</a>, <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the other <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Gaul. From the time of Louis IV D'Outre-Mer they had been counts. They were entitled to coin money, had their town guard, and levied armies. As soon as a new <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was elected he made a visitation of his suffragans; in each city, on the arrival of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, business was suspended, the people and the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, magistrates, even princes, went to meet him, <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a> were thrown open, and exiles were recalled from banishment. The inhabitants of Saint-Quentin and Saint-Val&eacute;ry were under his judicial <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and had to bring their pleas to the <a href="01691a.htm">archepiscopal</a> court of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. In 999 a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Sylvester II recognized the right of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> to crown the kings, and, at the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Philip I, Archbishop Gervais took advantage of the presence of the <a href="09118a.htm">papal legates</a> to proclaim once more this right, which right <a href="01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, by a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 1179, prohibited any other <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from arrogating to himself. Louis VII, at his <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>, raised the Countship of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> to the rank of a duchy and peerage of the kingdom.</p>

<p>On the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a>, as built by Archbishop Robert de Lenoncourt, there are niched figures representing the twelve peers who carry the symbols of the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>: on the right, the six spiritual peers &mdash; the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Reims, who anointed the king; the Bishop-Duke of Laon, who held the sacred <em><a href="01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em>; the Bishop-Duke of <a href="08789c.htm">Langres</a>, with the sceptre; the Bishop-Count of <a href="02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, with the emblazoned surcoat; the Bishop-Count of <a href="03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>, with the royal ring; the Bishop-Count of Noyon, with the baldric &mdash; and on the left the six temporal peers &mdash; the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, holding the crown; the Dukes of Guyenne and Normandy, and the Counts of Champagne, <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. The ceremonies of the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> presented two characteristic features: the use of the sacred <em><a href="01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em> and the touching for scrofula (king's <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>). According to the legend &mdash; of which, however, <a href="02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a>, a witness of the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, was <a href="07648a.htm">ignorant</a> in the fifth century, and the first trace of which appears in <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> &mdash; the holy <em><a href="01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em> was brought by a dove to <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> when he was in the act of crowning <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a>. This <em><a href="01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em> was a small crystal vial, two-thirds full of balm; its superb ornamentation was added later. It was kept at Saint-Remi, in a <a href="12762a.htm">reliquary</a> which also contained a golden needle and a silver <a href="11541b.htm">paten</a>. When needed for a <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a>, the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint-Remi brought it to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The golden needle was used to mix the balm, taken from the <em><a href="01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em>, with charism on the silver <a href="11541b.htm">paten</a>. The holy <em><a href="01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em> left <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> only once, when Louis XI, being sick at Plessis-les-Tours in 1483, hoped that an unction from it would cure him. The authenticity of the sacred <em><a href="01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em> began to be questioned when <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> could not be <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> because the <a href="07074a.htm">Guises</a> occupied Champagne; on this occasion an <em><a href="01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em> was used which was preserved at the abbey of Marmoutiers, and which had cured St. Martin. Jean-Jacques Chifflet, first physician to Philip IV of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1651 wrote a book expressly to disprove the authenticity of the <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> <em><a href="01439c.htm">ampulla</a></em>. In 1793 the vial was broken in the public square of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>; but a few days before this was done, a Constitutional <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> had taken out some of the balm and put it in a place of safety; it was from this portion that Charles X was anointed. The legendary privilege of healing scrofula on the day of the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> was supposed to have been given by <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> to the kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and confirmed to them by St. Marcoul, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Nanteuil (d. 552), whose remains rested after the ninth century at Corbeny, in the Diocese of Laon &mdash; hence the <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> made by several kings, after their consecration, to Corbeny. Louis XIII was the last king to make this <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> (in 1610); Louis XVI had the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Marcoul brought to the Abbey of Saint-Remi, so as to avoid going out of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Louis XVIII did not touch for the scrofula, but Charles X did, the day after his <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>, at the <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Saint-Marcoul, changing the formula, "Le roi te touche, Dieu te gu&eacute;rit" (The king touches thee, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> heals thee), to "Le roi te touche, Dieu te guerisse" (The king touches thee, may <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> heal thee).</p>

<p>Several of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> visited <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>. In the early days of the <a href="03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> dynasty it was the scene of two famous interviews: between <a href="14288c.htm">Stephen III</a> and Pepin the Short, and between <a href="09157b.htm">Leo III</a> and <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. In 816 Louis the Debonnaire was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> by <a href="14289b.htm">Stephen V</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> conferred the title of <a href="02078b.htm">Augusta</a> on Queen Ermengarde. <a href="09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> came to <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> in September, 1049, during the episcopate of Guy de Chatillion; he <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the church of <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a>, and decreed that thenceforward the feast of that saint should be kept of the first day of October, throughout the whole kingdom. During the episcopate of Raoul de Verd, Pope <a href="03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> presided at a council held at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> from 20 to 30 October, 1119. <a href="11100b.htm">St. Norbert</a> came thither barefoot and in penitential garb, and Callistus confirmed the authority granted to him by Pope Galasius, to preach the Gospel in all places. The council drew up a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> for the <a href="15068a.htm">Truce of God</a>, and <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="06795b.htm">Bourdin</a>, the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, and the Emperor Henry. <a href="08012a.htm">Pope Innocent II</a>, on 19 October, 1131, in the episcopate of Renard de Martign&eacute;, opened at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> a council at which <a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> appeared, and the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> Anacletus was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. While this council was sitting, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> (25 October) Louis the Younger, afterward Louis VII, in the presence of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> Louis VI. Lastly, at the request of Bernard, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, he <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> St. Godehard. <a href="05599a.htm">Pope Eugene III</a>, on 22 March, 1148, opened at Rheims a council at which St. Bernard forced Gilbert de La Porr&eacute;e to retract his <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> on the essence of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, and Samson de Mauvoisin, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Reims, caused Eon de l'Etoile to be condemned.</p>

<p>From the ninth century to the eleventh, the buildings of a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> founded by St. Gombert were used by poor children who desired to learn, who lived on <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>, <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a> in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Patrick, and attended the chapter <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. This was the origin of the "Coll&egrave;ge de Bons Enfants", the functions of which were regulated by Juhel's Charter, in 1245, and which prepared a certain number of boys for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Between 1544 and 1546, Paul Grand Raoul, the <em>scholasticus</em> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>, had the college rebuilt, and it was in this building, by that time still further enlarged, that Cardinal Charles of Lorraine installed the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, for which he had obtained from <a href="11579a.htm">Paul III</a> a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of erection (5 January, 1548) and the foundation of which was sanctioned by Henry II in March, 1548. It was to comprise the four faculties of arts, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, and medicine. The faculty of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> was completed through the liberality of Antoine* Fournier (b. at Reims, 1532), who administered the <a href="10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a> for another Charles of Lorraine. The <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was the stronghold of the League in Champagne, and in 1588 it adhered to the solemn declaration by which the Sorbonne declared the French people to be absolved from their <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to Henry III after the assassination of the <a href="07074a.htm#vii">Duke of Guise</a>. But when <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> had had himself <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, and the most fiery Leaguers of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> were contemplating going into exile, the faculty of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> gave the signal for submission. In 1606, when, through the favour of Archdeacon Fran&ccedil;ois Brulart, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> set up a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at Reims, they asked to be incorporated in the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, and in 1609 they obtained their request. Repeated conflicts, however, arose between the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, first in 1617, then in 1660 and 1664, again in 1722 on the question of <a href="08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, and again in 1752. In 1682 the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> adhered to the Four Articles, and in 1688, when <a href="02081a.htm">Innocent</a> <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Lavardin, <a href="09371a.htm">Louis XIV's</a> ambassador, it voted by acclamation in favour of an appeal to a council. Until 1723 it refused to submit to the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, and one of its <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>, Jean Lacourt, was even sent to the Bastille at this time for six months. (On the foundations at the University of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> made in the sixteenth century with a view to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apostolate in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, see <a href="01322b.htm">WILLIAM ALLEN</a>.)</p>

<p>The chapter of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> possessed <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> over 150 villages of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. History records as having been members of that chapter 5 <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, 23 <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, 53 <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and a considerable number of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>; pursuant to what was known as the "Jouanine privilege". Obtained under Jean de Craon, its members were exempt from all <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> except the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a>. Among them may be mentioned: <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, founder of the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> (1030-1101), who was at one time <em>scholasticus</em> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>; Otton of Ch&acirc;tillon, who became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1088 under the name of <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a>; Guillaume Coquillart, who died about 1490, in his younger days, as a <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> student, the author of celebrated jocose poems; Maucroix (1619-95), the friend of <a href="02623a.htm">Boileau</a> and La Fontaine. A very curious festival which the chapter used to hold in the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was the procession of the herrings. At the beginning of <a href="09152a.htm">Lent</a>, they went in Indian file from the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to St-Remi, each dragging a herring after him by a thread &mdash; a symbol of the <a href="09152a.htm">Lenten</a> abstinence &mdash; and each trying to put his foot on the herring dragged by the next canon ahead of him.</p>

<p>The celebrated <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. The edifice raised by <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> having been destroyed by a fire in 1211, Bishop Alb&eacute;ric de Humbert undertook to build the present <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in its place. It was completed in 100 years &mdash; from 1211 to 1311 &mdash; and hence the admirable unity of design and execution which characterize it as an example of <a href="06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>. Jean d'Orbais seems to have been the first architect, originating the plan and building the <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a>; the great doorway, <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> with the famous gallery containing forty-two <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a> of kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, is chiefly the work of Robert de Coucy, in the beginning of the fourteenth century. In the treasury of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is preserved the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a> of <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> (see illustration to <a href="03561a.htm">CHALICE</a>), from which the kings of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> used to communicate under the species of wine at the end of the <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> ceremonies, and which, according to tradition, was cut from the gold of the celebrated vase of <a href="14130c.htm">Soissons</a> broken by one of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis's</a> soldiers. On 1 Feb., 1886, the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> was affiliated to the illustrious Lateran Basilica, thereby participating in the privilege of all the <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and spiritual favours attached to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1891 the canons of St. Peter at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> presented to the chapter at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> a portion of the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="11781b.htm">St. Petronilla</a>; the translation of these sacred bones to <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> took place on <a href="15614b.htm">Whitsunday</a>, 1892.</p>

<p>The <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St-Remi was long independent of the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. The present church of St-Remi was begun in 1005 by Airard, <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and some of the capitals date from that period. The work was resumed on a simpler plan by Abbot Thierry in 1039, when the south <a href="15018a.htm">transept</a> was built; the <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> dates from 1170, in the time of Abbot de Celles. Carloman, Louis IV D'Outre-Mer, Lothair, and <a href="07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> wished to be buried in this church. Its treasure, made up of the offerings of kings and princes who visited the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a>, would be of considerable value if it had not been brought into requisition on several occasions of public necessity &mdash; now to ransom a royal <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, now to supply money for the purposes of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>. Then, acting at the king's behest, the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> issued an order that the gold and silver <a href="12762a.htm">reliquaries</a> (<em>chasses</em>) should be sent to the mint; the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> received specie to the amount of one-fourth the value of the metal coined, and the balance in promissory notes which were rarely redeemed. The church of St-Remi has been a "minor basilica" since 28 June, 1870.</p>

<p>The church of Ste-Clotilde, the foundation stone of which was laid on 26 June, 1898, on the centenary of the <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a>, was opened in March, 1901, and raised to the rank of a <a href="02325a.htm">basilica</a> by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 5 March, 1902. At present it possesses 70 <em>chasses</em> and nearly 1000 <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>. The centenary celebration drew together an attendance of 77 <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> and 69 <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, and was the occasion of seven congresses. <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> sent Mgr. Ciocci, pontifical master of ceremonies, to preside at the solemn recognition of the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> and their transfer to a new chasse. The same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> granted to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the privilege of a national jubilee, and wrote a Latin "Ode to France", which was the inspiration of Theodore Dubois's <a href="11270a.htm">oratorio</a> "The Baptism of <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a>". The <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Saint-Marcoul was founded in 1645 by Marguerite Rousselet for cases of contagious scrofula &mdash; i.e. tuberculosis. It was the first institution to practise isolation of tuberculosis patients.</p>

<p>The <a href="04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Charles VII at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> (17 July, 1429), brought about by <a href="08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>, is an historical event of especial importance. <a href="08409c.htm">Joan's</a> father was present at the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, and had his lodgings at <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> in the "H&ocirc;tel de l'Ane Ray&eacute;"; the archives of the city still preserve the accounts of expenses incurred for his entertainment. <a href="08409c.htm">Joan</a> wrote from <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a> (17 July) a letter to Philip the Good, Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, inviting him to make peace; in August, 1429, and March, 1430, she wrote from Bray-sur-Seine and from Sully three letters to her "very dear and good friends and loyal Frenchmen, dwelling in the city of Reims", exhorting them not to lose heart under the renewed menaces of the Duke of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and the English.</p>

<p>The Abbey of Hautvilliers, in the Diocese of <a href="07356b.htm">Reims</a>, was the original home of the <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a>.
