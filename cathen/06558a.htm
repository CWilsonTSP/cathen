<p>A renowned <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, general, and statesman; b. about 1310 at Cuenca in New Castile; d. 23 Aug., 1367, at the Castle of Bonriposo, near <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His father, Don Garcia, was a descendant of King Alfonso V of <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a>, and his mother, Teresa de Luna, belonged to the royal house of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. After studying <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, he became royal almoner, soon after <a href="01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Calatrava, and, finally, on 13 May, 1338, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo. In 1340 he accompanied King Alfonso XI on his campaign against the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a>, saved the life of the king in the battle of Rio Salado on 30 Oct., 1340, and took part in the siege of Algeciras in 1344. As <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo he held two reform <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a>, one at Toledo in May, 1339 (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXV, 1143-8), the other at <a href="01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>, in April, 1347 (<a href="09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXVI, 123-6). In March, 1350, Alfonso XI was succeeded by his son Pedro "El Cruel", whom Albornoz on various occasions severely rebuked for his cruelty and lasciviousness. As a result the king conceived a deadly <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> of him and sought his life. The <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> fled from <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and took refuge at the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> court in <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where <a href="04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> received him kindly and created him <a href="03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of San Clemente, 17 Dec., 1350, whereupon Albornoz resigned as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo. Two years and a half later <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> entrusted him with the restoration of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority in the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territories of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> appointing him <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> and <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> with extraordinary powers was issued on 30 June, 1353. During the sojourn of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territories of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> had, to all intents and purposes, become lost to the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>. The intrepid <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> set out for <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the autumn of 1353 at the head of a small army of mercenaries. After gaining the support of the influential Archbishop Giovanni Visconti of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> and that of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and <a href="13779a.htm">Siena</a>, he began his military operations against the powerful Giovanni di Vico, Prefect of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Lord of <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> and usurper of a large tract of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> territory. The latter was defeated in the battle of <a href="11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, 10 March, 1354. A treaty was concluded at <a href="10529a.htm">Montefiascone</a> on 5 June, whereupon Giovanni di Vico made his submission to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> at <a href="11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>. In order to gain the support of the prefect for the future, the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> appointed him Governor of <a href="03798b.htm">Corneto</a> for twelve years. <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> was displeased at the easy terms of the treaty, but the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> justified his act by pointing out the necessity of <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> for his final success. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had already previously sent Cola di Rienzi, the former tribune of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> to be used by the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> as he saw fit. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> did not trust the visionary Rienzi, and for a time kept him at <a href="11736a.htm">Perugia</a>; but upon the repeated request of the Romans and of Rienzi himself, he finally appointed him Senator of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to replace Guido dell' Isola who showed himself powerless against the intrigues of the Roman nobility. On 1 Aug., 1354, Rienzi entered <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was hailed by the people as a liberator. Soon, however, his cruelty, his oppressive taxes, and his costly revelries made him <a href="07149b.htm">hated</a>, and during a popular tumult on 8 Oct., 1354, he fell a victim to the fury of the mob. After the fall of Rienzi, the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> restored order in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The submission of Giovanni di Vico resulted in the return of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> (in their narrow sense) and the Duchy of <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> to <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. Albornoz now turned his attention to the restoration of the <a href="01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a> and the Romagna. After gaining to his side <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> da Mogliano of Fermo and Ridolfo da Varano of <a href="03216c.htm">Camerino</a>, he began military operations against the two powerful <a href="09566a.htm">Malatestas</a> of <a href="13057c.htm">Rimini</a>. The <a href="09566a.htm">Malatestas</a> allied themselves with their enemy, Francesco degli Ordelaffi, who had usurped a large part of the Romagna. They also won over the faithless <a href="06422a.htm">Gentile</a> da Mogliano. Ridolfo da Varano, to whom the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> had given the supreme command of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> army, gained a signal victory over Galeotto de' Malatesta near Paterno, and on 2 June, 1355, a treaty was concluded with the <a href="09566a.htm">Malatestas</a>, which was approved by <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> on 20 June. Henceforth the <a href="09566a.htm">Malatestas</a> were faithful allies of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> forces. Their submission was soon followed by that of <a href="10528a.htm">Montefeltro</a>, which brought the districts of <a href="15221b.htm">Urbino</a> and Cagli under the power of the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Shortly after, the cities of <a href="14013a.htm">Sinigaglia</a> and <a href="01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and the two brothers Bernardino and Guido da Polenta, Lords of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and Cervia, submitted to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Towards the end of 1355 Albornoz was appointed <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sabina. Giovanni and Riniero de' Manfredi, of <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, and Francesco degli Ordelaffi, of the Romagna, stubbornly refused to submit. In 1356 a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> was preached against them by order of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The Manfredi surrendered <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a> to Albornoz, 10 Nov., 1356, but Ordelaffi and his wife, the warlike Marzia, were still unconquered. The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> had repeatedly asked <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> to be recalled to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Now that all the usurpers of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> with the exception of Ordelaffi had been subdued, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> granted his request and sent Androin de la Roche, <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, to replace him in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Before returning to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> held a meeting of the vicars of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> territory on 29 April, 1357, and the two following days. At this meeting he published his famous Constitutions for the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, "Constitutiones Sanct&aelig; Matris Ecclesi&aelig;", generally known as the "Egidian Constitutions". When he made known to the assembled vicars his intention to return to <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, they all urged him to remain, at least till September. He reluctantly consented and at once began military operations against Ordelaffi. On 21 June he took Cesena, and Bertinoro fell into his hands on 25 July. When the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> departed for <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in September, Ordelaffi was still master of Forl&igrave; and a few other strongholds of the Romagna. On 23 October the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> arrived at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, was received with high honours by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and hailed as "Pater Ecclesi&aelig;".</p>

<p>Albornoz remained only a short time at <a href="02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. His successor in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, lacked the military training to contend successfully with the skilled and valiant Ordelaffi. Moreover, the intrigues of Giovanni di Vico in the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> and fresh disturbances in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> required the presence of Albornoz in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered him to return thither in December, 1358. He at once began operations against Ordelaffi, whose endeavours to buy the Condottiere Lando and his Grand Company into his service he frustrated by a contract with Lando. Ordelaffi was finally compelled to surrender, and on 4 July, 1359, the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> took possession of Forl&igrave;. He allowed Ordelaffi to rule as <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> vicar over Forlimpopoli and Castrocaro. In <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, during the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> absence, the people had established the <em>septemviri</em> to rule jointly with the senator. Deeming it imprudent to go against the will of the people, he consented to the new arrangement, but reserved the appointment of the senator to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. With the exception of Bologna, the entire pontifical territory now again acknowledged the sovereignty of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Giovanni d'Ollegio, who had possession of Bologna, was engaged in a <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with Bernab&ograve; Visconti of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who attempted to become master of Bologna. Unable to contend with the powerful Bernab&ograve;, Giovanni d'Ollegio surrendered Bologna to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who tried in vain to arrive at an amicable arrangement with Bernab&ograve;. Meanwhile <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> had died (12 Sept., 1362). Albornoz refused the <a href="14714c.htm">tiara</a> which was offered him, and <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a> was elected <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Under him Albornoz continued his military operations against Bernab&ograve;, whose stubborn resistance was the principal obstacle to the <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> which <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a> intended to undertake against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a>. When all other attempts failed, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> published a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against, Bernab&ograve; in the spring of 1363. In April the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> gained a victory at Salaruolo, near <a href="10413a.htm">Modena</a>, and the complete subjection of this stubborn tyrant was now only a question of time. But the <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="15097a.htm">Turks</a> had so completely taken possession of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> that on 13 March, 1364, a hurried peace was concluded, the conditions of which were extremely favourable to Bernab&ograve;, who received 500,000 gold florins for his surrender of the city and principality of Bologna.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> had now completed the difficult task that had been entrusted to him by <a href="08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>. He had again subjected the whole pontifical territory to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority and thereby made it possible for the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to return to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But he did not receive the gratitude which he had so well earned. <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a> gave credence to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> enemies who accused him of having misappropriated <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> moneys. In consequence the management of the temporal affairs of the Romagna was taken from Albornoz and given to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Hereupon the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> asked to be recalled from <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and addressed a letter to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in which he gave an account of his management. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> discovered his mistake and in his answer gave due credit for the inestimable service which Albornoz had performed for the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a>. In 1367 <a href="15214a.htm">Urban V</a> returned to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Albornoz received him at <a href="15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, but died before the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> came to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In accordance with his wish he was buried in the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Francis at <a href="01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, but four years later his remains were transferred to Toledo. His Constitutions for the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> were among the earliest books printed in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> (Jesi, 1473); they remained in force until 1816. He is also the author of a compilation of all the documents relating to the subjection of the <a href="01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>. They are preserved in the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> archives under the title "Codex legationis Cardinalis Egidii Albornotii". In his will (29 Sept., 1364) he provided for the foundation of the Spanish College of St. Clement at Bologna (Collegium Albornotianum) with 24 Spanish students and 2 <a href="03579b.htm">chaplains</a>.</p>

<p>Rashdall (Hist. of Universities, Oxford, 1895, I, 200) says that it was the first Continental college "on a scale at all approaching that with which we are familiar in the English Universities", and was the model of many others in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. It still flourishes upon its ancient site, in sumptuously adorned sixteenth-century buildings, under control of the Spanish Government, which sends thither candidates for the diplomatic service who have the <a href="01756c.htm">B.A. degree</a> of a Spanish <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>.</p>
