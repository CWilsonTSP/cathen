<p>(FABIUS CLAUDIUS GORDIANUS FULGENTIUS).</p>

<p>Born 468, died 533. <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="13230c.htm">Ruspe</a> in the province of Byzacene in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, eminent among the <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> for saintly life, eloquence and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> learning. His grandfather, Gordianus, a senator of Carthage, was despoiled of his possessions by the invader Genseric, and banished to <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, his two sons returned after his death, and, though their house in Carthage had been made over to <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, they recovered some <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> in Byzacene. Fulgentius was born at Telepte in that province. His father, Claudius, soon died, and he was brought up by his mother, Mariana. He studied Greek letters before Latin "quo facilius posset, victurus inter Afros, locutionem Graecam, servatis aspirationibus, tamquam ibi nutritus exprimere". We learn from these words of his biographer that the Greek aspirates were hard for a Latin to pronounce. We are told that Fulgentius at an early age committed all Homer to memory, and throughout his life his pronunciation of Greek was excellent. He was also well trained in Latin literature. As he grew older, he governed his house wisely in subjection to his mother. He was favored by the provincial authorities, and made <a href="12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the fiscus. But a desire of <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a> came over him: he practiced austerities privately in the world for a time, until he was moved by the <a href="../fathers/1801036.htm"><em>Enarration on Psalm 36</em></a> of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> to betake himself to a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> which had been founded by a <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Faustus near his episcopal city, from which like other <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> he had been exiled by the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandal</a> king, Hunneric. The fervent appeal of the young man won his admission from Faustus, to whom he was already well known. His mother clamored with tears at the door of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> to see her son; but he gave no sign of his presence there. He became ill from excessive abstinence, but recovered without renouncing it. His worldly goods he made over to his mother, leaving his younger brother dependent on her.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>But Faustus was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to fly from renewed <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and by his advice Fulgentius sought a small <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> not far off, whose <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Felix, had been his friend in the world. Felix insisted upon resigning his office to Fulgentius. A contest of <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> ended in the agreement of all that Fulgentius should be co-abbot. Felix cared for the house, and Fulgentius instructed the brethren; Felix showed charity to the guests, Fulgentius edified them with discourse. A raid of <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> made it <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to remove to a safer spot, and a new retreat was started at Idida in Mauretania, but Fulgentius soon left Felix, having conceived an ardent desire to visit the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, for he had been reading the "Institutiones" and "Collationes" of Cassian, and he also hoped to be no longer superior, and to be able to keep yet stricter abstinence. He took ship at Carthage for Alexandria with a companion named Redemptus. On his arrival at <a href="14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>, the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, Eulalius, told him. "The lands to which you wish to travel are separated from the communion of Peter by an <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> quarrel". Fulgentius therefore stopped a few months with Eulalius, and then sought further advice from an exiled <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his own province, who was living as a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> on a tiny island off the coast of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. He was recommended to return to his own <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but "not to forget the Apostles". In consequence, he made a <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was present at a speech made by <a href="14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> before the senate, and had an opportunity of despising all the magnificence the court of the Gothic king could show. His return was hailed with <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and a nobleman of Byzacene gave him fertile land on which he established a new <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. But Fulgentius retired from his position as superior in order to live a more hidden life in a large and strict <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> which flourished on a rocky island. Here he worked, read, and contemplated. He was an accomplished scribe, and could make fans of palm leaves. Felix, however, refused to submit to the loss of his brother <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and he got Bishop Faustus to claim Fulgentius as his own <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> and to order his return to Felix. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> ensured his continuance as <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> by ordaining him <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>.</p>

<p>At this time the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> King Thrasimund (496-523), though not so cruel a persecutor as his predecessors, allowed no <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be elected in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>. It was decided in 508 by such <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> as could manage to meet together that it was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="06147a.htm">brave</a> this <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, and it was decreed that elections should take place quietly and simultaneously in all the vacant sees, before the Government had time to take preventive measures. Fulgentius was nominated in several cities; but he had fled into hiding, and could not be found. When he thought all the appointments had been made, he reappeared, but the seaport of <a href="13230c.htm">Ruspe</a>, where the election had been delayed through the <a href="01381d.htm">ambition</a> of a <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the place, promptly elected him; and against his will he was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a town he had never seen. He insisted on retaining his monastic habits. He refused all ease and continued his <a href="05789c.htm">fasts</a>. He had but one poor tunic for winter and summer; he wore no <em>orarium</em>, but used a leathern girdle like a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>; nor would he wear <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> shoes, but went barefoot or with sandals. He had no precious <a href="03639a.htm">chasuble</a> (casula), and did not permit his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> to have any. Under his <a href="03639a.htm">chasuble</a> he wore a grey or buff (?) cloak. The same tunic served day and night, and even for the holy Sacrifice, at which, said he, the heart and not the garment should be changed. His first care at <a href="13230c.htm">Ruspe</a> was to get the citizens to build him a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, of which he made Felix <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, and he never lived without <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> around him. But very soon all the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were exiled. Fulgentius was one of the juniors among the 60 African <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> collected in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, but in their meetings his opinion was eagerly sought, and the letters sent in the name of all were always drawn up by him. He also frequently composed pastoral letters for individual colleagues to send to their flocks. Fulgentius had brought a few <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> with him to <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, and he joined with two other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and their companions in a common life, so that their house became the <a href="11264c.htm">oracle</a> of the city of <a href="03139c.htm">Calaris</a>, and a centre of peace, consolation, and instruction.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It was perhaps about the year 515 that Thrasimund issued a series of ten questions as a challenge to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the reputation of Fulgentius was now so great that the king sent for him to Carthage to speak in the name of the rest. The saint, during his stay in that city, gave constant instructions in the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, and reconciled many who had been rebaptized by the <a href="01707c.htm">Arians</a>. He discussed with many wise <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> the replies to be made to the ten questions, and at length submitted to the king a small but able work which we still possess under the title of "Contra Arianos liber unus, ad decem objectiones decem responsiones continens". The king then proposed further objections, but was anxious to avoid a second reply as effective as the former one. He took the unfair and tyrannical course of having the new questions, which were expressed at great length, read aloud once to Fulgentius, who was not allowed to have a copy of them, but was expected to give direct answers; though the public would not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> whether he had really replied to the point or not. When the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> pointed out that he could not even recollect the questions after hearing them but once, the king declared that he showed a want of confidence in his own case. Fulgentius was therefore <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to write a larger work, "Ad Trasimundum regem Vandalorum libri tres", which is a very fine specimen of careful and <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> argument.</p>

<p>Thrasimund seems to have been pleased with this reply. An <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Pinta produced an answer which, with Fulgentius's refutation of it, is lost to us. The work now entitled "Adversus Pintam" is spurious. The king wished to keep Fulgentius at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, but the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were afraid of his influence and his power of converting, and therefore obtained his exile. He was put on board ship at night, that the people of Carthage might not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> of his departure. But contrary winds <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> the vessel to remain several days in port, and nearly all the city was able to take leave of the <a href="07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to receive <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> from his hand. To a religious man who was weeping he privately prophesied his speedy return and the liberty of the African Church.</p>

<p>Fulgentius was accompanied to <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> by many of his monastic brethren. Instead, therefore, of proceeding to his former abode, he obtained permission from the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="03139c.htm">Calaris</a> to build an <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> hard by the Basilica of <a href="13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a>, and there he ruled over forty <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, who observed the strictest renunciation of private <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, while the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> saw to all their wants with great charity and discretion; but if any <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> asked for anything, he refused him at once, saying that a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> should be content with what he is given, and that <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> religious have renounced their own will, "parati nihil velle et nolle". This severity in a particular point was no doubt tempered by the <a href="04171a.htm">saint's</a> sweetness of disposition and charm of manner, with which was associated a peculiarly winning and moving eloquence. He wrote much during his second exile. The Scythian <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, led by <a href="10073a.htm">John Maxentius</a> at Constantinople, had been trying to get their formula approved at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>: "One of the Trinity was crucified". At the same time they were attacking the traces of Semipelagianism in the works of <a href="06019b.htm">Faustus of Riez</a>. On the latter point they had full sympathy from the exiles in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, whose support they had asked. Fulgentius wrote them a letter in the name of the other <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> (Ep. 15), and composed a work "Contra Faustum" in seven books, which is now lost. It was just completed when, in 523, Thrasimund died, and his successor, Hilderic, restored liberty to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Africa.</p>

<p>The exiles returned, and new <a href="04276a.htm">consecrations</a> took place for all the vacant <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a>. When the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> landed at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Fulgentius had an enthusiastic reception, and his journey to Ruspe was a triumphal progress. He returned to his beloved <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but insisted on Felix being sole superior; and he, who was consulted first among all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province, asked leave in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the least things from the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> Felix. He delivered in writing to the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> a deed by which it was perpetually exempted from the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="13230c.htm">Ruspe</a>. This document was read in the <a href="01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> of 534. It was in fact the custom in Africa that <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> should not of necessity be subject to the local <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but might choose any <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> at a distance as their <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior. Fulgentius now gave himself to the care of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He was careful that his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> should not wear fine clothes, nor devote themselves to secular occupations. They were to have houses near the church, to cultivate their gardens with their own hands, and to be particular about correct pronunciation and sweetness in singing the psalms. He corrected some with words, others with scourging. He ordered <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> on Wednesdays and Fridays for all <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="15617c.htm">widows</a>, and for those of the <a href="08748a.htm">laity</a> that were able. In this last period of <a href="06315a.htm">St. Fulgentius's</a> life he published some sermons, and ten books against the <a href="01707c.htm">Arian</a> Fabianus, of which only fragments remain. A year before his death he was moved to great compunction of heart; he suddenly quitted all his work, and even his <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and sailed with a few companions to the island of Circe, where he gave himself to reading, <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> in a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> which he had previously caused to be constructed on a small rock. There he mortified his members and wept in the <a href="12396a.htm">presence of God</a> alone, as though he anticipated a speedy death. But complaints were made of his absence, and he returned to his labors. He shortly fell into a grievous sickness. In his sufferings he said ceaselessly: "O Lord, give me patience here, and forgiveness hereafter." He refused, as too luxurious, the warm bath which the physicians recommended. He summoned his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and in the presence of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> asked pardon for any want of sympathy or any undue severity he might have shown. He was sick for seventy days, continuing in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and retaining all his faculties to the last. His possessions he gave to the <a href="12327a.htm">poor</a>, and to those of his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> who were in need. He died on 1 January, 533, in the sixty-fifth year of his life and the twenty-fifth of his episcopate.</p>

<p>Besides the works already mentioned, we still possess of <a href="06315a.htm">St. Fulgentius</a> some fine treatises, sermons, and letters. The best known is the book "De Fide", a description of the <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> Faith, written for a certain Peter, who was going on a <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> East. The three books "Ad Monimum", written in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, are addressed to a friend who understood <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> to teach that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="12378a.htm">predestinates</a> <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>. <a href="06315a.htm">St. Fulgentius</a> is saturated with <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> writings and way of thinking, and he defends him from the charge of making <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="12378a.htm">predestinate</a> <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>. He himself makes it a matter of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> that unbaptized infants are punished with <a href="07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> for <a href="11312a.htm">original sin</a>. No one can by any means be saved outside the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; all <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> are infallibly damned. "It is to think unworthily of grace, to suppose that it is given to all men", since not only not all have <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, but there are still some nations which the preaching of the Faith has not yet reached. These harsh doctrines seem to have suited the African temperament. His last work against Semipelagianism was written at <a href="13230c.htm">Ruspe</a> and addressed to the leaders of the Scythian <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, John and Venerius: "De veritate praedestinationis et gratiae Dei", in three books. To these we may add the two books, "De remissione peccatorum". He wrote much on the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> and the Incarnation: "Liber contra Arianos", "Liber ad Victorem", "Liber ad Scarilam de Incarnatione". To St. Augustine's <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity, Fulgentius adds a thorough grasp of the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Person of Christ as defined against <a href="10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> and <a href="05633a.htm">Eutychianism</a>. His thought is always <a href="09324a.htm">logical</a> and his exposition clear, and he is the principal <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the sixth century, if we do not count <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>. His letters have no biographical interest, but are <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises on chastity, virginity, penance, etc. His sermons are eloquent and full of fervour, but are few in number.</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The chief authority for the life of St. Fulgentius is the biography by a disciple, almost certainly FERRANDUS, the canonist; it is prefixed to his works, and is also in Acta SS., 1 Jan. See REYNOLDS in Dict. of Christ. Biog., who refers also to SCHROECKH, Kirchengeschichte, xvii, xviii, and WIGGERS, Augustinismus und Pelagianismus, II; there is an excellent summary of his works in FESSLER-JUNGMANN, Patrologia, II; WORTER, Zur Dogmengeschichte des Semipelagianismus, III (Munster, 1900); FICKER, Zur Wurdigung des Vita Fulgentii (Zeitschr. f. Kirchengesch., 1900, 9); HELM identifies St. Fulgentius with the grammarian Fabius Furius Fulgentius Planciades (Rhein. Mus. Philol., 1897, 177; Philologus, 1897, 253; see TEUFFEL-SCHWABE, Gesch. der rom. Lit., 5th ed., pp. 1238 sqq.) On the collection of 80 spurious sermons appended to St. Fulgentius's works (first publ. by Raynaldus, Lyons, 1652) see G. MORIN, Notes sur un MS. des homelies du Pseudo-Fulgence (in Revue Bened., April, 1909). The best edition of St. Fulgentius is that of DESPREZ (Paris, 1684), reprinted in Migne, P.L., LXV. Cf. BARDENHEWER, Patrology (tr., St. Louis, 1908).</p></div>
