<p>(MURI-GRIES)</p>

<p>An abbey of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Order of S. Benedict, which flourished for over eight centuries at Muri near Basle in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and which is now established under Austrian rule at Gries near Bozen in Tyrol.</p>

<p>The <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Martin at Muri in the Canton of Aargau, in the Diocese of Basle (but originally in that of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>), was founded in 1027 by the illustrious house of Hapsburg. Rha, a daughter of Frederick, Duke of Lorraine, who married Rabets, Count of Hapsburg, and Werner, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, with one accord gave the lands, which each possessed at Muri, to a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> which they established in that place. To people the new foundation a colony of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> was drawn from the Abbey of St. Meinrad at <a href="05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, under the leadership of Prior Reginbold, on whose death in 1055 the first <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> was chosen in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of Burchard. During his rule the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> church was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1064; it was for many years the burial place of the Hapsburg dynasty. About this time the community was reinforced by the accession of a new colony of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> from the Abbey of St. Blaise in the Black Forest, one of whom, the blessed Luitfrid, continued the government of both communities till his holy death 31 December, 1096. During the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, like so many hundreds of similar institutions of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, pursued its quiet work of religion and civilization, and enjoyed the advantage of being governed by a remarkable succession of the able men. Among the names of its more distinguished <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> are those of Ranzelin; Cuno, founder of its <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, and a generous benefactor to the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>; Henry Scheuk who greatly increased its landed <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>; and Henry de Schoenwerd. The history of the last named presents a curious instance, almost without parallel, of a whole <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> embracing the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>. The father with his sons entered the abbey of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, whilst his wife and daughters betook themselves to the adjoining <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>, a community which later on was transferred to Hermetschwil, a mile or two distant from Muri. The good reputation enjoyed by the Abbey of Muri procured it many friends. In 1114 the <a href="07232a.htm">Emperor Henry V</a> took it under his special protection; and the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> on their side were not less solicitous for its welfare; it would seem, however, that the use of <em>pontificalia</em> was not granted to the <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Muri until the time of <a href="08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> (1503-1513).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Like all other institutions the place had its vicissitudes of good and bad fortune. It was laid low by two disastrous conflagrations, in 1300 and in 1363; <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> and risings checked for a time its prosperity. It recovered somewhat of its old life under Abbot Conrad II, only to suffer again under his successor George Russinger in the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. Russinger had taken part in the <a href="04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> and had caught something of the reforming spirit of that assembly. He was the means of aggregating his community to the newly formed Congregation of Bursfeld, the first serious attempt to bring about among the continental <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of northern <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a> a sane and much needed reform of the Black Monks of St. Benedict. It was owing to him too that the Helvetic Confederation took over, as it were, the old Hapsburg friendliness towards his <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> which, thus strengthened both in its inner life and observance, and safe under the protection of the new political powers, was enabled to withstand the shock of the religious <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> and <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> upheavals which marked the advent of the <a href="12700b.htm">Protestant Reformation</a>. When the first fury of that movement had abated Muri was fortunate in having as <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> a man of remarkable ability. Dom John Jodoc Singisen elected in 1596 proved himself a second founder of his <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and extending his care to the other <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> houses of <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> is rightly revered as one of the founders of the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Congregation established in 1602. Largely through his efforts discipline was everywhere restored; <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and letters when forth from Muri to repeople the half-ruined <a href="04060a.htm">cloisters</a>; by his wisdom suitable constitutions were drawn up for such communities of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> as had survived so many revolutions. His successor Dom Dominic Tschudi was a man of like mould, and a scholar whose works were held in great repute. He was born at <a href="02194a.htm">Baden</a> in 1595 and died there in 1654. His "Origo et genealogia comitum do Hapsburg" is his best known work. With the eighteenth century fresh honours came to Muri. The Emperor Leopold I created Abbot Placid Zurlauben and his successors Princes of the Holy Roman Empire, and spent a vast sum of money in rebuilding and embellishing the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church, the ancient mausoleum of the imperial <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>. The <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> continued to prosper in every way; good discipline was kept up and many distinguished <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and learned men were <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> within its walls.</p>

<p>With the spread of revolutionary <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, however, a great and disastrous change was impending. Some of the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Cantons, Aagau among them, following the melancholy example of the revolutionary party which had wrecked religion in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, turned all their energies to the overthrow of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the confiscation of their estates, and the elimination of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> influence from civil life. They were only too successful. Muri after a long series of attacks was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to succumb. Its <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, an old man, had withdrawn to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="05429b.htm">Engelberg</a>, more favourably situated, and there died on 5 November, 1838, leaving to his successor, D. Adalbert Regli, the brunt of the final conflict. The crisis came when on a winter's day in 1841 an armed force drove the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> into exile and the cantonal authorities seized the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> and its estates. Despite this violent expulsion the community never wholly disbanded; the <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> and some of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> held together and soon found a welcome from the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Canton of Unterwalden, which invited them to undertake the management of the cantonal college at Sarnen. The kindly offer was accepted, and there the main body of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> resided, the Lord Abbot himself taking his share in the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> work, until the Austrian Emperor, Ferdinand I, offered them a residence at Gries near Bozen in Tyrol, in an old <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of <a href="03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> of the Lateran which had been unoccupied since 1807. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> concurred in the grant, and confirmed the transfer of the community of Muri to Gries by a <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, <a href="04636c.htm">dated</a> 16 September, 1844. In order to avoid complications the house of Gries was continued in its former status as a <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> and incorporated with the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Abbey of Muri, which is regarded as temporarily located in its Austrian dependency, the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Muri being at the same time Prior of Gries. The <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> which drove the community from its stately home at Muri seems in no way to have lessened the numbers and <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a> of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>; indeed there has been a notable increase in the personnel of the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in recent years and fresh demands are ever being made on their manifold activities. At Gries itself, the centre of this fraternity of nearly a hundred <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> (over seventy <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, the rest lay-brothers), who constitutes the monastic <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of St. Martin of Muri, the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> conduct a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of 158 boys, and also a training college for schoolmasters attended by nearly sixty students; while at Sarnen in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> their college <a href="05295b.htm">educates</a> about two hundred and forty boys, and at the technical <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in the same place, carried on by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, the classes number usually between seventy and eighty scholars. The <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Muri has under his care five "incorporated" <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> with two <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> of ease serving for the spiritual needs of about nine thousand <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>; another <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a>, not incorporated with the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, <a href="10326a.htm">ministers</a> to about 418 people; and the oversight of the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> long established at Hermetschwil-Habsthal near Muri is also included in the work of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Muri-Gries.</p>
