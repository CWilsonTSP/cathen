<p><a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>; b. 18 May, 1812, at Geismar, Province of Saxony; d. 16 July, 1879, at Mont St Guibert, near <a href="03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, <a href="02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. He studied at first under an elder brother who was a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, and later at the "gymnasium" at Heiligenstadt; he studied <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and Oriental languages for two years at <a href="10631a.htm">Munich</a> under <a href="05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> and <a href="11325a.htm">Allioli</a>, then went to Halle where the famous Gesenius taught, and thence to <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, where he passed the <em>examen rigorosum</em> for the degree of "Doctor Theologi&aelig;". But before he could present the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> Public Act, he was compelled to leave <a href="15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and undergo the same examination in M&uuml;nster, <a href="15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, because the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> ministry forbade studying at South German <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> and did not recognize their degrees. In 1835 he obtained in M&uuml;nster the degree of D.D., for his dissertation: "De Petri denegatione, qua inquiritur de huius criminis ethica natura et luculentioribus effectibus". Feeling an inclination towards academic teaching which the <a href="11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a> was unable to satisfy, he entered the <a href="04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>, and as a student of the <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1836. Immediately after this he was appointed <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> of the "pro-gymnasium" at Wipperf&uuml;rth, which had just been established, and published, in <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 1839, under the pseudonym Dr. Fridericus Lange, a sharp and forceful pamphlet against <a href="07276c.htm">Hermesianism</a>, written in classical Latin and entitled "Nov&aelig; annotationes ad Acta Hermesiana et Acta Romana, quas ad causam Hermesianam denuo illustrandam scripsit". The pamphlet created a sensation everywhere and caused the coadjutor Geissel of Cologne to appoint the young savant teacher of religion at the Marzellengymnasium at Cologne in the year 1840. In order to elevate the teaching of religion in the higher <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> and to infuse into it a deeper significance, he wrote his famous text- book of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion for high-schools, which appeared at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1843 in two volumes and went through fifteen editions. It was used as a text-book in all <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> gymnasia and translated into Hungarian and French, but later on, during the <a href="08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, it was suppressed by order of the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> minister of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Before the end of the same year he was invited by Bishop Dammers of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> to become professor of <a href="14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> in the faculty of his home diocese, but Geissel requested him to remain in <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a> and made him extraordinary professor of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a>, inspector of the local <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and, with <a href="04786c.htm">Dieringer</a>, <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> preacher. In 1848 he became ordinary professor of <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and published, in 1850, the "Lehrbuch der katholischen Moral" which as early as 1865 had gone through five editions. Dating back to his work as professor in Bonn, there exist numerous articles in the "katholischen Vierteljahrsschrift f&uuml;r Wissenschaft und Kunst" of which he was one of the founders, as well as in the "Kirchenlexikon"; there are furthermore an unfinished translation of the "Jewish History" of <a href="08522a.htm">Flavius Josephus</a>, a translation of the writings of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> on the Eucharist and the <a href="04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a>, an edition of <a href="09567a.htm">Maldonatus's</a> "Commentary on the Four Gospels" (1854 and 1862) and finally, "Die Wissenschaft von der g&ouml;ttlichen Dingen" a popular handbook of Dogma representing the ripe fruits of his long work upon the writings of <a href="14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (1855 and 1869). Soon, however, he was compelled to give up his work at <a href="02673b.htm">Bonn</a>.</p>

<p>In 1856 he was elected <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, and <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="06405a.htm">Cardinal Geissel</a> on 17 August. Filled with <a href="15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> he accepted the responsible office, and became one of the most illustrious <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; one who with his untiring labour and perseverance encouraged <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life in his extensive diocese, and who exerted a beneficent influence even far beyond his own domain, by his example and his writings. As a man of firm and unshakable <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> he considered it his chief <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to protect the Faith against all attacks. It was his first care to train effective <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. In order to accomplish this purpose, he combined his annual confirmation journeys with detailed investigations so as to become acquainted with his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to instill everywhere a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> spirit. He founded, in 1857, at Heiligenstadt a second <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys and introduced the general examination for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. In connection with <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a> he formed in 1860 during the provincial council at <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, he founded with his own money a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. He even had the satisfaction of holding a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod at <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> in 1867, the first for two centuries; at this synod the resolutions passed at the Council of Cologne were adopted, although in slightly changed form. In order to give more effect to these resolutions, he caused them to be published in the "Acta et Decreta synodi di&aelig;cesius Paderborniensis", 1867 (2nd edition, 1888). He acquired especial merit through the establishment and enlargement of the Bonifatius-Verein, of which he was president from 1859 until 1875, and through the assistance of which he was able to found about fifty new missionary posts in neglected districts. In two magnificent works, "The Chief Duty of Catholic Germany", and "Another Message to the Christian German People in Matters Regarding the Bonifatius-Verein" he explained its noble aims and made a powerful appeal for the manifesting of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> by giving assistance to poor <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches and <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>. Full of enthusiasm he even planned to lead the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> back to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and addressed to them three friendly brochures entitled: "An episcopal message to the Protestants of Germany, especially to those of my own Diocese, regarding the points of controversy between us" (Paderborn, 1866); "Second Episcopal Message to the Protestants of Germany" (same year); and "Why is there still this gulf between the Churches? An open message to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany's</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a>" (Paderborn, 1869). Naturally these writings did not have the success expected by him, but on the contrary made him many enemies; they stirred, however, many <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from their torpidity and strengthened them in their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> gave him the opportunity to show his fidelity to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and to champion his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. As a member of the "Congregatio dogmatica" and the "Commissio pro postulatis" he took a lively part in the discussions of the same, and was from the beginning a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> defendant of the <a href="07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> office; with him originated the wording of the most important chapter of the final decision. Soon after the new <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> had been formulated, and, in order to quiet nervous minds and to enlighten the <a href="05769a.htm">faithful</a>, he published several pastorals which passed far beyond the confines of his own diocese; as, for instance, "The Infallible Office of the Pope", (1870); and "A Pastoral Message: What the Vatican Council presents to us as Faith regarding the pope" (1871); and several more extensive works, in which he explains in detail the far-reaching consequences of the decision, as "The real meaning of the Vatican decision regarding the Infallible Papal Office" (Paderborn, 1871), the "Deliberations of the Vatican Council" (Paderborn, 1873), which was also translated into Italian, and "Omnium Concilii Vaticani, qu&aelig; ad doctrinam et disciplinam pertinent documentorum collectio" (Paderborn, 1873). This fidelity to the <a href="01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> which he showed openly at every opportunity despite all hostile criticisms; his restless activity for the spread of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>; the establishment of missions in Northern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and his open message to the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, formed the opportunity for the most vituperious attacks against him in the daily press and, as soon as the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> had been passed, a welcome occasion to proceed against him by means of different oppressive measures and a chance to undermine his authority; but in vain, for as soon as the intentions of the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government became clear to all, thousands of men from the whole diocese journeyed to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> town enthusiastically to swear undying fidelity to their <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Finally, in 1874, because of his transgression of the May Laws, he was sentenced to <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>; in the following year relieved of his office, by order of the Minister of Worship, and incarcerated in the fortress of Wesel. A few months later, however, he succeeded in escaping to <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a>, but was expelled on the demand of the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government. He found a refuge with the Sisters of Christian Love, who had been banished from <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> and who had settled in Mont St. Guibert. From there, as a centre, he governed secretly his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, laboured as <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and teacher of religion, and wrote several works, of which these are noteworthy: "Drei Jahre aus meinen Leben: 1874-1877" (Paderborn, 1877); "Zeitbilder oder Erinnerungen an meine verewigten Wohlt&#228;ter", (Mainz, 1879). Numerous other writings, mostly the fruit of lectures in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, in the mother house of the Sisters of Christian Love at <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> and in St. Guibert, we must leave unnoticed. Some have only been found among his papers after his death, and were published by his companion and private secretary, Stamm, in seven volumes, 1882-1890.</p>
