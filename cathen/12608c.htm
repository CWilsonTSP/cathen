<p>Quietism (<a href="09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>quies, quietus</em>, passivity) in the <strong>broadest sense</strong> is the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which declares that man's highest perfection consists in a sort of psychical self-annihilation and a consequent absorption of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> into the Divine Essence even during the present life. In the state of "quietude" the mind is wholly inactive; it no longer thinks or wills on its own account, but remains passive while <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> acts within it. Quietism is thus generally speaking a sort of <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> or exaggerated <a href="10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, which under the guise of the loftiest spirituality contains <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> notions which, if consistently followed, would prove fatal to morality. It is fostered by <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> and similar theories, and it involves peculiar notions concerning the Divine cooperation in <a href="01115a.htm">human acts</a>.</p>

<p>In a <strong>narrower sense</strong> Quietism designates the mystical element in the teaching of various <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a> which have sprung up within the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, only to be cast out as <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a>. In some of these the Quietistic teaching has been the conspicuous <a href="05525a.htm">error</a>, in others it has been a mere corollary of more fundamental <a href="05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Quietism finally, in the strictest acceptation of the term, is the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> put forth and defended in the seventeenth century by Molinos and Petrucci. Out of their teaching developed the less radical form known as Semiquietism, whose principle advocates were <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> and <a href="07092b.htm">Madame Guyon</a>. All these varieties of Quietism insist with more or less emphasis on interior passivity as the essential condition of perfection; and all have been proscribed in very explicit terms by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In its essential features Quietism is a characteristic of the <a href="12738a.htm">religions</a> of <a href="07722a.htm">India</a>. Both <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> <a href="02730a.htm">Brahmanism</a> and <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> aim at a sort of self-annihilation, a state of indifference in which the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> enjoys an imperturbable tranquillity. And the means of bringing this about is the recognition of one's identity with Brahma, the all-god, or, for the <a href="03028b.htm">Buddhist</a>, the quenching of desire and the consequent attainment of Nirvana, incompletely in the present life, but completely after death. Among the Greeks the Quietistic tendency is represented by the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoics</a>. Along with <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, which characterizes their theory of the world, they present in their <em>apatheia</em> an ideal which recalls the indifference aimed at by the Oriental mystics. The wise man is he who has become independent and free from all desire. According to some of the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, the sage may indulge in the lowest kind of sensuality, so far as the body is concerned, without incurring the least defilement of his <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. The Neoplatonists (q.v.) held that the One gives rise to the <em>Nous</em> or Intellect, this to the world-soul, and this again to individual <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. These, in consequence of their union with matter, have forgotten their Divine origin. Hence the fundamental principle of morality is the return of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> to its source. The supreme destiny of man and his highest <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists in rising to the contemplation of the One, not by thought but by <a href="05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> (<em>ekstasis</em>).</p>

<p>The origin of these Quietistic tendencies is not hard to discover. However strongly the <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> conception of the world may appeal to the philosophic minded, it cannot do away with the obvious data of experience. To say that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> is part of the Divine being or an emanation from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> enhances, apparently, the dignity of man; but there still remains the fact that passion, desire, and moral <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> make <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="09238c.htm">life</a> anything but Divine. Hence the craving for deliverance and peace which can be obtained only by some sort of withdrawal from action and from dependence on external things and by a consequent immersion, more or less complete, in the Divine being. These aberrations of Mysticism continued even after the preaching of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had revealed to <a href="09580c.htm">mankind</a> the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, the moral order, and human destiny. <a href="06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, especially the <a href="01564b.htm">Antinomian School</a>, looked for <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> in a sort of <a href="08082b.htm">intuitive</a> <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Divine which emancipated the "spiritual" from the <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the moral law. The same Quietistic tendency appears in the teaching of the Euchites or <a href="10212a.htm">Messalians</a>, who maintained that <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> frees the body from passion and the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> inclination, so that <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and penitential works are useless. They were condemned at the Synod of Side in Pamphilia (383) and at Ephesus (431). The Bogomili of the later <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> were probably their lineal descendants.</p>

<p><a href="10285c.htm">Medieval</a> Quietism is further represented in the vagaries of <a href="07301a.htm">Hesychasm</a>, according to which the supreme aim of life on earth is the contemplation of the uncreated light whereby man is intimately united with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. The means for attaining to such contemplation are <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, complete repose of body and will, and a process of auto-suggestion. Among the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="02389c.htm">Beguines</a> and <a href="02389c.htm">Beghards</a> condemned by the Council of Vienne (1311-12) are the propositions: that man in the present life can attain such a degree of perfection as to become utterly impeccable; that the "perfect" have no need to fast or <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a>, but may freely grant the body whatsoever it craves; that they are not subject to any human authority or bound by the <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 471 sqq.). Similar exaggerations on the part of the Fraticelli led to their condemnation by <a href="08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in 1317 (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 484 sqq.). The same <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1329 proscribed among the <a href="05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="05274a.htm">Meister Eckhart</a> the assertions that (prop. 10) we are totally transformed into <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> just as in the sacrament the bread is changed into the Body of Christ; that (14) since <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> wills that I should have <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a> I do not wish that I had not <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a>; that (18) we should bring forth the fruit, not of external actions, which do not make us good, but of internal actions which are wrought by the Father abiding within us (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 501, sqq).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Quite in accord with their <a href="11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> principles, the Brethren and Sisters of the Free Spirit (thirteenth to fifteenth century) held that they who have reached perfection, i.e. complete absorption in <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, have no need of external worship, of <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, or of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>; they owe no obedience to any law, since their will is identical with <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> will; and they may indulge their carnal desires to any extent without staining the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>. This is also substantially the teaching of the <a href="16046a.htm">Illuminati (Alumbrados)</a>, a <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> that disturbed <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>It was the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> <a href="10441a.htm">Michael de Molinos</a> who developed Quietism in the strictest sense of the term. From his writings, especially from his "Dux spiritualis" (Rome, 1675), sixty-eight propositions were extracted and condemned by <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in 1687 (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 1221 sqq.). The key-note of the system is contained in the first proposition: man must annihilate his powers and this is the inward way (<em>via interna</em>); in fact, the desire to do anything actively is offensive to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and hence one must abandon oneself entirely to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and thereafter remain as a lifeless body (prop. 2). By doing nothing the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> annihilates itself and returns to its source, the essence of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, in which it is transformed and divinized, and then <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> abides in it (5). In this inward way, the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> has not to think either of reward or of punishment, of <a href="07170a.htm">heaven</a> or <a href="07207a.htm">hell</a>, of death or <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a>. It must not concern itself about its own state, its defects, or its progress in virtue; having once resigned its will to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> it must let Him work out His will without any action of the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> itself (7-13). He who has thus committed himself entirely to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> must not ask anything of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, or render thanks to Him; must take no account of <a href="14504a.htm">temptations</a> nor offer any active resistance; "and if nature be stirred one must permit its stirring because it is nature" (14-17). In <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> one must not use images or discursive thought, but must remain in "obscure <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>" and in quiet, forgetting every distinct thought of the <a href="02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>, abiding in <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> presence to adore, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> and serve Him, but without producing any acts because with these <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is not pleased. Whatever thoughts arise during <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, even though they be impure or against <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, if they are not <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> encouraged nor <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> expelled but are suffered with indifference and resignation, do not hinder the <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> but rather enhance its perfection. He who desires sensible devotion is seeking not <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> but himself; indeed every sensible effect experienced in the spiritual life is abominable, filthy, unclean (18-20).</p>

<p>No preparation is required before Communion nor thanksgiving after other than that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> remain in its usual state of passive resignation; and the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> must not endeavour to arouse in itself feelings of devotion. Interior <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> resign themselves, in silence, to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; and the more thorough their resignation the more do they realize that they are unable to recite even the "Pater Noster". They should elicit no acts of <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for the Blessed Virgin or the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> or the Humanity of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because, as these are all sensible objects, <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> for them is also sensible. External works are not <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to sanctification, and penitential works, i.e. <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="10578b.htm">mortification</a> should be cast off as a grievous and useless burden (32-40). <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> permits the <a href="04710a.htm">demon</a> to use "violence" with certain perfect <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> even to the point of making them perform carnal actions either alone or with other <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a>. When these onsets occur, one must make no effort but let the <a href="04710a.htm">demon</a> have his way. Scruples and <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> must be set aside. In particular, these things are not to be mentioned in confession, because by not confessing them the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> overcomes the <a href="04710a.htm">demon</a>, acquires a "treasure of peace", and attains to closer union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> (41-52). The "inward way" has nothing to do with confession, confessors, cases of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or philosophy. Indeed, <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> sometimes makes it impossible for <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> who are advanced in perfection to go to confession, and supplies them with as much grace as they would receive in the <a href="11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. The inward way leads on to a state in which passion is extinguished, <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is no more, sense is deadened, and the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, willing only what <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> wills, enjoys an imperturbable peace: this is the mystic death. They who pursue this path must obey their superiors outwardly; even the <a href="15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience taken by religious extends only to outward actions, only <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> and the director enter into the <a href="14153a.htm">soul's</a> interior. To say that the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> in its interior life should be governed by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> is a new and very ridiculous <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>; for on the hidden things the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> passes no judgment (55-68).</p>

<p>From this summary it is readily seen why the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> condemned Quietism. Nevertheless, these doctrines had found adherents even in the higher ranks of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, such as the Oratorian, Pietro Matteo Petrucci (1636-1701), who was made <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="08372a.htm">Jesi</a> (1681), and raised to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> (1686). His works on Mysticism and the spiritual life were criticized by the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Paolo Segneri, and a controversy ensued which resulted in an examination of the whole question by the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and the proscription of fifty-four propositions taken from eight of Petrucci's writings (1688). He submitted at once, resigned his <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 1696, and was appointed by <a href="08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> <a href="15483a.htm">Apostolic visitor</a>. Other leaders of the Quietist movement were: Joseph Beccarelli of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who retracted before the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> at <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1710; Fran&ccedil;ois Malaval, a blind <a href="08748a.htm">layman</a> of <a href="09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> (1627-1719); and especially the <a href="02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> Fran&ccedil;ois Lacombe, the director of <a href="07092b.htm">Mme. Guyon</a>, whose views were embraced by <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> contained in <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon's</a> "Explication de Maximes des Saints" was suggested by the teachings of Molinos, but was less extreme in its principles and less dangerous in its application; it is usually designated as Semiquietism. The controversy between <a href="02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> has already been noticed. The latter submitted his book to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for examination, with the result that twenty-three propositions extracted from it were condemned by <a href="08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> in 1699 (<a href="04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 1327 sqq.). According to <a href="06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, there is an habitual state of the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> which is wholly pure and disinterested, without fear of punishment or desire of reward. In this state the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> loves <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> for His own sake &#151; not to gain merit, perfection, or <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> by loving Him; this is the contemplative or unitive life (props. 1, 2). In the state of holy indifference, the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> has no longer any <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> deliberate desire in its own behalf except on those occasions in which it does not faithfully cooperate with all the grace vouchsafed to it. In that state we seek nothing for ourselves, all for <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>; we desire <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not as our deliverance or reward or supreme interest, but simply as something that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> is pleased to will and that He would have us desire for His sake (4-6). The self-abandonment which Christ in the Gospel requires of us is simply the renunciation of our own interest, and the extreme trials that demand the exercise of this renunciation are <a href="14504a.htm">temptations</a> whereby <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> would purify our <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, without holding out to us any hope even in regard to our eternal welfare. In such trials the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, by a reflex conviction that does not reach its innermost depths, may have the invincible persuasion that it is justly reprobated by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. In this involuntary despair it accomplishes the absolute sacrifice of its own interest in regard to <a href="05551b.htm">eternity</a> and loses all interested hope; but in its higher and most inward acts it never loses perfect hope which is the disinterested desire of obtaining the Divine promises (7-12). While meditation consists in discursive acts, there is a state of contemplation so sublime and perfect that it becomes habitual, i.e. whenever the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="12345b.htm">prays</a>, its <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> is contemplative, not discursive, and it needs not to return to methodical meditation (15-16). In the passive state the <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> exercises all the virtues without adverting to the fact that they are virtues; its only thought is to do what <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> wills; it desires even <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>, not as its own perfection and <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but simply in so far as <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> is what <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> asks of us (18-19). In confession the transformed <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> should detest its <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> and seek forgiveness not as its own purification and deliverance but as something that <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> wills and that He would have us will for His glory (20). Though this <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of pure <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> is the <a href="11665b.htm">evangelical perfection</a> recognized in the whole course of tradition, the earlier directors of <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a> exhorted the multitude of the just only to practices of interested <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> proportioned to the <a href="06689a.htm">graces</a> bestowed on them. Pure <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> alone constitutes the whole interior life and is the one principle and motive of all actions that are deliberate and meritorious (22-23).</p>

<p>While these condemnations showed the determined attitude of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> against Quietism both in its extreme and in its moderate form, <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> contained certain elements which the Quietist might have consistently adopted. The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, i.e. without <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, accorded very well with Quietistic passivity. In the "invisible Church" as proposed by the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, the Quietist would have found a congenial refuge from the control of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. And the attempt to make the religous life an affair of the individual <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> in its direct dealings with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> was no less <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> than it was Quietistic. In particular, the rejection, in part or in whole, of the sacramental system, would lead the devout <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> to a Quietist attitude. As a matter of fact, traces of Quietism are found in early Methodism and <a href="06304b.htm">Quakerism</a> (the "inward light"). But in its later developments <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> has come to lay emphasis on the active, rather than the inert, contemplative life. Whereas <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> maintained that <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> without work suffices for <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>, his successors at the present day attach little importance to dogmatic <a href="02408b.htm">belief</a>, but insist much on "religion as a life", i.e. as action. The <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> avoids such extremes. The <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> indeed, assisted by <a href="06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> can reach a high degree of contemplation, of detachment from created things and of spiritual union with <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. But such perfection, far from leading to Quietistic passivity and Subjectivism, implies rather a more earnest endeavour to labour for <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> glory, a more thorough obedience to lawful authority and above all a more complete subjugation of sensuous impulse and tendency.</p>
