<p><a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="10304b.htm">Milevis</a>, in Numidia, in the fourth century. He was a convert, as we gather from <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>: "Do we not see with how great a booty of gold and silver and garments <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <em>doctor suavissimus</em>, came forth out of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and likewise Lactantius, Victorinus, Optatus, Hilary?" (De Doctrina Christ., xl). Optatus probably had been a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> rhetorician. His work against the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> is an answer to Parmenian, the successor of Donatus in the See of Carthage. <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 110</a>) tells us it was in six books and was written under <a href="15253b.htm">Valens</a> and Valentinian (364-75). We now possess seven books, and the list of <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> is carried as far as Siricius (384-98). Similarly the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> succession of <a href="01582a.htm">antipopes</a> is given (II, iv), as Victor, Bonifatius, Encolpius, Macrobius, Lucianus, Claudianus (the <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> of the last is about 380), though a few sentences earlier Macrobius is mentioned as the actual <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The plan of the work is laid down in Book I, and is completed in six books. It seems, then, that the seventh book, which <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> did not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> in 392, was an appendix to a new edition in which St. Optatus made additions to the two episcopal lists. The date of the original work is fixed by the statement in I, xiii, that sixty years and more had passed since the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (303-5). Photinus (d. 376) is apparently regarded as still alive; <a href="08558b.htm">Julian</a> is dead (363). Thus the first books were published about 366-70, and the second edition about 385-90.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>St. Optatus deals with the entire controversy between <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> (see <a href="05121a.htm">DONATISTS</a>). He distinguishes between schismatics and <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The former have rejected unity, but the have <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, hence Parmenian should not have threatened then (and consequently his own party) with <a href="07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. This mild <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is a great contrast to the severity of many of the Fathers against <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. It seems to be motived by the notion that all who have <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> will be saved, though after long torments,--a view which <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> has frequently to combat. <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were agreed as to the <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>. The question was, where is this One Church? Optatus argues that it cannot be only in a corner of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>; it must be the <em>catholica</em> (the word is used as a substantive) which is throughout the world. Parmenian had enumerated six <em>dotes</em>, or properties, of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which Optatus accepts five, and argues that the first, the episcopal chair, <em>cathedra</em>, belongs to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and therefore they have all the others. The whole <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> has arisen through the quarrel as to the episcopal succession at <a href="03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and it might have been expected that Optatus would claim this <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> of <em>cathedra</em> by pointing out the legitimacy of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> succession at Carthage. But he does not. He replies: "We must examine who sat first in the chair, and where. . . .You cannot deny that you <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that in the city of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> upon Peter first the chair of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> was conferred, in which sat the head of all the Apostles, Peter, whence also he was called Cephas, in which one chair unity should be preserved by all, lest the other Apostles should each stand up for his own chair, so that now he should be a <a href="13529a.htm">schismatic</a> and a sinner who should against this one chair set up another. Therefore in the one chair, which is the first of the <em>dotes</em> Peter first sat, to whom succeeded <a href="09272b.htm">Linus</a>." An incorrect list of <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> follows, ending with, "and to Damasus Siricius, who is today our colleague, with whom the whole world with us agrees by the communication of commendatory letters in the fellowship of one communion. Tell us the origin of your chair, you who wish to claim the holy Church for yourselves". Optatus then mocks at the recent succession of <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="01582a.htm">antipopes</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<p>Optatus argues, especially in book V, against the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> had inherited from <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> that <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> by those outside the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot be valid, and he anticipates <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> argument that the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> of the baptizer does not matter, since it is <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> who confers the grace. His statement of the objective efficacy of the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> <em>ex opere operato</em> is well known: "Sacramenta per se esse sancta, non per homines" (V, iv). Thus in <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> there must be the <a href="15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, the believer and the minister, and there importance is in this order, the third being the least important. In rebuking the sacrileges of the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, he says: "What is so profane as to break, scrape, remove the altars of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, on which you yourselves had once offered, on which both the <a href="12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the people and the members of Christ have been borne, where <a href="06608a.htm">God Almighty</a> has been invoked, where the <a href="07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has been asked for and has come down, from which by many has been received the pledge of <a href="05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a> and the safeguard of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and the hope of <a href="12792a.htm">resurrection</a>? . . . For what is an altar but the seat of the Body and Blood of Christ?" In book VII a notable argument for unity is added: St. Peter <a href="14004b.htm">sinned</a> most grievously and denied his Master, yet he retained the keys, and for the sake of unity and charity the Apostles did not separate from his fellowship. Thus Optatus defends the willingness of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to receive back the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> to unity without difficulty, for there must be always sinners in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the cockle is mixed with the wheat; but charity covers a multitude of <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The style of St. Optatus is vigorous and animated. He aims as terseness and effect, rather than at flowing periods, and this in spite of the gentleness and charity which is so admirable in his polemics against his "brethren", as he insists on calling the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He uses <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> a great deal, though he refutes that saint's mistaken opinion about <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and does not copy his easy style. His descriptions of events are admirable and vivid. It is strange that Dupin should have called him <em>minus nitidus ac politus</em>, for both in the words he employs and in their order he almost incurs the blame of preciosity. His is as strict as <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> as to the metrical cadences at the close of every sentence. He was evidently a man of good taste as well as of high culture, and he has left us in his one work a monument of convincing dialectic, of elegant literary form, and of <a href="03592a.htm">Christian charity</a>. But the general marshalling of his arguments is not so good as is the development of each by itself. His allegorical interpretations are far-fetched, but those of Parmenian were evidently yet more extravagant. An appendix contained an important dossier of documents which had apparently been collected by some <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversialist between 330 and 347 (see <a href="05121a.htm">DONATISTS</a>). This collection was already mutilated when it was copied by the scribe of the only <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> which has preserved it, and that <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is incomplete, so that we can have to deplore the loss of a great part this first-rate material for the early history of <a href="05121a.htm">Donatism</a>. We can tell what has been lost by the citations made by Optatus himself and by Augustine.</p>

<p>St. Optatus has apparently never received any <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cultus; but his name was inserted in the Roman Martyrology on the fourth of June, though it is quite unknown to all the ancient Martyrologies and <a href="03158a.htm">calendars</a>. The <em>editio princeps</em> was by Cochl&aelig;us (Mainz, 1549). More <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were used by Balduinus (Paris, 1563 and 1569), whose text was frequently reprinted in the seventeenth century. Dupin's edition includes a history of the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and a geography of Africa (Paris 1700--); it is reprinted in <a href="06349c.htm">Gallandi</a> and in <a href="10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.L., XI). The best edition is that of Ziwza (C.S.E.L., XXVI, Vienna, 1893), with description of the <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.</p>
