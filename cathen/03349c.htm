<p>Under the Merovingian Kings there was established at the court a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> &#151; <em>scola palatina</em>, the chroniclers of the eighth century styled it &#151; for the training of the young <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> nobles in the art of <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and in the ceremonies of the court. This was not, however, a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in the modern acceptation of the term. Whatever <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> there was of the literary kind at that time was imparted at the monastic and <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. With the accession of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (768) a scheme of <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> reform was inaugurated, first in the palace <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> itself, and later in the various <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> established or reformed by imperial decrees throughout the vast empire over which <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> reigned. The reform of the palace <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, the change, namely, from a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of military tactics and court manners to a place of learning, was begun in 780, as soon as the victories over the Lombards, Saxons, and <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> afforded. It was not, however, until the arrival of <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a> in 782 that the work of <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> reform began to have any measure of success. <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> was not only placed at the head of the emperor's <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> in the palace, but was admitted to the council of the emperor in all <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> matters and became <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> "prime minister of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>". He represented the learning of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of York, which united in its traditions the current of <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> reform inaugurated in the South of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> by Theodore of <a href="14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and that other current which, starting from the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, spread over the entire northern part of <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. He was not, indeed, an original thinker. Nevertheless, he exerted a profound cultural influence on the whole <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom by reason of the high esteem in which <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and his courtiers held him. He taught grammar, rhetoric, dialectic and the elements of geometry, <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and music (see SEVEN LIBERAL ARTS). And his success as a teacher of these branches seems to have been generally acknowledged by all the courtiers as well as by his royal patron. We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> from Einhard's biography of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> that the emperor, the princes and the princesses, and all the royal household formed a kind of higher <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at the palace in order to learn from <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> what would nowadays be considered the merest rudiments.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p><a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> was not content with securing for his palace <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> the services of the ablest teacher of that age. Acting under <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> advice he proceeded by a series of enactments <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from 787 (two years after the final triumph over the Saxons) to 789, to inaugurate a reform in the <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> conditions throughout the empire. In 787 he issued the famous capitulary which has been styled the "Charter of Modern Thought". In it he addresses himself to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the empire, informing them that he "has judged it to be of utility that, in their <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> committed by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ's</a> favour to his charge, care should be taken that there should not only be a regular manner of life, but also the study of letters, each to teach and learn them according to his ability and the Divine assistance". He has observed, he says, in the letters which, during past years, he has received from different <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, that though the thoughts contained therein are most just, the language in which those thoughts are expressed is often uncouth, and the fear arises in his mind lest if the skill to write correctly were thus lacking, the power of rightly comprehending the Scriptures might be less than it should be. "Let there, therefore, be chosen [for the work of teaching] men who are both willing and able to learn and let them apply themselves to this work with a <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> equal to the earnestness with which we recommend it to them". Copies of this letter are to be sent to all suffragan <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and to all (dependent) <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In the great council held at <a href="01001a.htm">Aachen</a> (789) he issued more explicit instructions regarding the <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>. From the wording of the capitulary of 787, it is clear that <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> intended to introduce the reform of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> into all the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of the empire.</p>

<p>Again in the capitulary of 789 we read: "Let every <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and every <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> have its <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, in which boys may be taught the Psalms, the system of musical notation, singing, arithmetic and grammar". There can be no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> that by boys are meant not only the candidates for the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and the wards (generally the children of nobles) committed to the care of the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, but also the children of the village or country district around the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, for whom there was usually an external <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> attached to groups of monastic buildings. This is made evident by an enactment of Theodulf, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, who, when <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> retired to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a> in 796, succeeded him at the Court as adviser of the emperor in <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> matters. The document dates from 797, ten years after <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> first capitulary was issued, and enacts explicitly "that the <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> establish <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> in every town and village, and if any of the faithful wish to entrust their children to them to learn letters, that they refuse not to accept them but with all charity teach them . . . and let them exact no price from the children for their teaching nor receive anything from them save what <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> may offer <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> and from affection" (P.L., CV., col. 196). To <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> himself tradition has assigned the lines set up in the streets of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> in which the attractions of a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> are compared with those of a nearby tavern: "Choose, O traveller; if thou wilt drink thou must also pay money, but if thou wilt learn thou wilt have what thou seekest for nothing." In these free <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> the teacher was, apparently, the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of the town or village, and, as far as we can judge, the curriculum composed what may be called the rudiments of general <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, with an elementary course in <a href="05075b.htm">Christian Doctrine</a>.</p>

<p>The "new learning" inaugurated at the palace <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, which seems to have had no fixed location, but to have followed the court from place to place, was not slow in spreading throughout the empire. Its first noticeable success was at <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, which since the days of its first <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Sturm, had maintained a tradition of fidelity to the ideals of St. Benedict. The man to whose enlightened <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> the success of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> was largely due was <a href="12617a.htm">Rhabanus Maurus</a>. While still a young <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, Rhabanus, learning of the fame of <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, begged to be sent to <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>, where, for a year, he listened to the aged teacher, and imbibed some of his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the study of the classics and the cultivation of the <a href="13598b.htm">sciences</a>. On his return to <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> he was placed at the head of the <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> and, amid many difficulties, continued to labour for the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> reform of his own <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and his own land. What these difficulties were we may judge from the treatment which he received at the hands of his <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Ratgar, who, <a href="02408b.htm">believing</a> that the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were better employed in building churches than in studying their lessons, closed the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and confiscated the teacher's note-books. Rhabanus' unpleasant experiences on this occasion are reflected by his saying "He alone escapes <a href="03190c.htm">calumny</a> who writes nothing at all." He was not, however, discouraged, and the day finally came when, as <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, he could give full authority to his measures for <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> reform. Later, as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, he continued to sustain the programme of the Carolingian revival, and by his efforts for the improvement of popular preaching, and by his advocacy of the use of the vernacular tongue, earned the title of the "Teacher of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>". His influence, indeed, may be traced beyond the territory which belonged to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>; to him and to his <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> activity is due the revival of learning in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of Solenhofen, Celle, Hirsfeld, Petersburg and Hirschau. Even <a href="12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> and St. Gall owe much to him, and it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that who, like Otfried of "Der Krist", first the Old High German an instrument of literary expression.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, the Carolingian revival was, as has been said, taken up by Theodulf, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, who, both by his own <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> enactments and by the advice which he gave the emperor, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> his right to the title of <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> successor. <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, himself, after his retirement to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="15002a.htm">Tours</a>, devoted his attention almost exclusively to monastic <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> and the transcription of <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works. Whatever <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> he had for the classics changed towards the end of his life into a deep-seated suspicion of all "pagan literature." In this he offers a striking contrast, with <a href="09436b.htm">Lupus Servatus</a>, a disciple of Rhabanus, who, as <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ferri&egrave;res, early in the ninth century encouraged and promoted the study of the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> classics with all the ardour of a fifteenth century Humanist. Through the influence of <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> Theodulf, <a href="09436b.htm">Lupus</a> and others, the Carolingian revival spread to <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, Auxerre, Laon, and Chartres, where even before the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a> had come into prominence, the foundations of <a href="13548a.htm">scholastic theology and philosophy</a> were laid. In Southern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> the Carolingian revival was felt before the close of the eighth century in Rheinau, <a href="12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>, and St. Gall, and early in the following century in Northern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, especially in <a href="11592b.htm">Pavia</a> and <a href="02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>. Under the successors of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> there sprang up the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and St. Laurent in the Low Countries which continued the movement.</p>

<p>With the extension and promotion of the Carolingian revival of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> are associated the names of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> teachers who were <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> rivals and who are certainly entitled to a share in the credit of having been the first masters of the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. According to the St. Gall chronicler who wrote the history of Charles the Great, two <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> arrived in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> before <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> had received <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> invitation, and having made known somewhat boastfully their desire to teach wisdom, were received by the emperor with <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, and one of them placed at the head of the palace <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. The story, however, is not accepted as reliable. We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> for certain that after <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> left the court of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, Clement the Irishman succeeded him as master of the palace <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, and that he had pupils sent to him even from the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. The grammarian, Cruindmelus, the poet Dungal, and Bishop <a href="05129a.htm">Donatus of Fiesole</a> were among the many <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> teachers on the Continent who enjoyed the favour of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. Indeed, the emperor, according to Einhard, "loved the strangers" and "had the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> in special esteem". His successors, likewise, invited the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> teachers to their court. Louis the Pious was the patron of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> geographer <a href="04778c.htm">Dicuil</a>, Lothair II stood in a similar relation to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> poet and Scribe Sedulius, founder of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and Charles the Bald equalled his grandfather in his affectionate esteem for the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> teachers. Under him Elias taught at Laon, Dunchad at <a href="12725a.htm">Reims</a>, Israel at Auxerre, and, the greatest of all the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholars, John Scotus Eriugena, was head of the palace <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>. Naturally the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> teachers flocked to the places already known to them by the missionary activity of their fellow-countrymen of former generations We find them at <a href="12723a.htm">Reichenau</a>, St. Gall, and Bobbio, "a whole herd of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophers</a>" as a ninth century writer expresses it. Every <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> or <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at-which they appeared soon showed the effect of their influence. To the curriculum already in vogue in the Carolingian Schools the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> teachers added the study of Greek, and wherever they taught <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a> (dialectic and the interpretation of the Scriptures) they drew largely from the writings of the <a href="10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a> and from the works of the <a href="05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers</a>.</p>

<p>With regard to the details of schoolwork in the institutions founded or reformed by <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, the chronicles of the time do not furnish us as much information as one would desire. We <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> that the course of studies in the town and village <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> (<em>per villas et viocos</em>) comprised at least the elements of <a href="05075b.htm">Christian Doctrine</a>, <a href="12144a.htm">plainsong</a>, the rudiments of grammar, and perhaps, where the influence of <a href="02436a.htm">St. Benedict's rule</a> was still felt, some kind of manual training. In the monastic and <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> the curriculum included grammar (corresponding to what we now call language-work in general, as well as the study of poetry), rhetoric, dialectic, geometry, arithmetic, music and <a href="02025a.htm">astronomy</a>. The text-book in these subjects was, wherever the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> teaching prevailed, Martianus Capella, "De Nuptiis Mercurii et philologiae"; elsewhere, as in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> taught by <a href="01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, the teacher compiled treatises on grammar, etc. from the works of <a href="03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, <a href="08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>, and <a href="02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a>. In some instances the works of <a href="02610b.htm">Boethius</a> were used as texts in dialectic. The master, <em>scholasticus</em> or <em>archischolus</em> (earlier <em>capiscola</em>), had at his command, besides his assistants, a <em>proscholus</em>, or prefect of discipline, whose <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> it was (in the <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, at least) to teach the children "how to walk, how to bow to strangers, how to behave in the presence of superiors". The teacher read (<em>legere</em> was synonymous with <em>docere</em>) while the pupils took down his dictation in their wax-tablets. The "school-room" was, until as late as the twelfth century the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and, in the case of some very popular teachers, the street or a public square. The floor of the schoolroom was strewn with straw on which the pupils sat &#151; boarded floors and benches do not appear to have been in use in <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> until the fifteenth century, although seats of a certain kind were provided at Cluny, in the twelfth century, namely, wooden boxes which served the double purpose of a seat and a repository for writing materials. Discipline in the Carolingian schools was maintained by the <em>proscholus</em>, and that the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> scholar dreaded the rod is clear from an episode in the history of the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Gall where, in order to escape a birching, the boys set fire to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Regulations regarding neatness, the hours to be given to work, and provision for the mid-day siesta, etc. show that some attention was paid to the health and comfort of the pupils. After the death of <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and the dismemberment of the empire, the <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> reforms introduced by him received a setback. There was a brief period under Charles the Bald, when royal favour was once more bestowed on scholars. But with the advent of the tenth century came other cares and occupations for the royal mind. Nevertheless, the monastic and episcopal <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, and no doubt the village <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> too, continued wherever <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and pillage did not render their existence impossible. Thus the <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> influence of the Carolingian revival of learning was continued in some way down to the dawn of the era of <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in the thirteenth century.</p>
