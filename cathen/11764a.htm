<p>(Or Damiani).</p>

<p><a href="05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>, <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, b. at <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> "five years after the death of the <a href="11356a.htm">Emperor Otto III</a>," 1007; d. at <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, 21 Feb., 1072.</p>

<p>He was the youngest of a large <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>; his <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a> were noble, but poor. At his birth an elder brother protested against this new charge on the resources of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> with such effect that his mother refused to suckle him and the babe nearly died. A <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> retainer, however, fed the starving child and by example and reproaches recalled his mother to her <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>. Left an <a href="11322b.htm">orphan</a> in early years, he was at first adopted by an elder brother, who ill-treated and under-fed him while employing him as a swineherd. The child showed signs of great <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a> and of remarkable <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> gifts, and after some years of this servitude another brother, who was <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> at <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, had pity on him and took him away to be <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a>. This brother was called Damian and it was generally accepted that St. Peter added this name to his own in grateful recognition of his brother's kindness. He made rapid progress in his studies, first at <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, then at <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, finally at the University of <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and when about twenty-five years old was already a famous teacher at <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. But, though even then much given to <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> and to other <a href="10578b.htm">mortifications</a>, he could not endure the <a href="13506d.htm">scandals</a> and distractions of <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> life and decided (about 1035) to retire from the world. While meditating on his resolution he encountered two <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> of <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a>, was charmed with their spirituality and detachment, and desired to join them. Encouraged by them Peter, after a forty days' retreat in a small cell, left his friends secretly and made his way to the hermitage of <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a>. Here he was received, and, to his surprise, clothed at once with the monastic habit.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Both as <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> and as professed religious his fervour was remarkable and led him to such extremes of penance that, for a time, his health was affected. He occupied his convalescence with a thorough study of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Scripture</a> and, on his recovery, was appointed to lecture to his fellow-monks. At the request of Guy of Pomposa and other heads of neighbouring <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, for two or three years he lectured to their subjects also, and (about 1042) wrote the life of <a href="13179b.htm">St. Romuald</a> for the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Pietrapertosa. Soon after his return to <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a> he was appointed economus of the house by the prior, who also pointed him out as his successor. This, in fact, he became in 1043, and he remained <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a> till his death. His priorate was characterized by a wise moderation of the rule, as well as by the foundation of subject-hermitages at <a href="13452a.htm">San Severino</a>, Gamugno, Acerata, Murciana, San Salvatore, Sitria, and Ocri. It was remarkable, too, for the introduction of the regular use of the discipline, a penitential exercise which he induced the great abbey of <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> to imitate. There was much opposition outside his own circle to this practice, but Peter's persistent advocacy ensured its acceptance to such an extent that he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> later to moderate the imprudent <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> of some of his own <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a>. Another innovation was that of the daily siesta, to make up for the fatigue of the night office. During his tenure of the priorate a <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a> was built, silver <a href="03561a.htm">chalices</a> and a silver processional cross were purchased, and many books added to the <a href="09227b.htm">library</a>. (See <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a>.)</p>

<p>Although living in the seclusion of the <a href="04060a.htm">cloister</a>, Peter Damian watched closely the fortunes of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, and like his friend Hildebrand, the future <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, he strove for her purification in those deplorable times. In 1045 when <a href="02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> resigned the supreme pontificate into the hands of the <a href="01697b.htm">archpriest</a> John Gratian (<a href="06791a.htm">Gregory VI</a>), Peter hailed the change with <a href="07131b.htm">joy</a> and wrote to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, urging him to deal with the <a href="13506d.htm">scandals</a> of the church in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, especially with the <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>, of <a href="03793c.htm">Citt&agrave; di Castello</a>, and of <a href="05785a.htm">Fano</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="02429a.htm">BENEDICT IX</a>; <a href="06791a.htm">GREGORY VI</a>.) He was present in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> when <a href="04017a.htm">Clement II</a> <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> Henry III and his wife Agnes, and he also attended a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> held at the Lateran in the first days of 1047, in which decrees were passed against <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>. After this he returned to his hermitage (see <a href="04017a.htm">CLEMENT II</a>; DAMASUS II). <a href="09160c.htm">Pope St. Leo IX</a> was <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="05479c.htm">enthroned</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 12 Feb., 1049, to <a href="01641a.htm">succeed</a> <a href="04613a.htm">Damasus II</a>, and about two years later Peter published his terrible treatise on the vices of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the "Liber Gomorrhianus", dedicating it to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. It caused a great stir and aroused not a little enmity against its author. Even the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, who had at first praised the work, was persuaded that it was exaggerated and his coldness drew from Damian a vigorous letter of protest. Meanwhile the question arose as to the validity of the ordinations of <a href="14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a> was appealed to and wrote (about 1053) a treatise, the "Liber Gratissimus", in favour of their validity, a work which, though much combatted at the time, was potent in deciding the question in their favour before the end of the twelfth century. In June, 1055, during the pontificate of Victor II, Damian attended a <a href="14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> incontinence were once more condemned. About two years later he fell ill at <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a> and nearly died, but suddenly, after seven weeks of pain, recovered, as he believed, through a <a href="10338a.htm">miracle</a>.</p>

<p>During his illness the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> died, and Frederic, <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, was elected as <a href="14290c.htm">Stephen X</a>. In the autumn of 1057, <a href="14290c.htm">Stephen X</a> determined to create Damian a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. For a long time he resisted the offer, but was finally forced, under threat of <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, to accept, and was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a> on 30 Nov., 1057. In addition he was appointed administrator of the <a href="07055a.htm">Diocese of Gubbio</a>. The new <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was impressed with the great responsibilities of his office and wrote a stirring letter to his brother-cardinals, exhorting them to shine by their example before all. Four months later Pope Stephen died at Florence and the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was once more distracted by <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. The <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="11346a.htm">Ostia</a> was vigorous in his opposition to the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="02429b.htm">Benedict X</a>, but force was on the side of the intruder and Damian retired to Fonte-Avallana. (<em>See</em> <a href="11055a.htm">NICHOLAS II</a>; <a href="06791c.htm">GREGORY VII</a>.)</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>About the end of the year 1059 Peter was sent as <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> by <a href="11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> had been, for some time, the prey of <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> and incontinence. So bad was the state of things, that <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> were openly bought and sold and the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> publicly "married" the <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> they lived with. But the faithful of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, led by <a href="01707b.htm">St. Ariald the Deacon</a> and <a href="01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, strove hard to remedy these evils. At length the contest between the two parties became so bitter that an appeal was made to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to decide the matter. <a href="11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> sent Damian and the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09405a.htm">Lucca</a> as his <a href="09118a.htm">legates</a>. But now the party of the irregular <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a> took alarm and raised the cry that <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> had no authority over <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>. At once Peter took action. Boldly confronting the rioters in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, he <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> to them the authority of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> with such effect that all parties submitted to his decision. He exacted first a solemn <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> from the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and all his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> that for the future no preferment should be paid for; then, imposing a penance on all who had been guilty, he re-instated in their <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a> all who under took to live continently. This prudent decision was attacked by some of the rigourists at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but was not reversed. Unfortunately, on the death of <a href="11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, the same disputes broke out; nor were they finally settled till after the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="01707b.htm">St. Ariald</a> in 1066. Meanwhile Peter was in vain pleading to be released from the cares of his office. Neither <a href="11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> nor <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> would consent to spare him.</p>

<p>In July, 1061, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> died and once more a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> ensued. Damian used all his powers to persuade the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="03128c.htm">Cadalous</a> to withdraw, but to no purpose. Finally Hanno, the Regent of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, summoned a council at <a href="02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> at which a long argument by St. Peter Damian was read and greatly contributed to the decision in favour of <a href="01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>. In 1063 the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> held a synod at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, at which Damian was appointed <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to settle the dispute between the Abbey of Cluny and the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>. He proceeded to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, summoned a council at Ch&acirc;lon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> the <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> of the contentions of Cluny, settled other questions at issue in the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and returned in the autumn to <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a>. While he was in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="03128c.htm">Cadalous</a> had again become active in his attempts to gain <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Damian brought upon himself a sharp reproof from Alexander and <a href="06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> for twice imprudently appealing to the royal power to judge the case anew. In 1067 the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was sent to Florence to settle the dispute between the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Vallombrosa, who accused the former of <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>. His efforts, however, were not successful, largely because he misjudged the case and threw the weight of his authority on the side of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The matter was not settled till the following year by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in person. In 1069 Damian went as the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> to prevent King Henry from repudiating his wife <a href="02519a.htm">Bertha</a>. This task he accomplished at a council at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> and returned to <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a>, were he was left in peace for two years.</p>

<p>Early in 1072 he was sent to <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> to reconcile its inhabitants to the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, they having been <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for supporting their <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in his adhesion to the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="03128c.htm">Cadalous</a>. On his return thence he was seized with fever near <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a>. He lay ill for a week at the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> degl'Angeli, now Santa Maria Vecchia. On the night preceding the feast of the Chair of St. Peter at <a href="01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, he ordered the office of the feast to be recited and at the end of the <a href="09038a.htm">Lauds</a> he died. He was at once buried in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> church, lest others should claim his <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>. Six times has his body been translated, each time to a more splendid resting-place. It now lies in a <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> <a href="04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a> in 1898. No formal <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a> ever took place, but his cultus has existed since his death at <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, at <a href="06128a.htm">Fonte-Avellana</a>, at <a href="10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, and at Cluny. In 1823 <a href="09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> extended his feast (23 Feb.) to the whole Church and pronounced him a <a href="05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>. The saint is represented in art as a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> bearing a discipline in his hand; also sometimes he is depicted as a pilgrim holding a <a href="03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>, to signify his many legations.</p>
