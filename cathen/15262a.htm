<p>The name is derived from the motherhouse, Vallombrosa (Latin <em>Vallis umbrosa,</em> shady valley), situated 20 miles from Florence on the northwest slope of Monte Secchieta in the Pratomagno chain, 3140 feet above the sea.</p>

<h2 id="section1">The founder</h2>

<p>St. John Gualbert, son of the noble Florentine Gualbert Visdomini, was born in 985 (or 995), and died at Passignano, 12 July, 1073, on which day his <a href="06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept; he was <a href="02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1193. One of his relatives having been <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a>, it became his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> to avenge the deceased. He met the murderer in a narrow lane and was about to slay him, but when the man threw himself upon the ground with arms outstretched in the form of a cross, he pardoned him for the <a href="09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>. On his way home, he entered the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Church at <a href="13449c.htm">San Miniato</a> to <a href="12345b.htm">pray</a>, and the figure on the crucifix bowed its head to him in recognition of his generosity. This story forms the subject of Burne-Jones's picture "The Merciful Knight", and has been adapted by Shorthouse in "John Inglesant". John Gualbert became a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> at <a href="13449c.htm">San Miniato</a>, but left that <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> to lead a more perfect life. His attraction was for the cenobitic not <a href="07280a.htm">eremitic</a> life, so after staying for some time with the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> at Camaldoli, he settled at Vallombrosa, where he founded his <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. <a href="09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> places the foundation a little before 1038. Here it is said he and his first companions lived for some years as <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a>, but this is rejected by Mart&egrave;ne as inconsistent with his reason for leaving Camaldoli. The <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a> of the early days of Vallombrosa has been much disputed. The dates given for the founder's conversion vary between 1004 and 1039, and a recent Vallumbrosan writer places his arrival at Vallombrosa as early as 1008. We reach surer ground with the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the church by Bl. Rotho, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, in 1038, and the donation by Itta, <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of the neighbouring <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sant' Ellero, of the site of the new foundation in 1039. The <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a> retained the privilege of nominating the superiors, but this right was granted to the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> by Victor II, who confirmed the order in 1056. Two centuries later, in the time of <a href="01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, the <a href="04340c.htm">nunnery</a> was united to Vallombrosa in spite of the protests of the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The holy lives of the first <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> at Vallombrosa attracted considerable attention and brought many requests for new foundations, but there were few <a href="12319b.htm">postulants</a>, since few could endure the extraordinary austerity of the life. Thus only one other <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, that of San Salvi at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, was founded during this period. But when the founder had mitigated his rule somewhat, three more <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded and three others reformed and united to the order during his lifetime. In the struggle of the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> against <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> the early Vallumbrosans took a considerable part, of which the most famous incident is the ordeal by fire undertaken successfully by <a href="11768c.htm">St. Peter Igneus</a> in 1068 (see Delarc, op. cit.). Shortly before this the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Salvi had been burned and the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> ill-treated by the anti-reform party. These events still further increased the repute of Vallombrosa.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Development of the order</h2>

<p>After the founder's death the order spread rapidly. A <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a> in 1090, which takes Vallombrosa under the protection of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, enumerates fifteen <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> besides the motherhouse. Twelve more are mentioned in a <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Paschal II in 1115, and twenty-four others in those of Anastasius IV (1153) and <a href="01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> (1156). By the time of <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> they numbered over sixty. All were situated in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, except two <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. About 1087 Bl. Andrew of Vallombrosa (d. 1112) founded the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cornilly in the <a href="11318b.htm">Diocese of Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and in 1093 the Abbey of Chezal-Beno&icirc;t, which became later the head of a considerable <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> congregation. There is no ground for the legend given by some writers of the order of a great Vallumbrosan Congregation in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> with an <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> near <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, founded by St. Louis. The Vallumbrosan Congregation was reformed in the middle of the fifteenth century by Cassinese <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and again by Bl. John Leonardi at the beginning of the seventeenth century. In 1485 certain <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> with that of San Salvi at Florence at their head, which had formed a separate congregation, were reunited to the motherhouse by <a href="08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>. At the beginning of the sixteenth century an attempt was made by Abbot-General Milanesi to found a house of studies on <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> lines at Vallombrosa; but in 1527 the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was burned by the troops of <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. It was rebuilt by Abbot Nicolini in 1637, and in 1634 an observatory was established. From 1662-80 the order was united to the <a href="14372c.htm">Sylvestrines</a>. In 1808 <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> troops plundered Vallombrosa, and the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> lay deserted till 1815. It was finally suppressed by the Italian Government in 1866. A few <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> remain to look after the church and meteorological station, but the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> buildings have become a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of forestry founded in 1870 on the German model, the only one of its kind in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Vallombrosa is also a health resort.</p>

<p>The decline of the order may be ascribed to the hard fate of the motherhouse, to <em>commendams,</em> and to the perpetual <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> which ravaged <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Practically all the surviving <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed during the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The present Vallumbrosan <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, besides Vallombrosa itself, are: Passignano, where St. John Gualbert is buried; S. Trinit&agrave; at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where the abbot-general resides; Sta Prassede, in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Galloro in the <a href="01255b.htm">Diocese of Albano</a>, with the sanctuary of Bl. Benedict Ricasoli (d. 1107); and the celebrated sanctuary of Montessoro in the <a href="09131a.htm">Diocese of Leghorn</a>. The modern <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Signol near Loriol, Dr&ocirc;me, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, was suppressed by the Ferry <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> in 1880. The present abbot-general is Fedele Tarani. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> now number about 100. The shield of the order shows the founder's arm in a tawny-coloured cowl grasping a golden crutch-shaped <a href="04515c.htm">crozier</a> on a blue ground. The services rendered by the order have been mostly in the field of asceticism. Besides the Vallumbrosan <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> alluded to in other parts of this article there may also be mentioned: Bl. Veridiana, <a href="01462b.htm">anchoress</a> (1208-42); Bl. Giovanni Dalle Celle (feast, 10 March); the <a href="09093a.htm">lay brother</a> Melior (1 Aug.). By the middle of the seventeenth century the order had supplied twelve <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and more than 30 <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. F. E. Hugford (1696-1771), born at Florence of <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="11478c.htm">parents</a>, is well known as one of the chief promoters of the art of <em>scagliola</em> (imitation of marble in plaster). Abbot-General Tamburini's works on canon law are well known. <a href="06342b.htm">Galileo</a> was for a time a <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a> at Vallombrosa and received part of his <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> there.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Rule</h2>

<p>St. John adopted <a href="02436a.htm">the Rule of St. Benedict</a> but added greatly to its austerity and penitential character. His <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> was to unite the ascetic advantages of the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitic</a> life to a life in community, while avoiding the dangers of the former. Severe scourging was inflicted for any breach of rule, silence was perpetual, poverty most severely enforced. The rule of enclosure was so strict that the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> might not go out even on an errand of mercy. The main point of divergence lay in the prohibition of the manual work, which is prescribed by St. Benedict. St. John's choir <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were to be pure contemplatives and to this end he introduced the system of lay-brothers who were to attend to the secular business. He was among the first to systematize this institution, and it is probable that it was largely popularized by the Vallumbrosans. The term <em>conversi</em> (<a href="09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>) occurs for the first time in Abbot Andrew of Strumi's Life of St. John, written at the beginning of the twelfth century. The Vallumbrosans do not, strictly speaking, form a separate order, but a <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> congregation, though they are not united to the confederated congregations of the Black Monks. The oldest extant <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the customs of Vallombrosa shows a close relationship with those of Cluny. The Vallumbrosans should be regarded only as <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> who followed the customs observed at that time by the <a href="02443a.htm">Black Benedictines</a> throughout <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. "Horror of <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a> was a special bond between them and Cluny, and it was only special circumstances which caused them later to be looked upon as a peculiar institute within the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> order" (Albers, op. cit. <em>infra</em>). The habit, originally grey, then tawny coloured, is now that of the Black Monks. The <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> were originally elected for life but are now elected at the general chapter, held every four years. The <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Vallombrosa, the superior of the whole order, had formerly a seat in the Florentine Senate and bore the additional title of Count of Monte Verde and Gualdo.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Nuns</h2>

<p>Shortly after the founder's death we find attached to the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Vallombrosa lay sisters who, under the charge of an aged <a href="09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, lived in a separate house and performed various household <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>. This institute survived for less than a century, but when they ceased to be attached to the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, these sisters probably continued to lead a conventual life. Bl. <a href="02519a.htm">Bertha</a> (d. 1163) entered the Vallumbrosan Order at Florence and reformed the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of Cavriglia in 1153. St. Umilt&agrave; is usually regarded as the foundress of the Vallumbrosan Nuns. She was born at <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a> about 1226, was married, but with the consent of her husband, who became a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, entered a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of canonesses and afterwards became an <a href="01462b.htm">anchoress</a> in a cell attached to the Vallumbrosan church of <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, where she lived for twelve years. At the request of the abbot-general she then founded a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> outside <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a> and became its <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>. In 1282 she founded a second <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where she died in 1310. She left a number of mystical writings. In 1524 the <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> obtained the Abbey of S. Salvi, Florence. There are still Vallumbrosan <a href="04340c.htm">nunneries</a> at <a href="05751b.htm">Faenza</a> and S. Gimignano, besides two at Florence. The <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of Bl. Umilt&agrave; and her disciple Bl. Margherita are <a href="05188b.htm">venerated</a> at the <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="14224a.htm">Spirito Santo</a> at Varlungo. The habit is similar to that of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Nuns.</p>
