<p>Ecclesiastical province; includes the <a href="06264a.htm">Archdiocese of Freiburg</a> and the suffragan Dioceses of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="09260a.htm">Limburg</a>, and <a href="13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>. The German Church was secularized by the Imperial Delegates Enactment of 25 Feb., 1803, confirmed by the <a href="06484b.htm">German Empire</a> on 24 March, and by the emperor on 27 April. All <a href="05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and religious foundations, <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, immediate or mediate, were used to compensate those rulers who had been <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to yield their possessions on the left bank of the Rhine to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. A part of the <a href="09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a> was preserved for the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> Karl Theodore von Dalberg and was transferred to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of <a href="12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, <a href="03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>, and Oldenburg also received <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lands. None of these thought of providing for the needs of their <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects by establishing new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The organization of the Confederation of the Rhine, the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and the supremacy in southern <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> of <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, who had no desire for the settlement of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> confusion in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, made it impossible to conclude a concordat.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The condition of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> grew desolate. New <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were not elected when the old <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> died, and the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters were combined. Besides Dalberg, those who laboured in the districts which now belong to the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of the Upper Rhine were: the former <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, Walderdorf, at Bruchsal (up to 1810), and Joseph Ludwig Colmar, at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (1802-18); in the Duchy of Nassau J. von Hommer, <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> vicar of <a href="15042a.htm">Trier</a>; Hubert Corden, at <a href="09260a.htm">Limburg</a>. There were also vicars of the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> Dalberg at Worms, <a href="05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a> (from 1817 at <a href="13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>), and <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>. From 1800 the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> at <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> was <a href="15590b.htm">Ignaz Heinrich von Wessenberg</a>, a Josephinist, who advocated a national German Church independent of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and introduced many anti-clerical innovations.</p>

<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> looked to the Congress of <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a> for the removal of their difficulties. This they hoped all the more, as those territories had been won again from <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> in compensation for which all landed possessions had been taken from the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a>, the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> representative at the congress, <a href="15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a>, the representative of the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> Dalberg, von Wambold, dean of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Worms, formally syndic of the collegiate <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Andreas at Worms, presented to the congress a number of memorials and statements on restoration of the earlier <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, the re-endowment of dioceses, and the founding of <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The congress maintained an unbroken silence; moreover, it disposed of the church lands on the recovered left bank of the Rhine. As the congress also divided the territories of the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> Dalberg, after its session closed the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was poorer than before. In vain Dalberg sought through his representative <a href="15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a> at the congress, and afterwards at the Diet of the Confederation at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, to bring it about that the church affairs of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should be made one of the matters to be settled by the Confederation. The reorganization of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and its equipment was left to the good will of the individual rulers. This was most disadvantageous, as <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles were regarded with strong disfavour by <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="09771a.htm">Freemasons</a>, and by adherents of <a href="06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> and Josephinism.</p>

<p>After <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had begun the negotiations with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> that led to the <a href="04196a.htm">concordats</a> of 1818 and 1821, the envoys of several <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> rulers met at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> in March, 1818, at the instance of <a href="15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, to confer concerning the condition of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in their respective countries, and to discuss the general principles which should be followed by the German states in concluding a concordat. This conference was attended by representatives of <a href="15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, of the Grand Duchies of Baden, <a href="10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a>, and <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, of the Electoral Principality of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, the Duchy of Nassau, <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, and of several North German states which later withdrew. In the opening address on 24 March, 1818, the envoy of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman See</a> the responsibility for the fact that <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs were not yet in an organized condition in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>; then he urged a close union of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> governments in their position towards <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and announced that the governments would take up the national Church schemes of <a href="07463a.htm">Febronius</a> in case <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was not willing to agree to the "favourable conditions" offered by the various countries. He called the church law devised by <a href="07463a.htm">Febronius</a> and <a href="08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, with its episcopal system, the "only <a href="13407a.htm">salvation</a>" of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The ends to be attained in negotiations with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> were: first, the reorganization of religious conditions "without endangering the <em>jura principum circa sacra</em> or granting <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> to the Roman Court whereby it could have a disadvantageous effect upon the peace, civil order, and civilization of the states"; secondly, "the introduction of a church system which would bring church affairs more into harmony with the constitution of the State and the present position of enlightenment, in order to set boundaries to the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> system which has lately threatened the states with obscurantism and all its consequences". In the seventeenth session it was decided that a concordat with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was not to be sought, but that the governments were to communicate to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in a "Declaration" what they were ready to concede to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>; the claims of the state <em>circa sacra</em> were embodied in an "Organic Statute", that was kept secret at first and was to be given to the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the respective countries at the close of the negotiations.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The "Declaration", in which Baden, <a href="15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, the two Hesses, Nassau, and Frankfort had agreed, were presented to <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, 23 March, 1819, by the ambassadors of the combined governments. On 10 Aug. this declaration was answered by <a href="04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a> in a celebrated report, and rejected by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. As, however, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> had requested the governments to take in hand, at least provisionally, the circumscription and filling of new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The representatives of the governments assembled once more at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, where new negotiations lasted from 22 April, 1820, to 24 Jan., 1821. The proposal for the circumscription of new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was accepted by the governments, and they further agreed among themselves to urge the founding of special <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for each country, and to demand that these <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> should not be exempt, but should be under a <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. The hope was that a church province with an <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> would be more independent of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> than exempt, isolated <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The church Province of the Upper Rhine, that was to be erected, was to include the Dioceses of <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, <a href="09260a.htm">Limburg</a>, <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and <a href="13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>, with the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="10244c.htm">see</a> at <a href="06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>. The desire of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> to have the <a href="02656a.htm">archiepiscopal See of St. Boniface</a> re-established at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> failed of accomplishment, on account of the opposition of <a href="15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> and Nassau. In March, 1821, the draft of an organization and the documents which designated the amounts <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the endowment of the sees were sent to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. On the basis of these documents <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> issued, 16 Aug., 1821 the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> of circumscription "Provida sollersque" suppressing the Bishopric of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> and the provostship of <a href="05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, and canonically erecting the church Province of the Upper Rhine with the <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> already mentioned.</p>

<p>Although the governments were only partially satisfied with the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, still it was accepted by their representatives at <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>; its publication, however, was postponed. The principles and schemes of the combined governments as to national Churches, concerning which no agreement had been reached with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, were set forth by the assembled diplomats in the "Fundamental Instrument" and the "Church Pragmatic". These two documents demanded the complete control of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> system by the State. It was the intention of the governments, as soon as <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> had established the new <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, to force upon the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> this right of the State over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, which under no circumstances could have received the approval of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In a secret treaty between the states, 8 Feb., 1822, it was agreed that the "Church Pragmatic" was to be made binding upon the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and canons. The governments also hastened to select their candidates for the new sees, some states asking the advice of the deans of the chapters. The candidates thus chosen were bound to observe the "Church Pragmatic". The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, when informed of these proceedings by Vicar General von Kempff, who was under consideration as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, rejected on 13 June, 1823, both the candidates nominated for <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the whole of the "Church Pragmatic". Negotiations were again broken off. However, the necessity, which was every day more apparent, of reestablishing settled church relations and the lack of agreement among the governments led Baden, first of all, to open new and confidential negotiations for itself with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The results of these negotiations were four propositions which were sent as the ultimatum of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to the Government of Baden on 8 Dec., 1824. These propositions regulated the method of filling the <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, the first and later appointments of the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter, and the founding of a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for priests; they also demanded a, freer intercourse with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and the free exercise of <a href="08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> according to the canons of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Baden accepted these propositions, with some changes conceded by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. Divided into six articles these propositions were communicated after this, on 6 July, 1825, to the other courts that had negotiated with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The united governments accepted the articles, 4 Aug., 1826, and communicated their acceptance to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, 4-7 Sept., demanding, however, the omission of the articles which treated of the endowment of the <a href="13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and guaranteed the freedom of the administration of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. According to their own declarations these reservations of the governments did not imply the validity of the principles of the "Church Pragmatic", and, as the governments made no reply to the explanations which the Pope gave to these points, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> assumed that the <a href="05141a.htm">doubts</a> of the Governments over these points had disappeared. Consequently on 11 April, 1827, he issued the supplementary <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Ad Dominici gregis custodiam", which incorporated the articles in their entirety. Upon this the two <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, "Provida sollersque" and "Ad Dominici gregis custodiam", were published in full by the Governments of Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Cassel, <a href="15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, and Nassau. The <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> received the approval of the Governments only "so far as such have for their object the formation of the <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine, the circumscription, equipment, and founding of the five <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> belonging to it with their <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters, also the filling of the <a href="01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>, the <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, and the offices of the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> foundations".</p>

<p>After the <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> had been proclaimed by the Governments, the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were elected. After the Government of Baden had dropped its former candidate, <a href="15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a>, the first <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Bernhard Boll, <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> of M&uuml;nster; the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="09260a.htm">Limburg</a> was Brand; of <a href="13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>, J. B. Keller; of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, Rieger; of <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Burg. The <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine was now established, and the <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> filled, but satisfactory relations between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> had not yet been attained. The Governments did not abandon their plan to extend the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions as far as possible. No determined resistance was to be expected from most of the new <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were either weak men or confidants of the Governments. Consequently, on 30 Jan., 1830, the Governments issued jointly an "Ordinance respecting the exercise of the constitutional right of the State to protect and supervise the Catholic national Church", containing thirty-nine articles, which were essentially only a revised form of the "Church Pragmatic" of <a href="06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> protested at once, although in vain. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter also <a href="06147a.htm">courageously</a> opposed the ordinance, and obtained the mitigation of the most severe regulations. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> accepted at first without opposition the publication of the ordinance of the sovereign. Still, in their <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> also there were later violent struggles between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a>.</p>
