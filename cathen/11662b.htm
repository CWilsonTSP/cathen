<p>Mayor of the Palace of the whole <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom (both Austrasia and Neustria), and later King of the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>; born 714; died at St. Denis, 24 September, 768. He was the son of <a href="03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>. Pepin and his older brother Carloman were taught by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of St. Denis, and the impressions received during their monastic <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> had a controlling influence upon the relations of both princes to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. When the father died in 741 the two brothers began to reign jointly but not without strong opposition, for Griffon, the son of <a href="03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> and the <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Sonnichilde, demanded a share in the government. Moreover, the Duke of the Aquitanians and the Duke of the Alamannians thought this a favourable opportunity to throw off the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> supremacy. The young kings were repeatedly involved in <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, but all their opponents, including the Bavarians and Saxons, were defeated and the unity of the kingdom re-established. As early as 741 Carloman had entered upon his epoch-making relations with <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, to whom was now opened a new field of labour, the reformation of the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Church. On 21 April, 742, <a href="02656a.htm">Boniface</a> was present at a <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> synod presided over by Carloman at which important reforms were decreed. As in the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> realm the unity of the kingdom was essentially connected with the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of the king, Carloman to secure this unity raised the Merovingian Childeric to the throne (743). In 747 he resolved to enter a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The danger, which up to this time had threatened the unity of the kingdom from the division of power between the two brothers, was removed, and at the same time the way was prepared for the deposing of the last Merovingian and for the crowning of Pepin. The latter put down the renewed revolt led by his step-brother Griffon, and succeeded in completely restoring the boundaries of the kingdom. Pepin now addressed to the Pope the suggestive question: In regard to the kings of the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a> who no longer possess the royal power, is this state of things proper? Hard pressed by the Lombards, <a href="15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a> welcomed this advance of the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a> which aimed at ending an intolerable condition of things, and at laying the constitutional foundations for the exercise of the royal power. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> replied that such a state of things was not proper. After this decision the place Pepin desired to occupy was declared vacant. The crown was given him not by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> but by the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>. According to the ancient custom Pepin was then elected king and soon after this was anointed by <a href="02656a.htm">Boniface</a>. This <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the new kingdom by the head of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was intended to remove any <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to its legitimacy. On the contrary, the consciousness of having saved the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a> from the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> produced, among the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a>, the feeling that their kingdom owed its authority directly to <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. Still this external cooperation of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> in the transfer of the kingdom to the Carolingians would necessarily enhance the importance of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. The relations between the two controlling powers of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> now rapidly developed. It was soon evident to what extent the alliance between <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> was to check the decline of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and civil life; it made possible the conversion of the still <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> German tribes, and when that was accomplished provided an opportunity for both <a href="14250c.htm">Church and State</a> to recruit strength and to grow.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical, political, and <a href="12213b.htm">economic</a> developments had made the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> lords of the <em>ducatus Romanus.</em> They laid before Pepin their claims to the central provinces of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which had belonged to them before Liutprand's conquest. When <a href="14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> had a conference with King Pepin at Ponthion in January, 754, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> implored his assistance against his oppressor the Lombard <a href="01237d.htm">King Aistulf</a>, and begged for the same protection for the prerogatives of St. Peter which the Byzantine exarchs had extended to them, to which the king agreed, and in the charter establishing the <a href="14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, soon after given at Quiercy, he promised to restore these prerogatives. The <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king received the title of the former representative of the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, i.e. "Patricius", and was also assigned the <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> of protecting the privileges of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.</p>

<p>When <a href="14288c.htm">Stephen II</a> performed the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of anointing Pepin and his son at St. Denis, it was St. Peter who was regarded as the mystical giver of the <a href="02137c.htm">secular power</a>, but the emphasis thus laid upon the <a href="12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="03584b.htm">character</a> of political law left vague the legal relations between <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> and king. After the acknowledgment of his territorial claims the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> was in reality a ruling sovereign, but he had placed himself under the protection of the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> ruler and had sworn that he and his people would be <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> to the king. Thus his sovereignty was limited from the very start as regards what was external to his domain. The connection between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom involved Pepin during the years 754-56 in <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with the Lombard <a href="01237d.htm">King Aistulf</a>, who was forced to return to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> the territory he had illegally held. Pepin's commanding position in the world of his time was permanently secured when he took Septimania from the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Another particularly important act was his renewed overthrow of the rebellion in Aquitaine which was once more made a part of the kingdom. He was not so fortunate in his campaigns against the Saxons and Bavarians. He could do no more than repeatedly attempt to protect the boundaries of the kingdom against the incessantly restless Saxons. <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> remained an entirely independent State and advanced in civilization under Duke Tassilo. Pepin's activity in <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> was accompanied by a widely extended activity in the internal affairs of the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom, his main object being the reform of legislation and internal affairs, especially of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions. He continued the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms commenced by <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. In doing this Pepin demanded an unlimited authority over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. He himself wished to be the leader of the reforms. However, although <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> changed nothing by his reformatory labours in the ecclesiastico-political relations that had developed in the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom upon the basis of the Germanic conception of the State, nevertheless he had placed the purified and united <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Church more definitely under the control of the <a href="07424b.htm">papal see</a> than had hitherto been the case. From the time of <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was more generally acknowledged by the <a href="06238a.htm">Franks</a> to be the mystical power appointed by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>. When he deposed the last of the Merovingians Pepin was also <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to acknowledge the increased authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> by calling upon it for moral support. Consequently the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supremacy of the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king over the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of his country remained externally undiminished. Nevertheless by his life-work Pepin had powerfully aided the authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and with it the conception of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity. He was <a href="03071a.htm">buried</a> at St. Denis where he died. He preserved the empire created by <a href="04070a.htm">Clovis</a> from the destruction that menaced it; he was able to overcome the great danger arising from social conditions that threatened the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom, by opposing to the unruly lay nobility the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> aristocracy that had been strengthened by the general reform. When he died the means had been created by which his greater son could solve the problems of the empire. Pepin's policy marked out the tasks to which <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> devoted himself: quieting the Saxons, the subjection of the duchies and lastly, the regulation of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> question and with it that of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>
