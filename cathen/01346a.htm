<p>In the New Law the altar is the table on which the <a href="10006a.htm">Eucharistic Sacrifice</a> is offered. Mass may sometimes be celebrated outside a sacred place, but never without an altar, or at least an <a href="01357b.htm">altar-stone</a>. In <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> we find only two exceptions: St. Lucian (312) is said to have celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> on his breast whilst in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, and Theodore <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="15109a.htm">Tyre</a> on the hands of his <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> (Mabillon, Praef. in 3 saec., n. 79). According to Radulphus of Oxford (Prop. 25), <a href="14031c.htm">St. Sixtus II</a> (257-259) was the first to prescribe that Mass should be celebrated on an altar, and the <a href="13216a.htm">rubric</a> of the <a href="10354c.htm">missal</a> (XX) is merely a new <a href="12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. It signifies, according to Amalarius (De Eccles. Officiis, I, xxiv) the Table of the Lord (<em>mensa Domini</em>), referring to the <a href="14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>, or the Cross (<a href="02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, De Coena Domini), or <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, IV, De Sacram. xii; Abbot Rupert, V, xxx). The last meaning explains the <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> paid to it by <a href="07716a.htm">incensing</a> it, and the five crosses engraved on it signify <a href="15714a.htm">His five wounds</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Position</h2>

<p>In the ancient <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, as he stood at the altar, faced the people. The <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of the Roman Empire were, as a rule, law courts or meeting places. They were generally spacious, and the interior area was separated by two, or, it might be, four rows of pillars, forming a central <a href="10724a.htm">nave</a> and side <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a>. The end opposite the entrance had a semi-circular shape, called the <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a>, and in this portion, which was raised above the level of the floor, sat the judge and his assessors, while right before him stood an altar upon which sacrifice was offered before beginning any important public business.</p>

<p>When these public buildings were adapted for <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> assemblies, slight modifications were made. The <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> was reserved for the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the faithful occupied the centre and side <a href="01237c.htm">aisles</a>, while between the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people stood the altar. Later on the altar was placed, in churches, in the <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> against, or at least near, the wall, so that the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> when celebrating faced the east, and behind him the people were placed. In primitive times there was but one altar in each church. <a href="07644a.htm">St. Ignatius the Martyr</a>, <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, and <a href="08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, speak of only one altar (<a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, De Sacr. Missae, no. 1, xvii). Some think that more than one altar existed in the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> in the time of <a href="01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, because he sometimes uses the word <em>altaria</em>, although others are of opinion that <em>altaria</em> in this place means an altar. Towards the end of the sixth century we find evidence of a plurality of altars, for <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> sent <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> for four altars to <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saintes, <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, who had placed in a church thirteen altars, four of which remained unconsecrated for want of <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>. Although there was only one altar in each church, minor altars were erected in side <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, which were distinct buildings (as is the custom in the Greek, and some <a href="05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> even at the present day) in which <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated only once on the same day in each church (<a href="02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, Ibidem). The fact that in the early ages of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> only the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>, assisted by his <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who received <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> from the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands, is the reason that only one altar was erected in each church, but after the introduction of private Masses the necessity of several altars in each church arose.</p>

<h2>Material of altars</h2>

<p>Although no documents are extant to indicate the material of which altars were made in the first centuries of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, it is probable that they were made of wood, like that used by <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> at the <a href="14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>. At <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> such a wooden table is still preserved in the <a href="09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>, and fragments of another such table are preserved in the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Pudentiana, on which St. Peter is said to have celebrated <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a>. During the persecutions, when the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were forced to move from one place to another, and <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated in <a href="04558a.htm">crypts</a>, private houses, the open air, and <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, except when the <em><a href="01699a.htm">arcosolia</a></em> were used (see below, FORM OF AN ALTAR), it is but natural to suppose that they were made of wood, probably wooden chests carried about by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, on the lid of which the Eucharistic Sacrifice was celebrated. <a href="11262b.htm">St. Optatus of Mileve</a> (<em>De Schismate Donatistarum</em>) reproves the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> for breaking up and using for firewood the altars of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, and <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (Epist. clxxxv) reports that Bishop Maximianus was beaten with the wood of the altar under which he had taken refuge. We have every reason to suppose that in places in which the persecutions were not raging, altars of stone also were in use. <a href="07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a> in the third century built a vast basilica in Neo-Caesarea in which it is probable that more substantial altars were erected. <a href="07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> speaks of the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of an altar made of stone (<em>De Christi Baptismate</em>). Pulcheria, sister of Theodosius II, presented an altar of gold to the Basilica of Constantinople; <a href="07202b.htm">St. Helena</a> gave golden altars ornamented with precious stones to the church which was erected on the site where the Cross had been concealed for three hundred years; the Popes <a href="14032a.htm">St. Sixtus III</a> (432-440) and St. Hilary (461-468) presented several altars of silver to the churches of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Since wood is subject to decay, the baser metals to corrosion, and the more precious metals were too expensive, stone became in course of <a href="14726a.htm">time</a> the ordinary material for an altar. Besides, stone is durable and, according to <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs4">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>), symbolizes <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a> &#151; "And the rock was <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>". The <a href="16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> (9 November) asserts that <a href="14370a.htm">St. Sylvester</a> (314-335) was the first to issue a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> that the altar should be of stone. But of such a <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> there is no documentary evidence, and no mention is made of it in canon law, in which so many other decrees of this Pope are inserted. Moreover, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that after that <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> altars of wood and of metal were erected. The earliest <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of a council which prescribed that an altar which is to be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> should be of stone is that of the provincial council of Epeaune (Pamiers), <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, in 517 (Labbe, Concil. tom. V, col. 771). The present <a href="05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> requires that for the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of an altar it must be of stone.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>Form of an altar</h2>

<p>In the primitive times there were two kinds of altars:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>The <em><a href="01699a.htm">arcosolium</a></em> or <em>monumentum arcuatum</em>, which was formed by cutting in the tufa wall of the wider spaces in the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, an arch-like niche, over a grave or sarcophagus. The latter contained the remains of one or several <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and rose about three feet above the floor. On it was placed horizontally a slab of marble, called the <em>mensa</em>, on which <a href="10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated.</li><li>The altar detached from the wall in the <em>cubicula,</em> or sepulchral <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a> surrounded by <em>loculi</em> and <em><a href="01699a.htm">arcosolia</a></em>, used as places of worship in the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a> or in the churches erected above ground after the time of Constantine. This second kind of altar consisted of a square or oblong slab of stone or marble which rested on columns, one to six in number, or on a structure of masonry in which were enclosed the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Sometimes two or four slabs of stone were placed vertically under the table, forming a stone chest. In private <a href="11271a.htm">oratories</a> the table was sometimes made of wood and rested on a wooden support. Within this support were placed the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and in order to be able to expose them to view, folding doors were fixed on the front.</li></ul></div>

<p>The <a href="09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a> states that <a href="06029b.htm">St. Felix I</a> decreed that Mass should be celebrated on the <a href="14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. This no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> brought about both a change of form, from that of a simple table to that of a chest or <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and the rule that every altar must contain the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Usually the altar was raised on steps, from which the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> sometimes preached (see <a href="01356f.htm">ALTAR-STEPS</a>). Originally it was made in the shape of an ordinary table, but gradually a step was introduced behind it and raised slightly above it (see <a href="01354d.htm">ALTAR-LEDGE</a>). When the tabernacle was introduced the number of these steps was increased. The altar is covered, at least in <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a> and also in large churches, by a canopy supported by columns, called the <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a> (see <a href="01351a.htm">ALTAR-CANOPY</a>), upon which were placed, or from which were suspended, vases, crowns, baskets of silver, as decorations. From the middle of the <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a>, formerly, a gold or silver dove was suspended to serve as a <a href="12588a.htm">pyx</a> in which the <a href="05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was reserved. Veils or curtains were attached to the columns which supported the <a href="03767a.htm">ciborium</a>. (See <a href="01353a.htm">ALTAR-CURTAIN</a>) The altar was often encircled by railings of wood, or metal, called <em>cancelli</em>, or by low walls of marble slabs called <em>tranennae.</em> According to the present <a href="05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, there are two kinds of altars, the fixed and the portable. Both these <a href="13674a.htm">denominations</a> have a twofold meaning, i.e. an altar may be fixed or portable either in a wider sense or in the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> meaning. A fixed altar, in a wider sense, is one that is attached to a wall, a floor, or a column whether it be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> or not; in the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a>; sense it is a permanent structure of stone, consisting of a <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> table and support, which must be built on a solid foundation. A <a href="01348b.htm">portable altar</a> in a wider sense is one that may be carried from one place to another in the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> sense it is a <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="01357b.htm">altar-stone</a>, sufficiently large to hold the Sacred Host and the greater part of the base of the <a href="03561a.htm">chalice</a>. It is inserted in the table of an altar which is not a <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> fixed altar.</p>

<p>The component parts of a fixed altar in the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> sense are the table (<em>mensa</em>), the support (<em>stipes</em>) and the <em>sepulchrum</em>. (See <a href="01351d.htm">ALTAR-CAVITY</a>.) The table must be a single slab of stone firmly joined by cement to the support, so that the table and support together make one piece. The surface of this table should be perfectly smooth and polished. Five Greek crosses are engraved on its surface, one at each of the four corners, about six inches from both edges. but directly above the support, and one in the centre. The support may be either a solid mass or it may consist of four or more columns. These must be of natural stone, firmly joined to the table. The substructure need not, however, consist of one piece, but should in every case be built on a solid foundation so as to make the structure permanent. The support may have any of the following forms:</p>

<div class="bulletlist"><ul><li>at each corner a column of natural stone, and the spaces between the columns may be filled with any kind of stone, brick, or cement;</li><li>the space between the two columns in front may be left open, so as to place beneath the table (exposed) a <a href="12762a.htm">reliquary</a> containing the body (or a portion of the body) of a saint;</li><li>besides the four columns, one at each corner, a fifth column may be placed in the centre at the front. In this case the back, and if desired the sides also, may be filled with stone, brick, or cement;</li><li>if the table is small (it should in every case be larger than the stone of a <a href="01348b.htm">portable altar</a>), four columns are placed under it, one at each corner and, to make up the full length required, frames of stone or other material may be added to each side. These added portions are not <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and hence may be constructed after the <a href="03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a>;</li><li>if the table is deficient in width, four columns are placed under it, one at each corner, and a frame of stone or other material is added to the back. This addition is not <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and may be constructed after the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the altar.</li></ul></div>

<p>In the last two cases the spaces between the columns may be filled with stone brick, or cement, or they may be left open. In every case the substructure may be a solid mass, or the interior may remain hollow, but this hollow space is not to be used as a closet for storing articles of any kind, even such as belong to the altar. Neither the <a href="13216a.htm">rubrics</a> nor the Sacred Congregation of Rites prescribe any dimensions for an altar. It ought, however, to be large enough to allow a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> conveniently to celebrate the <a href="10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> upon it in such a manner that all the ceremonies can be decorously observed. Hence altars at which solemn services are celebrated require to be of greater dimensions than other altars. From the words of the Pontifical we infer that the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a> must stand free on all sides (<em>Pontifex circuit septies tabulam altaris</em>), but the back part of smaller altars may be built against the wall.</p>
