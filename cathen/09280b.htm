<p>(JOSSE LIPS)</p>

<p>A philologian and <a href="07538b.htm">humanist</a> of the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, b. at Overyssche, 18 Oct., 1547; d. at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, 23 March, 1606. Descended from an illustrious <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, he studied first at Ath, and afterwards at the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">College</a>, Cologne. He wished to enter the <a href="14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> on 29 Sept., 1562, and become a <a href="11144a.htm">novice</a>. But this displeased his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, who recalled him and sent him to study <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and literature at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. In this <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> Pierre Nannius (Nanninck) had established in the Collegium Trilingue a fine <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of philology, which was at the time directed by Valerius (Corneille Wouters). There Lipsius found companions such as Louis Carrion Jean Dousa, Martin Delrio, Andre Schott. He ardently took up the emendation and critical examination of Latin texts, especially of Cicero, Propertius, and Varro, and, as early as 1566, had collected three books of "Variae Lectiones", which were published in 1569 at <a href="01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, dedicated to <a href="06727a.htm">Cardinal Granvelle</a>. The latter, who was in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, made him his Latin secretary (1569-70). Lipsius returned to <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, but left it again in 1571, alarmed by the government of the Duke of Alba. He made a more or less prolonged stay at <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, Dole, <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and Jena. In the last city he became a <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, and, all through the constant changes of confessions of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and religious tendencies, he was careful to be constantly with the masters of the moment. On a visit to Cologne he met a <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a>, a native of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and married her although she was older than he (1573). She refused to accompany him to Jena and he resigned his professorship there in February, 1574. Settled at Cologne he supervised the publication of his "Tacitus" (Antwerp, 1574). He was the first scholar to differentiate the "Annals" from the "History", and although he did not have access to the principal <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> &mdash; the two Medicean <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> &mdash; he introduced in his text over 450 emendations, which have been accepted by all subsequent editors. It was only much later for his fourth edition (1605), that he became acquainted with these <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> through the Pichena edition (1600). He also deserves commendation for his use of inscriptions in the explanation of texts. At the same time appeared "Antiquae lectiones" (Antwerp, 1575), miscellaneous criticisms devoted mainly to Plautus, to the fragmentary works of archaic authors, or to Propertius.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Lipsius was lecturing at <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> during the following years (1576-77), but the victory of Don John of <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> forced him to go over to Leyden where he taught in the newly founded <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> (1578-91). During this period he published collections of his letters, new conjectures, antiquarian dissertations, and two new editions of Tacitus with an historical commentary. Apart from the philological works, he composed treatises on politics and ethics; of these the treatise on constancy (De Constantia, Antwerp, 1584) is the best known, and has had thirty-two editions without including the translations. However, Leyden was not favourable to his health, and he and his wife regretted their native town. He had already made an attempt to get away in 1586. The States and the city did their utmost to detain him. In 1590 Dirk Coornhert publicly called upon him to take sides in the religious controversies. Lipsius answered evasively and tried to dissemble. Finally, he left the city and became reconciled with <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Chapel at <a href="09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (April, 1591). He went to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in search of health, and during a sojourn at <a href="09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> he prepared new works, drew from a psalter of the ninth century <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> glosses of great interest, and was finally forgiven for his stay in an <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> country rebellious to the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. From that time began a new period in Lipsius's life. Coldly received at first by some of his compatriots, but encouraged by a few warm admirers, he was appointed professor of history and Latin at the Collegiurn Trilingue of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (1592), then historiographer to the King of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1595), and later honorary member of the State Council (1605). To give a <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> of his <a href="12748a.htm">piety</a>, he wrote the "De Cruce" (1593), in which confusion between <em>patibulum</em> and <em>crux</em> often make the conclusions debatable.</p>

<p>Lipsius contemplated writing a general treatise on Roman antiquities (Fax historica), and, as a result of his studies, produced treatises on the army ("Demilitia romana", Antwerp, 1595) and on the defence and attack of fortified towns ("Poliorceticon", Antwerp, 1596), a kind of statistical work on the Roman Empire ("Admiranda," 1598), short dissertations upon <a href="09227b.htm">libraries</a>, upon Vesta, and the Vestals (1602). However, every now and then, his religious wanderings were recalled to the public mind. He succeeded in producing the impression that one of his former discourses of Jena "De duplici concordia", published at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a> in 1599, was not his. He himself called forth the sneers and the refutations of the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestants</a> by describing the veneration and the <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> of Our Lady of Hal (1604), and of Our Lady of Montaigu (1605). His coreligionists greatly respected and trusted him. In 1599 Archduke Albert and his wife Isabella, having come on a visit to <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, expressed the wish to have him prepare a Latin oration, which he did within two hours. He chose as a subject the greatness of a prince, from a passage of Seneca (De Clementia, I, iii). Many imaginary accounts have been given of this speech, Lipsius did not broach the subject of clemency, and still less did he interrupt one of his lectures to bring it up before the princes. The discourse was published in 1600, with Pliny's panegyric of <a href="15015a.htm">Trajan</a> and a commentary on this work. But Lipsius's most important works of this period were on Seneca and <a href="14299a.htm">Stoicism</a>. He wished to explain in detail the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoic</a> philosophy, for which he professed the greatest admiration, objecting only to its toleration of <a href="14326b.htm">suicide</a>. He has time only for a general outline of the system and of its place in ancient philosophy ("Manuductionis ad stoicam philosophiam libri III", 1604), and an analysis of the <a href="14580a.htm">theology</a>, the physics, and the <a href="04413a.htm">cosmology</a> of the <a href="14299a.htm">Stoics</a> ("Physiologiae stoicorum libri III", 1604); he had not time to write the ethics. Nevertheless these two works are even today the most complete treatise ever written on <a href="14299a.htm">Stoicism</a> as a whole. The "Seneca" glass published in 1605 with a dedication to <a href="11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>. Unfortunately, Lipsius was misled by a poor <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> which he believed excellent, and the commentary concerns the Epistles to Lucilius only. His last work was a description and history of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (1605).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Before his death he gave solemn expression to his <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>. His <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> have been in the Leyden <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> since 1722. There have been four editions of his complete works (Lyons, 1613; Antwerp, 1614; Antwerp, 1637, a very fine one; Wesel, 1675). In religion, for a long time, Lipsius held aloof from both parties. His "Politica" (1589) were considered too severe in <a href="10759a.htm">Holland</a> and too tolerant at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He escaped being placed on the <a href="07721a.htm">Index</a> only by accepting torture as a legitimate last resort to bring back <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> (1593). He believed, however, in sorcerers, in charms and spells, and in the commerce of <a href="15674a.htm">witches</a> with <a href="04764a.htm">devils</a>, from which children were born (Phys. stoic., p. 61) His philological work is brilliant, but at times superficial. He <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> little Greek, but was well acquainted with Roman antiquity. His "Tacitus" is a masterpiece of discernment and erudition. His Latin style is peculiar. He chose to imitate the style of Tacitus and Apuleius, which <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be criticised by Henry Estienne (1595). Notwithstanding some imperfections, he is, with Joseph Scaliger, Casaubon, and Saumaise, one of the most eminent representatives of classical philology between 1550 and 1650.</p>
