<p>(Sometimes spelled JIM&Eacute;NEZ).</p>

<p><a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, born at Torrelaguna in New Castile, 1436; died at Roa, near <a href="15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, 1517. He was <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> and Salamanca and, having graduated in canon and <a href="09066a.htm">civil law</a>, went to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1459 where he practised for some years as a consistorial advocate. Having attracted the notice of <a href="14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, that <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> promised him the first vacant <a href="02473c.htm">benefice</a> in his native province. This proved to be that of Uzeda, which Carillo, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, wished to bestow upon one of his own followers. Xim&eacute;nez asserted his claim to it and for doing so was <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, first at Uzeda and afterwards in the fortress of Santorcaz. He was released in 1480, after six years' confinement, and transferring to the <a href="13788a.htm">Diocese of Sig&uuml;enza</a>, became grand vicar to Cardinal Gonzalez, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that <a href="05001a.htm">see</a>. In 1484 he resigned this office to become a <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> of the Observantine Congregation in the Friary of St. John at Toledo. From there, after his profession, he was sent to Salzeda, where he was later elected guardian.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1492, on the recommendation of Cardinal Mendoza, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, he was appointed confessor to Queen Isabella, which post he accepted on condition that he might still live in his <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> and follow the <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>, only appearing at Court when sent for. About the same time he was elected <a href="12514b.htm">provincial</a> of his order in Castile, which office he held for three years. In 1495 he was chosen to succeed Mendoza as <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, to which post the chancellorship of <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a> had been joined by Ferdinand and Isabella. Xim&eacute;nez refused the dignity out of <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a>, and persisted in his refusal for six months, only consenting at length to accept the position in obedience to the express command of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. As <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> he continued to live as a simple <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, devoting a large portion of his vast revenues to the relief of the poor and the ransom of captives. This mode of life was misunderstood by many, and, in consequence of reports that reached <a href="01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, that pontiff reprimanded him for neglecting the external splendour that belonged to his rank; but Xim&eacute;nez would only consent to wear the episcopal dress in such a way that his friar's habit underneath might remain visible. His <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> found scope in an endeavour to reform the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and canons of Toledo. He <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> his own religious brethren to observe the rule against the holding of <a href="12462a.htm">property</a>, and many <a href="06280b.htm">friars</a> left <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> in consequence. As chancellor he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take a prominent part of the affairs of the State, where his <a href="12517b.htm">prudence</a> and wisdom were of great value to his country.</p>

<p>He gained renown also as a patron of learning, and about the year 1504 founded the <a href="01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>, to fill the professorial chairs of which he procured some of the most distinguished scholars from <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Bologna, and Salamanca. Such was the esteem in which this new <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was held that all the <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, except the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and <a href="07345a.htm">Hieronymites</a>, established houses at <a href="01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> in connection with it. King Ferdinand visited the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> in 1514 and highly approved of all that Xim&eacute;nez had done. In 1502 the <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> undertook the publication of the first Polyglot Bible, called the Complutesian, <em>Complutum</em> being the Latin name for Alcal&aacute;. This Bible had a great influence on subsequent biblical study; it was dedicated to <a href="09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, and its compilation occupied Xim&eacute;nez fifteen years, being completed in 1517, only four months before his death, and costing him about &#163;25,000 ($125,000). The restoration of the ancient Mozarabic Rite at Toledo was another of his projects. For its celebration he added, in 1500, a special <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> to his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and established a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to serve it. Later on similar institutions arose at Valladolid and Salamanca; at Toledo its use continues to the present day.</p>

<p>In 1499 Xim&eacute;nez accompanied Ferdinand and Isabella on their visit to the newly-conquered province of <a href="06723a.htm">Granada</a>, and his labours there for the conversion of the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a> met with considerable success. On the death of Isabella (1504) he was again drawn into politics in connection with the disputed succession to the throne of Castile. Philip of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> died in 1506, and, Ferdinand being absent in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Xim&eacute;nez was appointed viceroy of the kingdom and guardian of Juana, Philip's <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a>, who had lost her reason. In the following year Ferdinand became regent of <a href="03410b.htm">Castile</a>, and one of his first acts was to procure from <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a> the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat for Xim&eacute;nez, who was at the same time named Grand Inquisitor of Castile and <a href="09175a.htm">Leon</a>. The establishment of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> has been wrongly attributed to him; it had been in existence fully ten years before his first appearance at Court. As grand inquisitor he initiated several reforms in its working and used every endeavour to reduce the number of cases reserved for its tribunal. He carefully watched the various officers of the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, lest they should abuse their power by undue <a href="15446a.htm">violence</a> or oppression, and he arranged and circumscribed the limits of their <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. He protected scholars and professors from the examination and supervision of the Inquisitors, and issued beneficient regulations regarding the instruction and conduct of new converts, so as to guard them against <a href="14339a.htm">superstition</a> and <a href="02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. An examination of some of the various cases investigated and adjudged by Zimenez shows the care and diligence he exercised in discharging the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of an office which has been much <a href="03190c.htm">calumniated</a> and misunderstood. Severe he certainly was, but always straightforward and just in the wielding of his authority as grand inquisitor.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In 1509, at his repeated request, Ferdinand fitted out an expedition against the <a href="10424a.htm">Moors</a>, and, accompanied by two canons of his <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, Xim&eacute;nez himself led the army. Inspired by his example and exhortations, the Spanish forces took the city of <a href="11266a.htm">Oran</a> by assault. In his untiring <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the propagation of the Faith, Xim&eacute;nez endeavoured to make the victory a religious one; numbers of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives were liberated, and several mosques turned into <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches. On his return to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was received as a conquering hero both at <a href="01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> and Toledo. About this time a serious rupture occurred in the relations between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, owing to the growing power of Louis XII, which <a href="08562a.htm">Julius II</a> feared might endanger the authority of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. To counteract it, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> took sides with the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Republic against <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, notwithstanding the fact that only a short time previously, when the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a> had taken possession of part of the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, it was by the help of Louis that they had been restored to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. For this ingratitude on the part of Julius, Louis vowed vengeance and, if possible, the overthrow of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. He attacked the spiritualities of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> with regard to <a href="02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and the French army took possession of Bologna, which belonged to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. At the same time Louis and the Emperor Maximilian, supported by seven <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, chiefly French, took upon themselves to convene a council at <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, summoning Julius to attend. They accused him of having disturbed the peace of <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>, of having obtained the <a href="12260a.htm">papacy</a> by means of <a href="14001a.htm">simony</a>, and of having failed to keep his promise to convoke a <a href="04423f.htm">general council</a> of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. Julius determined to free <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> of the French and appealed to Ferdinand for help against Louis. By the advice of Xim&eacute;nez Ferdinand agreed to suspend operations in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a> and to send his forces to assist the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and by the end of 1512 the French had been driven out of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Synod of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> was opened on 1 Nov., 1511, seven <a href="03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and about twenty <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> being present. the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> refused to have anything to do with it, as Julius had threatened them with <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> if they did. The assembled <a href="12386b.htm">prelates</a> thereupon took fright and moved to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, so as to be under the protection of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. There they declared the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> deposed. Meanwhile Julius, whose ill health had caused delay, summoned the Fifth General Council of the Lateran to meet at <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1512, at the same time pronouncing the Synod of <a href="12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a> to be null and void. Xim&eacute;nez supported the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> throughout this affair, and his attitude doubtless went far towards preserving the <a href="15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a> in <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He also took an active part in procuring the publication of the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> convening the council.</p>

<p>Ferdinand died in 1516, having nominated Xim&eacute;nez to the regency pending the arrival of <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a> from <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. Adrian, dean of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, also claimed the appointment on the authority of a document previously signed by Charles. The jurists who were consulted decided in favour of Xim&eacute;nez, but he magnanimously proposed that he and Adrian should act jointly until further instructions should be received from Charles. Suspecting that the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> would be more acceptable to the Spanish people than a foreigner like Adrian, Charles confirmed Xim&eacute;nez in the regency, whilst Adrian was consoled with the Bishopric of <a href="14784c.htm">Tortona</a> and the post of Grand Inquisitor of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. The important position of regent gave full scope to the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> powers of administration and his solicitude for the peace and security of the kingdom. Jealousy and intrigues amongst the grandees, detrimental to order in the state, <a href="03459a.htm">caused</a> him to transfer the seat of government from Guadalupe to <a href="09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, as being more central, and his choice of a capital was confirmed by subsequent sovereigns. Whilst acting as regent he greatly improved the condition of both army and navy, and he forced several rebellious cities and <a href="07762a.htm">individuals</a> to acknowledge his authority as Charles's representative. He initiated a new system of taxation and brought about various other internal reforms. His diplomacy successfully prevented a proposed alliance between <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a> which would have been detrimental to Castile, and when Jean d'Albret, the exiled king of <a href="10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, endeavoured to recover his lost kingdom, Xim&eacute;nez joined forces with <a href="06207a.htm">Francis I of France</a> and defeated him. Both as regent during the absence of Charles and previously as guardian of Queen Juana, his wisdom and rectitude as well as his strength of character did much towards maintaining the integrity of the Spanish Throne. He took a prominent part in the efforts made for the spiritual welfare of the Spanish possessions in America and organized a band of missioners for the evangelization of the <a href="01409c.htm">New World</a>. <a href="04140a.htm">Columbus</a> had proved himself unfit to govern the newly-acquired territory by treating the conquered Indians as slaves, and this method of action called forth the severest condemnation from Xim&eacute;nez. After he became regent further information of slavery reached <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and he took strong measures to repress it. He drew up a code of instructions for the well-being of the natives and used every effort to shield them from oppression and convert them to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>.</p>

<p>Broken health and advancing age at length necessitated his retirement from public life, and his end is said to have been hastened by the ingratitude of <a href="03625a.htm">Charles V</a> for his many services to <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He was eighty-one when he died, and he was buried with great honours at <a href="01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>. Efforts were subsequently made for his <a href="02364b.htm">canonization</a>, but without result, though he has been <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint in many parts of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The greater part of his wealth he left to his beloved <a href="01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>. His character, which has been much misunderstood, was remarkable for its great versatility. He was as much a soldier as a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, as is shown by the share he took in the conquest of <a href="11266a.htm">Oran</a>. In his public life he was sternly conscientious, and fearless of the consequences to himself, in the performance of what he thought to be his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a>, whilst in private he carried his austerities and <a href="10578b.htm">mortifications</a> so far as to endanger his health. In <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a> he was above reproach and most exact in all the observances of his religious state.</p>

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The earliest lives of Xim&eacute;nez, on which almost all others have been based, are those of GOMEZ (Alcal&aacute;, 1569), ROBLES (Toledo, 1604), and QUINTANILLA (Palermo, 1633). Of the later ones the following deserve mention: FLECHIER, Hist. du Cardinal Xim&eacute;nez (Paris, 1700); BARRETT, Life of Cardinal Xim&eacute;nez (London, 1813); HEFELE, Der Cardinal Xim&eacute;nez (T&uuml;bingen, 1844), tr. DALTON (London, 1885). Further information may be found in: WADDING, Annales minorum, XV (Rome, 1736); IDEM, Script. ord. min. (Rome, 1806); JAMES, Lives of Eminent Foreign Statesmen, I (London, 1832); ROBERTSON, Life of Charles V (London, 1856); PRESCOTT, History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella (London, 1849), but in reading the last-mentioned two, allowance must be made for their Protestant prejudices.</p></div>
