<p>The capital of a province in Campania, southern <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and formerly capital of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies; it is situated on the northern side of the bay of Naples, on the Capodimonte, the Vomero, and the Posilipo hills, in one of the most enchanting spots upon the earth. The most populous town in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, its suburbs stretch along the bay, as far as Torre Annunziata.</p>

<p>Naples is a very industrial town, and its fisheries, navigation, and commerce are very active; commercially, it is the most important centre of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, after <a href="06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and contains an arsenal of the Royal Navy. In its neighbourhood, the vine and all species of esculent plants are cultivated; and fruits and vegetables are exported in great quantities. The silk industry is very important. Naples has frequently been damaged by the eruptions of the neighbouring Mt. Vesuvius; the most memorable of these occurred in the year 72 of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> era, the first eruption of Vesuvius after several centuries of inactivity; in 205, 407, 512, 982, and 1139, the eruptions were less violent; until 1631, the volcano gave no signs of activity, and was covered with vegetation; there were more or less violent eruptions, however, in 1680, 1694, 1707, 1723, 1794, 1804, 1805, 1822, 1828, 1839, 1850, and 1872; the eruption of 1904 was one of the most violent of all, and caused the ruin of Ottaiano and of San Giuseppe.</p>

<p>The Royal Palace, which ranks among the grandest of palaces on account of the majestic severity of its style, was begun in the early part of the seventeenth century by the viceroy Count of Lemos according to the designs of Domenico Fontana; it has a sumptuous interior, and contained valuable artistic collections, one of which, consisting of 40,000 engravings, is now at the Museo Nazionale. There is another royal palace at Capodimonte, built by Charles III, where there is a collection of arms and of modern <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a>; the Palace of the Prefecture is modern; S. Giacomo Palace, formerly the residence of the minister of State, now contains the municipal and other offices. The Capuan Castle, built by William I in 1131, and thereafter the residence of the Durazzos, of the sovereigns of the house of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, and of the viceroys, is now the court-house; the Castle of the Egg, also built by William I (1154), is at present a barrack and a fort, as are also Castel del Carmine and Castelnuovo, built by Charles I, and having a triumphal arch of Alfonso of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. Castel San Erasmo is a fort, situated upon a height commanding the city and the harbour. The museum of ancient art at Naples is one of the best of its kind in the world; its chief <a href="13641b.htm">sculptures</a>, the Hercules, the Farnese <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a>, and others, are from the collections of the Farnese <a href="05782a.htm">family</a>, and it possesses many interesting objects found in the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum, frescos and <a href="10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, among others; it contains also rich collections of cameos, <a href="11152a.htm">coins</a>, and inscriptions (Neapolitan <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a>), besides a gallery of pictures. At S. Martino, a former <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, there is a collection of <a href="11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Neapolitan artists, which belonged, for the most part, to that <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The Filanzieri Museum and the Gallery of the Fondi palace should also be noted. The aquarium for the study of submarine animal life was established by the co-operation of several countries, among them, the <a href="15156a.htm">United States</a>. There is at Naples a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> founded in 1224, furnished with various scientific collections and with a <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of more than 250,000 volumes; the town has a <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> institute, a nautical institute, and many intermediate <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>. The National Library has nearly 390,000 volumes, and the Brancacciana Library more than 115,000 volumes. The State Archives are very important. Nearly all of the great <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of the ancient Kingdom of Naples built sumptuous palaces, the private monumental architecture of Naples antedating that of Florence. Naples has more than 60 <a href="03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, some of which date from the thirteenth century, as, for example, the boarding-school of <a href="05386a.htm">St. Eligius</a> (1273), accommodating 300 young girls; the Casa Santa dell' Annunziata (1304); the boarding-school del Carmelo (1611), for 300 girls; and St. Januarius of the Poor (1669). Few ancient monuments are to be found at Naples; there is the piercing of the Posilipo ridge (crypta neapolitana), 815 yards in length, done by one Cocceius, probably under <a href="14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, and there are the ruins of villas of the ancient city, of a theatre and some <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a>; there is also the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Vergil on the <a href="12331a.htm">Pozzuoli</a> road.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Naples was founded by Greeks from Cum&aelig;, and Cum&aelig;, according to Mommsen, is the Pal&aelig;opolis to which Livy refers as existing not far from Naples and as being allied with the latter city against the Samnites. Naples, also, was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to receive the Samnites within its walls and to give to them participation in the government of the city, which explains her ambiguous conduct towards <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the Samnite War (325 B. C.). In its alliance with <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Naples furnished only ships. During the Punic War, the town so strongly fortified that Hannibal did not venture to attack it. When Roman citizenship was offered to Naples, the latter accepted, on condition that it should retain its language and its municipal institutions; and consequently, even in the time of Tacitus, Naples was a Greek city, to which those Romans who wished to devote themselves to the study of <a href="12025c.htm">philosophy</a> betook themselves by preference. In the games, called Sebasta, celebrated at Naples every five years, <a href="10752c.htm">Nero</a> once appeared. In 476, the last Emperor of the West was relegated to this city. The capture of Naples by Belisarius, in the Gothic War, when he entered the city through the tube of the aqueduct (536), is famous. Totila re-captured the town in 543, but the battle of Mt. Vesuvius decided the fate of the <a href="11347d.htm">Goths</a>, and Naples came under the Byzantine power, receiving a <em>dux</em> who depended on the Exarch of <a href="12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>; and that condition remained, even after the invasion of the Lombards. In 616, the <em>dux</em> Cousinus attempted to establish his independence, but the <a href="05676b.htm">exarch</a> Eleutherius defeated and killed him in the following year. A hundred years later, at the instance of the <a href="07620a.htm">iconoclast</a>, Leo the Isaurian, Exhileratus moved upon <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assassinate <a href="06787a.htm">Pope St. Gregory II</a>, but he was compelled to turn back, and was killed by the infuriated people. From that time on, the Byzantine rule at Naples was merely nominal; in place of a <em>dux</em>, there was frequently a consul in command of the city, which flourished in wealth, and displayed military virtues in the defence of its independence against the Lombard dukes of <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, <a href="14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, <a href="03319a.htm">Capua</a>, and <a href="13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, and also against the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; in 850, however, the town was nearly taken by Duke Sico of <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. The consul Sergius drove the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> from the island of Ponza, while his son C&aelig;sarius, in 846, went to the assistance of <a href="09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> against the same foe, and in 852, freed <a href="06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>; but to save their commerce, the Neapolitans thereafter allied themselves with the <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>. Bishop <a href="02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> II <a href="12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Sergius and proclaimed himself duke, but following the same friendly policy towards the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, he was <a href="05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a>.</p>

<p>In the eleventh century, Pandolfo of <a href="03319a.htm">Capua</a> succeeded in taking possession of Naples, but, assisted by the Norman Rainulf, Duke Sergius was able to return to that city (1029), and through gratitude, gave <a href="02151a.htm">Aversa</a> to his ally. In 1038 the Normans assisted the Byzantine general, Maniakis, in his <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> undertaking, and, indignant at being defrauded of their reward, turned their arms against the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>. Their subsequent conquests laid the foundation of what came to be the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, or the Kingdom of Naples. After their victory near Cann&aelig; in 1041, the Normans were masters of Calabria and Apulia, with the exception of the seaboard towns; their capital was established at Melfi, and the twelve counts divided the territory among themselves &mdash; its reconquest by the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> having been frustrated by the defection of Maniakis. In 1052, Argyros was again defeated, near Sipontum, and the troops of <a href="09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> were defeated near Civitella; whereupon the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the Normans in the possession of their conquests. The first count of Apulia whose title was recognized was William of the Iron Arm, who was succeeded by his brothers, Drogo (1046), assassinated at the instigation of the <a href="03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>; Humphrey; and, in 1057, Robert, called Guiscard, who by the capture of <a href="12717a.htm">Reggio</a> (1060), <a href="11351c.htm">Otranto</a> (1068), and <a href="02295a.htm">Bari</a> and <a href="02787e.htm">Brindisi</a> (1071), put an end to Byzantine rule in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>, while (1059) he obtained from <a href="11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> the title of Duke of Calabria, Apulia, and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, which island he had yet to conquer. On the other hand, he took the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, so that all his possessions and future conquests should be fiefs of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> acquired a new defender, especially against the empire, and also a new encumbrance. The conquest of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was accomplished by Roger, a brother of Robert, after a struggle of thirty years (1061-1091); the first city of the island that was taken from the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a> was <a href="10216a.htm">Messina</a>; Girgenti and <a href="14395b.htm">Syracuse</a> were among the last (1086-1087); the <a href="10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, however, were given the freedom of the country. Meanwhile, Robert conquered the Republic of <a href="01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> (1073) and the Duchy of <a href="13396b.htm">Salerno</a> (1077), the last remnant of the Lombard power. He attempted the conquest of Epirus in 1082, but died in 1085, contemplating a movement against <a href="15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Robert was succeeded by Roger I (1085-1111), William II (1111-1127), and then, Roger II, son of the conqueror of <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The latter, in 1098, had reduced Prince Richard of <a href="03319a.htm">Capua</a> to vassalage, and, it is said, obtained from <a href="15210a.htm">Urban II</a> the dignity of hereditary <a href="09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="10451a.htm">MONARCHIA SICULA</a>); and his son Roger II became duke of all those states, with Palermo for his capital. In 1130 the <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>, conferred upon him the title of king, confirmed by <a href="08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> (1139), to whom Roger renewed the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance. On the other hand, Naples under its duke, Sergius VII, had thrown open its gates to Roger, who extended his power in Epirus and Greece (1142 sq.), and also in Africa (Tripoli and Bona, 1152). He gave new constitutions to his states, protected <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>, promoted agriculture and the industries, especially the silk and textile branches, and during his reign <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> increased in population. His successor William the Wicked (1154) became a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of Matteo Bonellocapo, one of the conspiring barons, but was freed by the people. William the Good (1166-89) conquered Durazzo and Saloniki. His heiress was his aunt, <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, who married <a href="07233a.htm">Henry VI</a>, the future Emperor of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. As this was contrary to the wishes of the people and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, who desired the kingdom to be independent of the empire, Tancred was acclaimed king.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Tancred, an <a href="07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> offspring of the royal house, was soon succeeded by his son William III. Henry VI triumphed in 1194, and was <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Palermo, in which city he died (1197), leaving as his heir the infant Frederick I (the II of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>), whose tutelage was entrusted by Constance to <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. In the long contest for the succession of the empire, <a href="08013a.htm">Innocent</a> finally permitted Frederick to occupy both thrones, on condition that the two Governments should remain separate and independent of each other, and that, at the death of Frederick, the two crowns should not be inherited by the same prince. These conditions were not fulfilled, and the long struggle between the emperor and the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> arose, made all the more bitter by the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usurpations of Frederick. Conrad and Conradin continued the struggle, as did King Manfred, a natural son of Frederick, whom the latter made administrator, but who reigned in reality as sovereign. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (<a href="08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, <a href="04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>, and <a href="15212a.htm">Urban IV</a>) as suzerain of the kingdom, offered it to whoever would free the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> of the domination of the Swabians; and Charles of Anjou, a brother of St. Louis, King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, offered himself. Manfred perished in the battle of <a href="02477b.htm">Benevento</a> (1266), and Conradin, after his defeat at Tagliacozzo, was taken to Naples and executed in the Piazza del Mercato (1268). Naples then became the capital of the kingdom, to which, however, Peter III of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> laid claim on account of his marriage to a daughter of Manfred. The people, who could not endure French rule, opened the way for him by the <a href="15384a.htm">Sicilian Vespers</a> (1282), and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> remained under the power of the <a href="03410b.htm">Aragonese</a>; but, under James, second son of Peter, it became an independent kingdom. When the former was called to the throne of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> (1295) he wished to restore <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> to Charles II, but a brother of James, <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, was acclaimed king by the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilians</a>, and Charles, although several times victorious, was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> at the peace of Caltabellotta (1302) to recognize Frederick as King of Trinacria. Frederick was succeeded by Peter II (1336), Louis (1342), and Frederick III (1355-77), who were continually at <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with Naples, and always under the domination of the two parties into which the nobility was divided, the National and the Catalonian. Mary, daughter and heiress of Frederick, was married to Martin, son of the King of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, who re-united <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> to that realm in 1410, and was succeeded by Alfonso V (1416-58). The throne of Naples had been inherited by Robert the Wise (1309-1343), whom the <a href="07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> of <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> regarded as their leader, and who aspired to the conquest of the Italian peninsula. He was succeeded by his daughter, Joanna I, who was married four times, and the first of whose husbands, Andrew of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, was brutally <a href="07441a.htm">murdered</a> in 1345. Louis of <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> came to avenge his brother's death, and drove Joanna from Naples; but he was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to his country, and after a long <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> Joanna was restored (1352). Having no children, she adopted as her heir Louis of Anjou, a brother of Charles V, King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. This action led Charles of <a href="05209a.htm">Durazzo</a> to declare <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> upon Joanna, in which he received the support of <a href="15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>; the queen was killed (1382), and Louis, also, having died (1384), the throne was left to Charles without a contestant, but Charles died in <a href="07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in 1386.</p>

<p>Many who were dissatisfied with the regency for Ladislaus I, the minor son and heir of Charles, called to the throne Louis (II) of Anjou, also a minor, and thereby gave rise to a new <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> between the Durazzo and the Angevin parties. Ladislaus was victorious (1400) and sought to restore to Naples its preponderance in <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>; in this attempt, he invaded the <a href="14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, and entered <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself (1408 and 1410). His successor was Joanna II (1414-1434), who was noted for the perversity of her life. Louis III (of Anjou) declared <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against her in 1420, on which account she adopted Alfonso V, son of Ferdinand of <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a> and <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; but as that prince wished the immediate possession of the kingdom, Joanna adopted Louis III, and after his death in 1434 his brother, Ren&eacute;. The latter, assisted by Filippo Visconti, defeated the <a href="13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> fleet of Alfonso near Ponza, in 1435; Alfonso himself was taken <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but was soon set at liberty, and received even the assistance of Filippo to conquer Naples, which he accomplished in 1442, establishing Spanish rule in that kingdom, which he left in 1458 to his <a href="07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son, Ferdinand, while <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> remained united to <a href="03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. Ferdinand refused to pay tribute to the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, his suzerain, usurped <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a>, violated boundaries, and in other ways provoked the displeasure of the barons of the kingdom and of <a href="08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>; the latter, therefore, gave his support to the barons, who revolted (1484-87), but Lorenzo de' Medici restored harmony to the state. Scarcely had Alfonso II ascended the throne (1494), when Charles VIII, wishing to maintain the <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> which he claimed to inherit from the house of Anjou to the throne of Naples, undertook his famous expedition into <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Alfonso II, knowing the <a href="07149b.htm">hatred</a> in which he was held, abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinand II; vainly, however, for almost without striking a blow, Charles became master of the kingdom. His success was but transitory, and Ferdinand was able to return to Naples in 1496, leaving the principal ports of the Adriatic coast in the hands of the <a href="15333a.htm">Venetians</a>. By the Treaty of Granada, Ferdinand the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Louis XII divided the Kingdom of Naples between themselves at the expense of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, who had succeeded Ferdinand, and whose territory they invaded. There soon arose contentions between the two invaders with the result that Gonzalvo de Cordova drove the French from <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> (battle of Cerignola, 1503), and Naples thereafter was governed by Spanish viceroys. In 1528, the French general Lautrec had reached the walls of Naples, when Andrew Doria suddenly passed over with his fleet to the side of the <a href="14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, who remained masters of the country. There were a great many insurrections against Spanish rule; in 1547, on account of the attempt to introduce the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>; in 1599, at the instigation of <a href="03221b.htm">Tommaso Campanella, O.P.</a>; in 1647 (Giuseppe d'Allessio at <a href="10216a.htm">Messina</a>, and Masaniello at Naples) it was proposed to offer the crown to Duke Henry of <a href="07074a.htm">Guise</a>; in 1674, there was a revolt at <a href="10216a.htm">Messina</a>; all of these insurrections were suppressed.</p>

<p>In the <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> of the Spanish succession, Naples was conquered by the Austrians for Charles III, son of Emperor Leopold, and pretender to the throne of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>; later, he became emperor as Charles VI. At the peace of <a href="15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> (1713), <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was given to King Amadeus of <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, but in 1720, it was reunited to Naples. In 1734 Charles of Bourbon, son of Duke Philip of <a href="11505a.htm">Parma</a>, assisted by the Spanish general Montemar, conquered Naples without much difficulty and took the name of Charles III; the Austrians attempted in the following year to retrieve their loss, but were defeated at <a href="11346a.htm">Velletri</a>. Charles introduced many reforms, several, however, to the disadvantage of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> (Tannucci ministry), and consequently he had difficulties with the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> which were not entirely cleared away by the concordat of 1755. When Charles ascended the throne of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he left Naples to his third son Ferdinand IV (1759-1825). Having failed to drive the French from the <a href="14257a.htm">Papal States</a> in 1798, Ferdinand was compelled to withdraw to <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; the French invaded Naples, and in January, 1799, proclaimed the Parthenopian Republic. The kingdom was soon restored, however, through the efforts of Cardinal <a href="05745a.htm">Fabricius</a> Ruffo Scilla. In 1806, Naples was again conquered by Joseph Bonaparte, who became its king; upon ascending the throne of <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he was succeeded at Naples by Murat, who was dethroned and killed in 1815. In 1820-21 sectarian agitations brought about an insurrection; the king gave a constitution, but was compelled by <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> to withdraw it, and with Austrian assistance, returned to the throne (1821). Under Francis I (1825) and Ferdinand II (1830-59), conspirators maintained their activity, especially in 1848 and 1849, when <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a> again attempted to sever its union with Naples. Cavour gave his support to the expedition of Garibaldi against Francis II. Garibaldi landed at Marsala on 11 May, 1860, and soon conquered <a href="13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; he then passed over to Calabria, and on 7 September, took Naples. After the battle of Volturno (1 October), the regular troops of <a href="12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> entered the Kingdom of Naples, and King Francis withdrew to <a href="06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, where, after a <a href="06147a.htm">brave</a> resistance, he capitulated on 12 February, 1861, and signed the annexation of his dominions to the <a href="08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>.</p>

<p>According to a legend connected with the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter <em>ad aram</em>, the Apostle on his way to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Naples St. Asprenus, a brother of St. Candida, who had given hospitality to St. Peter. This St. Candida, however, is probably the one who lived in the sixth century and whose metrical epitaph is preserved. At all events, it was natural that <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> should be taken to Naples at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>, especially among the Hebrews, since that city was in the neighbourhood of <a href="12331a.htm">Pozzuoli</a> (<a href="../bible/act028.htm#vrs13">Acts 28:13</a>), and the <a href="03417b.htm">catacombs</a> of St. Januarius, St. Severus, and St. Gaudiosus show that there was a considerable number of <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> at Naples in the beginning of the second century. Hence the establishment of the <a href="05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> may date from that time, as there is record of only nine <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> prior to 300, the first of them being Asprenus; the sixth, St. Agrippinus, suffered <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, possibly under <a href="15256b.htm">Valerian</a>; the <a href="04647c.htm">deacons</a> Marianus and Rufus, also, were <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a>. Bishop St. Maximus was exiled by Constantius on account of the <a href="12386b.htm">prelate's</a> firm catholicity (357?). At the close of the fourth century, the <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> were still numerous, and the <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> Symmachus calls Naples <em>urbs religiosa</em> (Epist. I, VIII, 27). The first removal of the body of <a href="08295a.htm">St. Januarius</a> from <a href="12331a.htm">Pozzuoli</a> to Naples took place under Bishop Severus (367); Bishop St. Nostrianus (about 450) fought against <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> and during his incumbency, St. Gaudiosus, fleeing from the persecutions of the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandals</a> in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, landed at Naples, and died there. Bishop Demetrius was deposed by <a href="06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (593), who appointed to the See of Naples the Roman Fortunatus; the <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a> of Bishop St. Angelus (671-91) saved the city from the invasion of the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; Sergius, before he became <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 716, was famous for having retaken the castle of Cuma from the Lombards. St. Paul I (762), a friend of <a href="11577a.htm">Pope Paul I</a>, was prevented from taking possession of his <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the <a href="07620a.htm">iconoclast</a> <em>dux</em>; St. Tiberius (818) died in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>, in which he was confined because of his condemnation of the wickedness of the consul Bonus; St. Athanasius I (850) was <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by his nephew, the <em>dux</em> Sergius, and died on a journey to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (872). Anastasius II, a cousin of Sergius, having become <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, captured the <em>dux</em>, blinded him, and made himself Duke of Naples, and by favouring the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, incurred <a href="05678a.htm">excommunication</a> by <a href="08423c.htm">John VIII</a>. The first Neapolitan <a href="12386b.htm">prelate</a> to bear the title of <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was Sergius (990-1005), and his successors continued to be <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, even after Leo the Isaurian had made all of Byzantine <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> dependent on the <a href="11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople; their <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> was in part Latin, and in part Greek. Under Archbishop Anselm (1192-1215), there was incorporated into the Diocese of Naples that of Cuma, where, in the time of <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, Maxentius was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the <a href="04647c.htm">deacon</a> Maximus was <a href="09736b.htm">martyred</a>. Another <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Cuma was the Misenus who went in 483, with Vitalis and Felix, on a pontifical mission to Constantinople, where he betrayed the <a href="12260a.htm">pope's</a> interests. This city was destroyed by the Neapolitans in 1207, but many of its ruins are still in existence.</p>

<p>Other <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Naples are Cardinal Henry Minutolo (1389), a liberal restorer of churches; Nicol&ograve; de Diano (1418), <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the maintenance of discipline and of good <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>; between 1458 and 1575, seven <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of the <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of Caraffa succeeded each other, with only one interruption; among them was Giovanni Pietro (1549-1555), who became <a href="11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a>. This series was followed in 1576 by Blessed Paul Burali, a <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and one of the associates of <a href="03145a.htm">St. Cajetan of Tiene</a> who died at Naples in 1547; <a href="01540d.htm">Cardinal Annibale</a> da Capua (1578), who, like his predecessor, was a reformer; Cardinal Alfonso Gesualdo (1596); Cardinal Ottavio Acquaviva (1604) and Francesco Boncompagni (1626) were distinguished, the one for his benevolence, and the other for his charity on the occasion of the eruption of Mt.
