<p>(Also, <em>Huldreich</em>)</p>

<p>Founder of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, born at Wildhaus in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 1 January, 1484; died 11 October, 1531. Zwingli came from a prominent <a href="05782a.htm">family</a> of the middle classes, and was the third of eight sons. His father Ulrich was a district official of the little town of Wildhaus, and a cousin of his mother, Margaret Meili, was <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Fischingen in Thurgau. A brother of the elder Zwingli, Bartholomew, was <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Wildhaus until 1487, but then became <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> and dean of Wesen on the Walensee. Zwingli received his early <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> at Wesen under the guidance of this uncle, by whom he was sent, at the age of ten, to Gregory Bunzli of Wesen who was studying at Basle and also teaching in the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Theodore, which Zwingli henceforth attended. For his higher studies he went to <a href="02507b.htm">Berne</a>, whither the celebrated <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Humanist Schuler was attracting many students for Classical studies. Zwingli's name is entered on the roll of the <a href="15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a> for the winter term of 1498-99, but he was excluded from the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. The reason for his exclusion is unknown. Zwingli appears, however, to have overcome the difficulty, for he was again matriculated in 1500. Two years later he returned to Basle, where, among others, Thomas Wyttenbach encouraged him to devote himself to the serious study of <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In 1506 he completed his studies and received the degree of Master of Theology. Shortly before his graduation the <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> of Glarus had selected him as its <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a>, although he had not yet been <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>. Apart from his exclusion from the <a href="15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>, his student life presents no unusual features, though his later friends and followers relate much that is laudatory about this period. His studies at <a href="02507b.htm">Berne</a>, <a href="15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and Basle, where <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a> was eagerly cultivated, made Zwingli one of its <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> supporters.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>As <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Glarus from 1506 to 1516, the continuation of his <a href="07538b.htm">humanistic</a> studies was one of Zwingli's chief occupations. He studied Greek, read the Classics and the <a href="06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, and entered into familiar intercourse with the Humanists of the time, especially with <a href="06577a.htm">Heinrich Loriti (Glareanus)</a>, <a href="05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, and Vadian. He also engaged in teaching, and the later chroniclers Aegidius and Valentine Tschudi were his pupils. In public life he was chiefly conspicuous for his political activity, in this respect following the example of many <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of his day. In the Italian campaigns of 1513 and 1515, when the <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> won the victories of <a href="11134b.htm">Novara</a> and Marignan, he acted as army <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. His earliest literary attempts &#151; the rhymed fables of the ox (about 1510), "De Gestis inter Gallos et Helvetios relatio" (1512), "The Labyrinth" (1516?) &#151; are all concerned with politics. These works, which reveal Zwingli as the devoted adherent and champion of the <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> party, won him the friendship of the powerful <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a> Matthew Schinner and an annual pension of fifty gulden from the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. So <a href="15753a.htm">zealously</a> indeed did he then espouse the cause of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> that his position in Glarus became untenable when the French party became predominant there in 1516. Diebold von Geroldseck, the administrator and sole conventual in the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, entrusted him with the position of a <a href="13675a.htm">secular priest</a> there, and at the end of 1516 Zwingli left Glarus.</p>

<p>As <a href="13675a.htm">secular priest</a> at <a href="05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, the celebrated place of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> for <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and South <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Zwingli's chief office was that of preacher. For the fulfilment of this task he devoted himself to the study of <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a>, copied the <a href="05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and learned Hebrew, but did not meanwhile neglect the Classics, a fact which won him flattering praise from the Humanists. <a href="05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> was keenly aware of the laxity of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life (the abuses in external worship, the degeneracy of a large proportion of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>), and rightly agitated a reform within the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, impressing its necessity on the <a href="07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. Zwingli worked in the same spirit at <a href="05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> from 1516 to 1518. In disputing <a href="09438b.htm">Luther's</a> priority, Zwingli later claimed (and most historians have supported his claim) that while at <a href="05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> he already preached against the old Faith. His claim is, however, negatived by the facts that he continued to draw his pension, that at the end of 1518, at his own petition, he was appointed by the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="01106a.htm">acolyte</a> <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman See</a> (cf. the document in "Analecta reformatoria", I, 98), and that his friendly intercourse with Cardinal Schinner still continued when he was engaged at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a> in 1519.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1518, when the post of secular preacher at M&uuml;nster became <a href="15248b.htm">vacant</a>, Zwingli applied for the vacancy at the invitation of Oswald Myconius (a friend of his youth), who was engaged as teacher in the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of that place. Like many other <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, Zwingli was suspected of offences against <a href="03481a.htm">celibacy</a>. These reports, which were current even in <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, made his position there difficult. When his friend Myconius questioned him on this point Zwingli wrote from <a href="05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> that it was not, as had been asserted, a respectable girl, but a common strumpet with whom he had been intimate. His friends in Zurich succeeded in suppressing these reports, and on 11 Dec., 1518, the chapter elected Zwingli by a great majority. He was then thirty-five years old, "in body a handsome and vigorous <a href="11726a.htm">person</a>, fairly tall, and of a friendly aspect". In his intercourse with others he was an agreeable companion, of pleasant address and gay temperament, a good singer and musician, and a skilled orator. Accused by his contemporaries of no slight moral offences, he made no attempt to clear himself of the charges. As a scholar he was a Humanist rather than a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>. Under the influence of <a href="05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, he saw clearly the defects of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life, but could not himself claim to be spotless, and his talents led him to engage rather in disputes concerning secular affairs than to devote himself to <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> reforms. So far he had no intention of introducing <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> innovations; such an <a href="07630a.htm">idea</a> occurred to him first in Zurich after 1519. <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> had already hung up his ninety-five theses against <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> at the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of the castle in <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, 31 Oct., 1517.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>On 1 January, 1519, Zwingli preached for the first time in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. He began with the exposition of the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, taking first the Gospel of St. Matthew, and by going back to the sources showed himself especially a Humanist. Of <a href="05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> innovation he had still scarcely any thought. Even his stand against the <a href="07783a.htm">indulgence</a> preacher, Bernhardin Sanson, at the beginning of 1519, was taken with the consent of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>. The transformation of Zwingli the Humanist and politician into a teacher of the new <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> was facilitated by the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political conditions of the people and public authorities at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a> and in <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in general. The populace displayed great religious <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> externally, e.g., in <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a> foundations and <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>. This <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>, however, was insufficient to counteract the decay of <a href="10559a.htm">morals</a>, which resulted especially from the mercenary army system. The <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> to a great extent neglected their <a href="11189a.htm">obligations</a>, many of them lived in <a href="04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, and joined in the shameless pursuit of spiritual <a href="12371a.htm">prebends</a>, thus damaging their prestige. Worthy <a href="04049b.htm">clerics</a>, however, were not wanting. The <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Hugo von Hohenlandenberg, was a man of stainless conduct; he endeavoured to do away with abuses, and issued various mandates, but unfortunately without permanent results. This failure was due to the lack of cooperation on the part of the civil rulers, who then enjoyed in <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters very extensive <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> acquired, especially by Zurich and Berne, from the <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in consequence of the <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundian</a>, Swabian, and <a href="10298a.htm">Milanese</a> <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> (1474-1516). <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, like <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, had endeavoured to secure, by the outlay of much money, the services of <a href="14358a.htm">Swiss</a> mercenaries. In Zurich, the "foremost and supreme place", the council espoused the cause of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>, and opposed the French party. Zwingli did the same and came into prominence first as a politician, a fact which makes his case essentially different from that of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>. It was only in 1520 that he <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> renounced his <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> pension. He then attacked the ruinous mercenary system, and through his efforts Zurich alone of all the cantons refused to enter the alliance with <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> on 5 May, 1521. However, 2000 mercenaries entered the service of the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. On 11 Jan., 1522, all foreign services and pensions were forbidden in <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. By the publication, 16 May, 1522, of his "Vermahnung an die zu Schwyz, dass sie sich vor fremden Herren hutend", Zwingli succeeded in extending his influence beyond Zurich, although only temporarily.</p>

<p>Owing to his success as a politician his prestige and importance increased. From 1522 he came forward as sponsor of the religious innovations. His first reformatory work, "Vom Erkiesen und Fryheit der Spysen", appeared when the bookseller Froschauer and his associates publicly defied the ecclesiastical law of <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and a controversy concerning <a href="05789c.htm">fasts</a> broke out. Zwingli declared the <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a> provisions mere human commands which were not in harmony with <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a>; and the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> was the sole source of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, as he asserted in his second writing, "Archeteles". Through the medium of a delegation the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> exhorted the town to obedience on 7 April. On 29 Jan., 1523, the council, on whose decision everything depended, held a religious disputation at Zwingli's instigation, and agreed to base its action on the result of the debate. In sixty-seven theses (his most extensive and important work) Zwingli now proposed a formal programme for the innovations; according to his view the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> with his interpretation was to be the sole authority. The arguments brought against this view by the most important champion of the old Faith, the <a href="15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> Johann Faber of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a>, who appealed to the teaching and tradition of the early Church, were disregarded; the council in whose hands Zwingli reposed the government of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, forthwith declared in favour of the innovation.</p>

<p>A second religious disputation in October, 1523, dealt with the practical institution of a state church, the veneration of the <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>, the removal of images, <a href="06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="01115a.htm">works</a>, and the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. No notable representative of the ancient Faith was present. Zwingli urged the adoption of his doctrines so successfully that even his devoted adherent, Commander Schmid of Kusnacht, warned him against the too sudden abolishment of ancient customs and usages. The first steps having been taken in 1522-23, the reforms were carried into effect in Zurich in 1524-25. About <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1524, <a href="07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> were abolished, the <a href="13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of Penance and Extreme Unction rejected, and pictures, <a href="13641b.htm">statues</a>, <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a>, altars, and organs destroyed, regardless of their artistic value. <a href="01357e.htm">Sacred vessels</a> of great value, such as <a href="03561a.htm">chalices</a> and <a href="11344a.htm">monstrances</a>, were melted into coin. <a href="12466a.htm">Church property</a> was seized by the State, which gained most by the suppression of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; the Fraum&uuml;nster Abbey, founded in 853, was <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> surrendered to the <a href="02137c.htm">secular authorities</a> by the last <a href="01007e.htm">abbess</a>. <a href="03481a.htm">Celibacy</a> was rejected as contrary to <a href="../bible.html">Holy Writ</a>, and <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> were married. As early as 1522 Zwingli with ten other <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> assembled at <a href="05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> and addressed a petition to the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> and to the diet asking freedom for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> to marry. "Your honourable wisdom", they declared, "has already witnessed the disgraceful and shameful life we have unfortunately hitherto led with <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, thereby giving grievous <a href="13506d.htm">scandal</a> to everyone." From 1522 the marriage of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> in Zurich became ever more frequent; Zwingli himself on 2 July, 1524, married Anna Reinhard (the <a href="15617c.htm">widow</a> of Hans Meyer* von Knonau), who bore him his first daughter on 31 July. A new marriage law of 10 May, 1525, regulated these innovations. In the spring of 1525 the Mass was abolished; in its place was introduced the memorial service of the Last Supper.</p>

<p>The new doctrines were not introduced without opposition. The first opponents of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a> were from the ranks of their own party. The peasants could find no reason in the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, the sole principle of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, why they should contribute to their lords' taxes, <a href="14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and rent, and they refused any longer to do so. The greatest unrest prevailed everywhere, and was only quelled after long negotiations and some concessions by the Government. The <a href="01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> were not so easily silenced. From the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a>, which Zwingli had placed in their hands, they had <a href="04674a.htm">deduced</a> the most marvellous doctrines, much more radical than Zwingli's and questioning even the authority of the state. Zwingli <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them mercilessly with <a href="12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, torture, banishment and death; their leader Felix Manz was drowned. The <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against these visionary spirits was more serious for Zwingli than that against <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At first <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> allowed itself to be soothed by evasive words; the <a href="09458a.htm">"Lutheran sects"</a> were aimed at and the Zwinglians clung to the word of <a href="06608a.htm">God</a>, was the information supplied to <a href="04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> by <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a> on 19 August, 1524. Soon, however, the breach with the ancient <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> was too plain to be <a href="05141a.htm">doubted</a>. The cantons of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, <a href="09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, Zug, and Fribourg remained true to the old <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and offered determined opposition to Zwingli. They could not see that Zwingli was more favoured by <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> than the ancient <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> and teachers; in his <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> life he was not superior to others, and he was inclined rather towards disturbance than towards peace.</p>

<p>The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons, however, also strove to abolish abuses, issuing in 1525 a Concordat of Faith with important reforms which, however, never found general recognition. From 21 May to 8 June, 1526, they held a public disputation at <a href="02194a.htm">Baden</a>, to which they invited <a href="05271b.htm">Dr. Johann Eck</a> of Ingolstadt. Zwingli did not venture to appear. The disputation ended with the complete victory for the old <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a>, but those who believed that the teaching of Zwingli could be driven out of the world by disputations deceived themselves; it had already taken too deep root. In St. Gall the Humanist and burgomaster Vadian worked successfully in Zwingli's interest &#151; in Schaffhausen, Dr. Sebastian Hofmeister; in Basle, (Ecolampadius. For Berne which, notwithstanding the efforts of Berchtold Haller, had previously maintained a non-committal attitude, the religious disputation held at Zwingli's suggestion, in Jan., 1528, was decisive. Zwingli himself came to the city, and the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause was but weakly represented. The new doctrines were then introduced as sweepingly into <a href="02507b.htm">Berne</a> as they had been at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, and many places and counties which had previously wavered followed its example. Zwingli could also point to brilliant successes in 1528 and 1529. He ensured the predominance of his reforms through the "Christian Civic rights", agreed upon between Zurich and the towns of <a href="04286c.htm">Constance</a> (1527), <a href="02507b.htm">Berne</a> and St. Gall (1528), Biel, Mulhausen, and Schaffhausen (1529). To compel the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons to accept the new doctrines, he even urged civil <a href="15546c.htm">war</a>, drew up a plan of campaign, and succeeded in persuading Zurich to declare <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> and march against the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> territories. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts had endeavoured to strengthen their position by forming a defensive alliance with <a href="02121b.htm">Austria</a> (1529), the "Christian Union." At this juncture, however, they received no assistance. Berne showed itself more moderate than Zurich, and a treaty of peace was arranged, which, however, was very unfavourable for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In Zurich Zwingli was now the commanding <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> in all <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political questions. He was "burgomaster, secretary, and council" in one, and showed himself daily more overbearing. His insolence indeed prevented an agreement with <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> regarding the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Lord's Supper, when a disputation was arranged between the two heresiarchs at Marfurt in October, 1529. As a statesman, Zwingli embarked in secular politics with ambitious plans. "Within three years", he writes, "Italy, <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> will take our view". Even the King of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, whose greatest enemy he had previously been, he sought to win to his side in 1531 with the work "Christianae fidei expositio", and was even prepared to pay him a yearly pension. By prohibiting intercourse with the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons he compelled them to resort to arms. On 9 Oct., 1531, they declared <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> on Zurich, and advanced to Kappel on the frontiers. The people of <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a> hastened to oppose them, but met a decisive defeat near Kappel on 11 Oct., Zwingli falling in the battle. After a second defeat of the Reformed forces at Gubel, peace was concluded on 23 Oct., 1531. The peace was of long duration, since the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> victors displayed great moderation. Zwingli's death was an event of great importance for all <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. His plan to introduce his innovations into the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons by force had <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> abortive. But even <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who claimed the same <a href="13055c.htm">rights</a> in religious matters as the people of <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, regarded him as the "governor of all confederates". Zwingli is regarded as the most "liberal" of all the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, and was less a dogmatist than <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a>. His <a href="13641b.htm">statue</a>, with a sword in one hand and the <a href="../bible.html">Bible</a> in the other, stands near the municipal <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, which has also a Zwingli museum.</p>

<p>Heinrich Bullinger (1504-75), Zwingli's successor, undertook the internal development of the new doctrines. His father (also named Heinrich) who was <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Bremgarten and embraced the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> early, sent Bullinger to Emmerich and Cologne, where he received a thorough Humanistic training. Even from his earliest activity as teacher in the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Kappel (1523-29) and later as <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> in Bremgarten (1529 31), Bullinger proved himself a <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> lieutenant of Zwingli's. In 1528 he accompanied the latter to the religious disputation at <a href="02507b.htm">Berne</a>. On 9 Dec., 1531, he was chosen as Zwingli's successor, <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the Grossm&uuml;nster at <a href="15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, a position which he held to the end of his life (1575). Bullinger regarded union with <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> on the question of the Lord's Supper as his chief task. For this purpose he composed in 1536, with Myconius and Grynaeus, the "First Helvetic Confession", a profession of <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> which was recognized by the Evangelical towns of <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In the same year also appeared the "Wittenberg Concordia". When Bullinger refused to subscribe to this agreement, which was brought about by <a href="03025d.htm">Butzer</a>, <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> burst out into abuse of Zwingli. The attempt to bring about an agreement between Bullinger and <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a> on this question at <a href="09040a.htm">Geneva</a> was more successful, the "Consensus Tigurinus" being concluded between them in 1545. As the expression of his personal religious conviction Bullinger composed the "Second Helvetic Confession", which was printed in 1566, and was recognized by all the Evangelical churches except that of Basle.</p>

<p>Besides discharging the office of preacher, Bullinger displayed great literary activity. He carried on a large correspondence with several <a href="04380a.htm">crowned</a> heads, with Lady Jane Grey in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>, Vadian, Graubundenn, and many others. More than 100 sermons and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises from his pen are known, as well as one drama, "Lucretia and Brutus". His "Diarium" and his extensive history of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> are still valuable. It is an undecided question how far his history is independent and how far a compilation of other writings. In character Bullinger was particularly hospitable, and many fugitives from <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> found refuge with him. Although less overbearing than Zwingli and <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>, he was still intolerant; he approved the execution of Servetus at <a href="09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. He died on 17 September, 1575.</p>

<p>Zwingli's works were first collected and published by his son-in-law, Rudolf Gwalter, and entitled: "Opera D. H. Zwingli vigilantissimi Tigurinae ecclesiae Antistitis, partim quidem ab ipso Latine conscripta, partim vero e vernaculo sermone in Latinum translata: omnia novissime recognita, et multis adiectis, quae hactenus visa non sunt" (4 fol. vols., Zurich, 1545; reprinted, 1581). The first complete edition was edited by Melchior Schuler and Johannes Schulthess (8 vols., Zurich, 1828-42). Volumes VII and VIII, containing Zwingli's correspondence, are especially important. A new edition of his complete works prepared by Emil Egli (d. 1908), George Finsler, and Walther Kohler is appearing in the "Corpus Reformatorum", LXXXVIII (Berlin, 1905); three volumes I, II, and VII, have already (1912) appeared.</p>
