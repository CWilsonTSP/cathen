<p>(NOTTINGHAMIEN)</p>

<p>One of the original twelve English dioceses created at the time of the <a href="16037d.htm">restoration of the hierarchy</a> by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1850 embraces the counties of Nottingham, Leicester, Derby, Lincoln, and Rutland, which were comprised in the old Midland District or vicariate, when at the request of James II in 1685, the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> divided <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> into four vicariates, the London, the Northern, the Midland, and the Western. Prior to 1840 when the number of <a href="15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> was increased from four to eight, the Midland District had consisted of fifteen counties. In 1850 Nottingham could count only twenty-four permanent missions, many of these little better than villages. For the most part they originated from chaplaincies which had through penal times been maintained by the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nobility and gentry, or had been founded independently by them. Among these there existed foundations of several <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. In Derbyshire the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had missions at Chesterfield and Spink Hill in Lincolnshire at Lincoln, <a href="02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and Market Rasen. The <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were settled in Leicester, the Fathers of Charity carried on several missions in Leicestershire, and the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> occupied their newly founded Abbey of Mount St. Bernard in Charnwood Forest.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>From the appearance of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in 1580 at the special request of Dr. Allen, they had done much by their devoted labours to keep alive the Faith in the Nottingham diocese. Of their missions mentioned above some were among the earliest of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> dating back some three hundred years. Derby was included in the district or college of the <a href="14081a.htm">Society</a> called the "Immaculate Conception", founded by Father Richard Blount, about 1633, first Provincial of the English Province. Extinct for many years it was partially revived in 1842 as Mount St. Mary's College, when the present college and convictus was established by the then provincial, Father Raudal Lythegoe. After the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, the English Province of the <a href="12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a> ceased to exist, until resuscitated at Bornhem in <a href="06094b.htm">Flanders</a> by <a href="07502c.htm">Philip Howard</a> later <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who became the first <a href="12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in 1675. The first introduction of the <a href="05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> from Bornhem was at Hinckley, whence for many years Leicester was served by them at intervals. Their mission at Leicester was put on a permanent basis only in 1798 by the purchase of a house by Father Francis Xavier Choppelle. The present church of the Holy Cross was begun by Father Benedict Caestrick in 1815 and was opened in 1819. The dedication under the title of Holy Cross was adopted no <a href="05141a.htm">doubt</a> on account of the celebrated <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Holy Cross brought from Bornhem, and now in <a href="09341a.htm">London</a>. After the lapse of three centuries a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> was resuscitated in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> by the foundation of the Abbey of Mount St. Bernard in Leicestershire, made possible by the assistance of <a href="04698c.htm">Ambrose Phillips de Lisle</a> of Grace Dieu Manor, who after his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a> in December, 1825, devoted all his energies to the spread of the Faith in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. This he hoped to accomplish by the re-establishment in the country of monastic institutions. In 1835 he purchased about two hundred and twenty-seven acres of wild uncultivated land in Charnwood Forest and presented it to the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. Beginning with one brother who lived alone in a four-roomed cottage, the community rapidly increased, and a larger building was erected as well as a small <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a>, opened by Dr. Walsh 11 October, 1837. This also in a short time proving insufficient, the Earl of <a href="13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a> generously offered them &pound;2,000, but on condition that a new <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> should be erected, choosing for that purpose the present site of the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>. It was built from designs by <a href="12558b.htm">Augustus Welby Pugin</a>. In 1848 by <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mount St. Bernard was raised to the dignity of an <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and Father Bernard, the first mitred <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> since the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 18 February, 1849. In introducing the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> into <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="04698c.htm">de Lisle</a> had hoped that they would undertake missionary work and with this view he had built three <a href="03574b.htm">chapels</a>, at Grace Dieu, Whitwick, and the <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a>. On the score of their rule, however, they declined to take charge permanently of the missions. <a href="04698c.htm">De Lisle</a> then decided to bring from <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> members of the Order of Charity. After much negotiation with the head of the order, Father Gentili came to Grace Dieu as <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. This was the commencement of the settlement of this order in the diocese. In 1841 Dr. Walsh made over to them the secular mission of Loughborough founded in 1832 by Father Benjamin Hulme. The buildings were too small to permit of a <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of their own which they were desirous to establish. To carry out this twofold object, about nine acres were purchased; here the foundation stone of the new buildings was laid in May, 1843, and in 1844 was opened the first college and <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> house of the institute in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> had come to Nottingham in 1844, and in 1846 entered their <a href="04340c.htm">convent</a> in close proximity to the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nottingham was the Rt. Rev. William Hendren, O.S.F., born in 1792, <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 10 September, 1848, as <a href="15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Western District, transferred to the <a href="04058c.htm">Diocese of Clifton</a>, 29 Sept., 1850, and to Nottingham, 22 June, 1851. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of St. Barnabas is of the lancet style of architecture, and is considered one of the best specimens of the work of <a href="12558b.htm">Augustus Welby Pugin</a>. Owing to ill-health Dr. Hendren resigned in 1853 and was succeeded by Dr. Richard Roskell, born at Gateacre near <a href="09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, in 1817. He was sent to <a href="15233b.htm">Ushaw</a> and afterwards to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he took his degree and was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1840. He was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by <a href="15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> on 21 September, 1853. During his episcopate a number of missions were founded in the various counties of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In Lincolnshire, through the generosity of Thomas Arthur Young of Kingerby Hall, not only was there a church and presbytery built at Gainsborough and Grimsby, but the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> order was re-introduced into <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> at Crowle and Spalding. In 1874, owing to Dr. Roskell's ill-health, the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed the Rev. Edward Gilpin Bagshawe of the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> Oratory his coadjutor. The same year, however, Dr. Roskell tendered his resignation and Dr. Bagshawe was <a href="04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at the <a href="09341a.htm">London</a> Oratory 12 November, 1874. Numerous missions necessitated by the development of the mining industry were opened during his administration, and various communities of <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a> introduced into the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which he ruled for twenty-seven years. He resigned in 1901 and in 1904 was transferred to the titular Archbishopric of <a href="13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>. Rt. Rev. Robert Brindle, D.S.O., his successor, was born at <a href="09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, 4 November, 1837. The first <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to receive the pension for distinguished and meritorious service, as well as <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> and <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> orders and medals, he was, his retirement from the army in 1899, on the petition of <a href="15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a>, appointed his assistant, and on the resignation of Dr. Bagshawe, received his <a href="03052b.htm">Brief</a> to the See of Nottingham 6 November, 1901.</p>

<p>In 1910 there were in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> 32,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 84 <a href="13675a.htm">secular</a>, and 44 regular, <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>; 75 <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> with missions attached, 31 without missions; 6 <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> for men, and 9 for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>.</p>
