<p>Egypt was the Motherland of <a href="10459a.htm">Christian monasticism</a>. It sprang into existence there at the beginning of the fourth century and in a very few years spread over the whole <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. The rapidity of the movement was only equalled by the durability of its results. Within the lifetime of St. Anthony the religious state had become what it has been ever since, one of the characteristics of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, with its ideals, and what may be termed the groundwork of its organization, determined. But this was not all. The simple teaching of the first <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> fixed once and forever the broad outlines of the <a href="13598b.htm">science</a> of the spiritual life, or, in other words, of <a href="14613a.htm">ascetic theology</a>. The study, therefore, of early monasticism possess a great deal more than a merely antiquarian interest. It is concerned with a movement the force of which is in no way spent and which has had a very large share in creating the conditions which obtain at the present day.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The first chapter in the history of monasticism is the life of St. Anthony which has already been described (see SAINT ANTHONY). The inauguration of the monastic movement may be dated either about 285, when St. Anthony, no longer content with the life of the ordinary ascetic, went into the wilderness, or about 305, when he organized a kind of monastic life for his disciples. <em>Ascetic</em> is the term usually employed by writers on monasticism for those who in pre-monastic days forsook the world so far as they were able. Of the three Evangelical counsels, chastity alone can be practised independently of external circumstances. Naturally, therefore (beginning with the sub-Apostolic age), we hear first of men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> leading the virgin life (cf. <a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle of Clement</em> 38</a>; Ignat., "ad Polucarp.", c.v.; Hermas, "Sim.", IX, 30).</p>

<p>The Apologists pointed triumphantly to such (<a href="08580c.htm">Justin</a>, "Apol.", I, xv; <a href="02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, <a href="../fathers/0205.htm"><em>A Plea for the Christians</em> 33</a>; <a href="10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a>, "Octav.", xxxi). Voluntary poverty, in the complete renunciation of all worldly possessions, would be difficult till there were <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, for <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> with wealth to renounce would not, generally speaking, have been brought up so as to be capable of earning their own livelihood. Still we have the examples of <a href="11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, and <a href="11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> to show that the thing was done. A full practice of the last Evangelical counsel (obedience) could only be realized after the monastic ideal had taken root and passed beyond the purely <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> stage. The ante-Nicene ascetic would be a man who led a single life, practised long and frequent <a href="05789c.htm">fasts</a>, abstained from flesh and wine, and supported himself, if he were able, by some small handicraft, keeping of what he earned only so much as was absolutely <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his own sustenance, and giving the rest to the poor. If he were an <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> man, he might be employed by the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in some such capacity as that of catechist. Very often he would don the kind of dress which marked the wearer off as a <a href="12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of an austere <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, at the time when St. Anthony first embraced the ascetic life, there were numbers of ascetics living in huts in the neighbourhood of the towns and villages. When St. Anthony died (356 or 357), two types of monasticism flourished in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. There were villages or colonies of <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a> - the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> type; and <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in which a community life was led - the cenobitic type. A brief survey of the opening chapters of <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius'</a> "Lausiac History" will serve as a description of the former type.</p>

<p>Palladius was a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> from Palestine who, in 388, went to <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to drink in the spirit of monasticism at the fountainhead. On landing at Alexandria he put himself in the hands of a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> named Isidore, who in early life had been a <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> at Nitria and now apparently presided over a hospice at Alexandria without in any way abating the austerity of his life. By the advice of Isidore, <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> placed himself under the direction of a <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> named Dorotheus who lived six miles outside Alexandria, with whom he was to pass three years learning to subdue his passions and then to return to Isidore to receive higher spiritual <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. This Dorotheus spent the whole day collecting stones to build cells for other <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a>, and the whole night weaving ropes out of palm leaves. He never lay down to sleep, though slumber sometimes overtook him while working or eating. <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> who seems to have lived in his cell, ascertained from other solitaries that this had been his custom from his youth upwards. <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius'</a> health broke down before he completed his time with Dorotheus, but he spent three years in Alexandria and its neighbourhood visiting the hermitages and becoming acquainted with about 2000 <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. From Alexandria he went to Nitria, where there was a monastic village containing about 5000 solitaries. There was no kind of monastic rule. Some of the solitaries lived alone, sometimes two or more lived together. They assembled at the church on Saturdays and <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. The church was served by eight <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> of whom the oldest always celebrated, preached, and judged, the others only assisting. All worked at weaving flax. There were bakeries where bread was made, not only for the village itself, but for the solitaries who lived in the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> beyond. There were <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a>. Wine also was sold.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Strangers were entertained in a guest-house. If able to read, they were lent a book. They might stay as long as they liked, but after a week they were set to some kind of work. If at the ninth hour a man stood and listened to the sound of psalmody issuing from the different cells, he would imagine, says <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, that he was caught up into <a href="14519a.htm">paradise</a>. But, though there was no monastic rule at Nitria, there was municipal law, the outward symbol of which was three whips suspended from three palm trees, one for <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> who might be guilty of some fault, one for thieves who might be caught prowling about, and the third for strangers who misbehaved. Further into the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> was a place called Cells, or Cellia, whither the more perfect withdrew. This is described by the author of the "Historia monachorum in Aegypto". Here the solitaries lived in cells so far apart that that they were out of sight and out of hearing from one another. Like those of Nitria, they met only on Saturdays and <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> at church, whither some of them had to travel a distance of three or four miles. Often their death was only discovered by their absence from church.</p>

<p>In strong contrast with the <a href="07761a.htm">individualism</a> of the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life was the rigid discipline which prevailed in the cenobitical <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> founded by <a href="11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a>. When, in 313, Constantine was at <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>, Pachomius, still a <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a>, was forcibly enlisted together with a number of other young men, and placed on board a ship to be carried down the Nile to Alexandria. At some town at which the ship touched, the recruits were overwhelmed with the kindness of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Pachomius at once resolved to be a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> and carried out his resolution as soon as he was dismissed from military service. He began as an ascetic in a small village, taking up his abode in a deserted temple of Serapis and cultivating a garden on the produce of which he lived and gave <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>. The fact that Pachomius made an old temple of Serapis his abode was enough for an ingenious theory that he was originally a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>. This view is now quite exploded.</p>

<p>Pachomius next embraced the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life and prevailed upon an old <a href="07280a.htm">hermit</a> named Palemon to take him as his disciple and share his cell with him. It may be noted that this kind of <a href="05029a.htm">discipleship</a>, which, as we have already seen, was attempted by <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, was a recognized thing among the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a>. Afterwards he left Palemon and founded his first <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Tabennisi near Denderah. Before he died, in 346, he had under him eight or nine large <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of men, and two of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>. From a secular point of view, a Pachomian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was an industrial community in which almost every kind of trade was practised. This, of course, involved much buying and selling, so the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> had ships of their own on the Nile, which conveyed their agricultural produce and manufactured goods to the market and brought back what the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> required. From the spiritual point of view, the Pachomian <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> was a religious living under a rule more severe, even when allowance has been made for differences of climate and race, than that of the <a href="15024a.htm">Trappists</a>.</p>

<p>A Pachomian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> was a collection of buildings surrounded by a wall. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were distributed in houses, each house containing about forty <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. Three or four houses constituted a tribe. There would be thirty to forty houses in a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. There was an <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> over each <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and provosts with subordinate officials over each house. The <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were divided into houses according to the work they were employed in: thus there would be a house for carpenters, a house for agriculturists, and so forth. But other principles of division sem to have been employed, e.g., we hear of a house for the Greeks. On Saturdays and <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> all the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> assembled in the church for Mass; on other days the Office and other spiritual exercises were celebrated in the houses.</p>

<p>"The fundamental idea of St. Pachomius' rule", writes Abbot Butler, "was to establish a moderate level of observance (moderate in comparison with the life led by the <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a>) which might be <a href="11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on all; and then to leave it open to each - and to indeed encourage each - to go beyond the fixed minimum, according as he was prompted by his strength, his <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, and his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a>" ("Lausiac History", I, p. 236). This is strikingly illustrated in the rules concerning food. According to <a href="08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, in the preface to his translation of the "Rule of Pachomius", the tables were laid twice a day except on Wednesdays and Fridays, which, outside the seasons of <a href="11516a.htm">Easter</a> and Pentecost were fast days. Some only took very little at the second meal; some at one or other of the meals confined themselves to a single food; others took just a morsel of bread. Some abstained altogether from the community meal; for these bread, water, and salt were placed in their cell.</p>

<p>Pachomius appointed his successor a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> named Petronius, who died within a few months, having likewise named his successor, Horsiesi. In Horsiesi's time the order was threatened with a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a>. The <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> of one of the houses, instead of forwarding the produce of the work of his <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> to the head house of the order, where it would be sold and the price distributed to the different houses according to their need, wished to have the disposal of it for the sole benefit of his own <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Horsiesi, finding himself unable to cope with the situation, appointed Theodore, a favourite disciple of Pachomius, his coadjutor.</p>

<p>When Theodore died, in the year 368, Horsiesi was able to resume the government of the order. This threatened <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> brings prominently before us a feature connected with Pachomius' foundation which is never again met with in the East, and in the West only many centuries later. "Like C&icirc;teaux in a later age", writes Abbot Butler, "it almost at once assumed the shape of a fully organized congregation or order, with a superior general and a system of visitation and general chapters - in short, all the machinery of a centralized government, such as does not appear again in the monastic world until the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> and the Mendicant Orders arose in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries" (op. cit., I,235).</p>

<p>A word must be said about Schenoudi, or Schnoudi, or Senuti. Shortly after the middle of the fourth century, two <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>, Pgol and Pschais, changed their <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> into cenobitical ones. Of the latter we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> scarcely anything. Schenoudi, when a boy of about nine years old, came under the care of his uncle Pgol. Both Pgol and Schenoudi were reformers - the Pachomian Rule was not strict enough for them.</p>

<p>Schenoudi succeeded his uncle Pgol as head of the White Monastery of Athribis, and, till his death (about 453), was not only the greatest monastic leader, but one of the most important men, in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. He waged <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>; he took a prominent part in the rooting out of <a href="11388a.htm">paganism</a>; he championed the cause of the poor against the rich. He once went in person to Constantinople to complain of the tyranny of government officials. On one occasion 20,000 men, <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, and children took refuge in the White Monastery during an invasion of the savage Blemmyes of <a href="05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, and Schenoudi maintained all the fugitives for three months, providing them with food and medical aid. On another occasion he ransomed a hundred captives and sent them home with food, clothing, and money for their journey. Schenoudi's importance for the history of monasticism is small, for his influence, great as it was in his own country, did not make itself felt elsewhere. There were two barriers: Upper <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was a difficult and dangerous country for travellers, and such as did penetrate there would not be likely to visit a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> where hardly anything but Coptic was spoken. According to Abbot Butler, "Schenoudi is never named by any Greek or Latin writer" (op. cit., II,204). He has been rediscovered in our own time in <a href="01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.</p>

<p>In part II of Butler's "Lausiac History" is a map of Monastic <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. A glance at this map and the notes accompanying it brings forcibly before the mind an important fact in monastic history. With the exception of a single Pachomian <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="03297b.htm">Canopus</a>, near Alexandria, the cenobitic <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are in the South, and confined to a relatively small area. The <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, on the contrary, are everywhere, and especially in the North. These latter were thus far more accessible to <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> visiting <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and so became the patterns or models for the rest of the <a href="03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. It was the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a>, not the cenobitical, type of monasticism which went forth from <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</p>

<p>Monasticism at a very early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> spread along the route of the Exodus and the <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> of the Forty Years' Wandering. The solitaries had a special predilection for Scriptural sites. At every place hallowed by tradition, which <a href="14399a.htm">Syria</a> visited (A.D.385), she found <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a>. The attraction of <a href="14011a.htm">Mt. Sinai</a> for the solitaries was irresistible, in spite of the danger of captivity or death at the hands of the <a href="10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. In 373 a number of solitaries inhabited this mountain, living on dates and other fruit, such bread as they had being reserved for the Sacred Mysteries. All the week they lived apart in their cells; they gathered together in the church on Saturday evening and, after spending the night in <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a>, received communion on Sunday morning. Forty of them were massacred in 373, and on the same day another group of solitaries at Raithe (supposed to be Elim) were killed by a second band of barbarians. These events were described by eye-witnesses (<a href="14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, "H.E.", VII, 573-80). The same kind of life was being led at <a href="14011a.htm">Mt. Sinai</a>, and a similar experience was undergone some twenty years later when <a href="11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a> was there.</p>

<p>St. Hilarion, who for a time had been a disciple of St. Anthony, propagated monasticism of the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> type first in the neighbourhood of his native city Gaza and then in <a href="04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. His friend, <a href="13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, after practising the monastic life in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, founded a <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Eleutheropolis in Palestine somewhere about 330 or perhaps a little later.</p>

<p>In <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and its neighbourhood there were numerous <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at a very early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a>. To name only a few, there was the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Mount of Olives, from which <a href="11425a.htm">Palladius</a> went forth on his tour of the <a href="05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; there were two <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> in <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, built by the older and younger Melania respectively. At Bethlehem <a href="11582a.htm">St. Paula</a> founded three <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> and one for men about A.D.387. There was, besides, in Bethlehem the <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> where Cassian some years before began his <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>. The Lauras, which were very numerous, formed a conspicuous feature in Palestinian monasticism. The first seems to have been founded before 334 by St. Chariton at Pharan, a few miles from <a href="08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; later on two more were founded by the same saint at <a href="08339a.htm">Jericho</a> and at Suca.</p>

<p>St. Euthymius (473) founded another celebrated one in the valley of Cedron. Near <a href="08339a.htm">Jericho</a> was the laura ruled over by St. Gerasimus (475). Some details concerning the rules of this laura have fortunately been preserved in a very ancient Life of <a href="05630b.htm">St. Euthymius</a>. It consisted of a cenobium where the cenobitic life was practised by <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a> and others less proficient. There were also seventy cells for solitaries. Five days in the week these latter lived and worked alone in their cells. On Saturday they brought their work to the cenobium, where, after receiving <a href="07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, they partook of some cooked food and a little wine. The rest of the week their fare was bread, dates and water. When some of them asked to be allowed to heat some water, that they might cook some food and to have a lamp to read by, they were told that if they wished to live thus they had better take up their abode in the cenobium (Acta SS., March 1, 386,87).</p>

<p>Antioch, when <a href="08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> was a young man, was full of ascetics and the neighbouring mountains were peopled with <a href="07280a.htm">hermits</a>. So great was the impulse driving men to the solitary life that at one time there was an outcry, amounting almost to a <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, among <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> as well as <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> against those who embraced it. This was the occasion of <a href="08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom's</a> treatise against the opponents of monasticism: in the first book he dwelt upon the guilt incurred by them; the second and third were addressed respectively to a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> and a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> father who were opposing the wish of their sons to embrace the <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> state. The pathetic scene between the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> and his mother, which he describes in the beginning of the "De Sacertio", must be typical of what took place in many <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> homes. He himself so far yielded to his mother's entreaties that he contented himself with the ascetic life at home till her death. Palestine and Antioch must suffice as examples of the rapid spread of monasticism outside of <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. There is abundant evidence of the phenomenon in all the countries between the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia; and Mesopotamia, according to St Jerome, whose testimony is amply borne out by other writers, rivalled <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> itself in the number and <a href="07386a.htm">holiness</a> of its <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> (Comm. in Isaiam, V, xix).</p>

<p>We now come to a name second only in importance to St. Anthony's for the history of eastern monasticism. <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil the Great</a> before embracing the <a href="10459a.htm">monastic</a> state made a careful study of monasticism in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Palestine, Coelesyria, and Mesopotamia. The result was a decided preference for the cenobitic life. He founded several <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, over one of which he himself for a time presided, and very soon <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, modelled after his, spread over the East. His <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> assembled together for "psalmody" and "genuflexions" seven times a day, in accordance with the Psalmist's "Septies in die laudem dixi tibi" (Ps. cxviii, 164): at midnight ("Media nocte surgebam" &#151; Ibid., 62), at evening, morning and midday (Ps. lv, 18), at the third hour, the hour of Pentecost, and at the ninth, the sacred hour of the Passion. To complete the tale of seven, the midday <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> was divided into two parts separated by the community meal (Sermo "Asceticus", <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> edition, II,321). St. Basil's monastic ideal is set forth in a collection of his writings known as the "Asceticon", or "Ascetica", the most important of which are the "Regulae fusius tractatae", a series of answers to questions, fifty-five in number, and the "Regulae brevius tractatae", in which three hundred and thirteen questions are briefly replied to. It must not be supposed that the "Regulae" form a rule, though it would be possible to go a good way towards constituting one out of them. They are answers to questions which would naturally arise among <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> already in possession of a framework of customs or traditions. Sometimes they treat of practical questions, but as often as not they deal with matters concerning the spiritual life.</p>

<p>It would not be easy to exaggerate <a href="02330b.htm">St. Basil's</a> influence upon early monasticism: he furnished the type which ultimately prevailed. But two points of the utmost importance, as marking the difference between Eastern and Western <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, must be kept in mind. (1) He did not draw up a rule, but gave, what is far more an elastic thing, a model or pattern. (2) He was not the founder of a <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> order. No Eastern, except <a href="11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a>, ever was. An order, as we understand the term, is a purely Western product. "It is not enough", says a writer who certainly does not underrate St. Basil's influence, "to affirm that the <a href="02324a.htm">Basilian Order</a> is a myth. One must go farther and give up calling the Byzantine <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> <a href="02324a.htm">Basilians</a>. Those most concerned have never taken this title, and no Eastern writer that I <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> of has ever bestowed it upon them" (Pargoire in "Dict. d'Archeologie chretienne", s.v. "Basile"). In a word, every <a href="04340c.htm">monastery</a> is an order of its own. With St. Basil <a href="10467a.htm">Eastern monasticism</a> reached its final stage - communities of <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> leading the contemplative life and devoting themselves wholly to <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and work. The cenobitical life steadily became the normal form of the religious calling, and the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> one the exceptional form, requiring a long previous training.</p>

<p>We must now speak of the grounds upon which St. Basil based his decision - a decision so momentous for the future history of monasticism - in favour of the cenobitical life. Life with others is more expedient because, in the first place, even for the supply of their bodily needs, men depend upon one another. Further, there is the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of charity. The solitary has only himself to regard; yet, "charity seeks not itself".</p>

<p>Again, the solitary will not equally discover his faults, there being no one to correct him with meekness and mercy. There are <a href="12372b.htm">precepts</a> of charity which can only be fulfilled in the cenobitical life. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are not all given to all men, but one is given to one man and another to another. We cannot be partakers in the gifts not bestowed on ourselves if we live by ourselves. The great danger to the solitary is self-complacency; he is not put to the test, so that he is unable to learn his faults or his progress. How can he learn <a href="07543b.htm">humility</a> when there is no one to prefer before himself? Or patience when there is no one to yield to? Whose feet shall he wash? To whom shall he be as a servant? (Reg. fus. tract., Q. vii.) This condemnation of the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life is interesting because of what might almost be called its tameness. One would expect at least a lurid picture of the dangers which the solitary ran, delusions, melancholy culminating in despair, terrible moral and spiritual falls, the abandonment of the religious calling for the life of vice, and so forth. But instead of such things we have little more than what amounts to disadvantages and the risk of somewhat flat and commonplace kinds of failure, against which the common life afforded the best protection. Clearly St. Basil found little that was tragic during the two years he was investigating monasticism in <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that so uncompromising a verdict against the <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life would stir up a fierce conflict. As a matter of fact, it did nothing of the kind. Palestine, at the end of the fourth century, began to supersede <a href="05329b.htm">Egypt</a> as the centre of monasticism, and in Palestine the laura and the cenobium were in perfect harmony. That of St. Gerasimus, with its cenobium already referred to, may be taken as a typical example. St. Basil's authority was equal to St. Anthony's among the leaders of Palestinian monasticism; yet they took it as a matter of course that life in the laura was the most perfect, though under ordinary circumstances it should not be entered upon before an apprenticeship had been served in a cenobium. The paradox is not so great as it may at first sight appear. The dweller in the laura was under an <a href="01695c.htm">archimandrite</a> or <a href="01015c.htm">abbot</a> and so was not exposed to the dangers of the purely <a href="07280a.htm">eremitical</a> state.</p>

<p>At the <a href="03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, monasticism had so become part of the life of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> that it was specially legislated for. Monasteries were not to be erected without the leave of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>; <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were to receive due <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a>, but were not to mix themselves up with the affairs of Church or State. The were to be subject to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a>, etc. (can.iv). Clerics and <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> were not to serve in <a href="15546c.htm">war</a> or embrace a secular life (can.vii). Monasteries were not to be secularized (can.xxiv).</p>

<p>Solitary spots, according to St. Basil, should be chosen as sites for <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Nevertheless, they soon found their way into cities. According to one scholar, at least fifteen <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded at Constantinople in the time of <a href="04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>; but others affirm that the three most ancient ones only dated back to the time of <a href="14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> (375-95). In 518 there were at least fifty-four <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Constantinople. Their names and those of their rulers are given in a petition addressed by the <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> of Constantinople to Pope Hormisdas in 518.</p>
