<p>Founder of the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which was afterwards merged in the <a href="07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a>. The son of a Jewish rabbi, he was born at Saverne in Alsace, 12 April, 1802; he died at <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 2 February, 1852. He received the name of Jacob at his <a href="03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and was the third youngest of seven children whom his mother Lia Suzanna Haller, bore to his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>, Lazarus Libermann. He was brought up according to the sternly strict tenets of the Talmud, and his mind was early imbued with a special horror of the "Goim", or <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. He lost his mother when he was nine years old; and this, together with the harsh treatment he received from his schoolmaster, caused his boyhood to pass in much bitterness. The learned and universally esteemed rabbi of Saverne fixed his mind on his son, Jacob, as his successor in the rabbinical office. With this in view, he sent him to Metz to perfect his studies in the Talmud, and in Hebrew and Chaldaic. But <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> had other designs on the young man, who was then in his twentieth year. During his stay at <a href="10247a.htm">Metz</a>, the Gospels, translated into Hebrew came accidentally into his hands, and impressed him deeply. Moreover, his eldest brother first, and afterwards two other brothers, embraced <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. And, although Jacob deeply resented their change of religion, he gradually came to recognize their <a href="07131b.htm">happiness</a> and peace of <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, which was in strong contrast with his own distracted frame of mind. Finally, he obtained from his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a> permission to go to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>; and there he came under the influence of <a href="05152a.htm">M. Drach</a>, a convert from <a href="08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, who had him received into the College Stanislas, where he was instructed in the <a href="15073a.htm">truths</a> of Faith, which he embraced with eagerness. He was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> on <a href="03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a>, 1826, in the twenty-third year of his age. At <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> he took the three-fold name of Francis Mary Paul, the first two in gratitude to his godfather, Baron Fran&ccedil;ois de Mallet, and to his godmother, Comtesse Marie d'Heuse, and the last as a mark of his admiration of the great <a href="11567b.htm">Apostle of the Gentiles</a>, whom he was so closely to imitate in many respects.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Immediately after his <a href="04347a.htm">conversion</a>, M. Libermann displayed marked signs of a vocation for the <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. His protectors and friends found a place for him, first, in the <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> of the Missions de France, where he received <a href="14779a.htm">tonsure</a> five months after his <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and later in the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Sulpice, which he entered in October, 1827. On the very eve of his promotion to <a href="14320a.htm">subdeaconship</a>, he was stricken down by an attack of epilepsy which was to be his companion for the next five years. During that time he was kept by his charitable superiors at the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Issy. It was there that he was brought into close apostolic relationship with two Creole seminarians, M. Le Vavasseur, from Bourbon, and M. Tisserand, from <a href="13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, both of whom were filled with <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the evangelization of the poor ex-slaves of those islands. This acquaintanceship evoked the first concept of a religious <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> for the conversion of those abandoned <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>. It took five years more of <a href="12345b.htm">prayer</a> and patience to accomplish the foundation of the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, for that purpose. Meanwhile, M. Libermann was called away to become, though yet only in <a href="10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, master of <a href="11144a.htm">novices</a> for the <a href="05596b.htm">Eudist</a> Fathers at <a href="12771b.htm">Rennes</a>. After two years of devotion to that work (1838-39), he felt a very positive call from <a href="06608a.htm">God</a> to unite with MM. Le Vavasseur and Tisserand in furthering the apostolate to the <a href="12627a.htm">negroes</a>. At their suggestion, he proceeded to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and laid his plans before the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The year of his sojourn at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1840-41) was passed in great obscurity and poverty. He profited by the time he was kept waiting for a decision to write the provisional rules of the proposed institute, as well as a remarkable "Commentary on St. John's Gospel". At last, after a year's waiting, the obscure and friendless ecclesiastic received the warm encouragement of the Cardinal Prefect of <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, to pursue his project for the evangelization of the <a href="12627a.htm">negroes</a>. He repaired to the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> to prepare for his <a href="11279a.htm">ordination</a>, which took place at <a href="01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, 18 September, 1841. On the twenty-seventh of the same month the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary was opened in the neighbouring village of La Neuville.</p>

<p>The first occupants of the <a href="11144a.htm">novitiate</a> were the founder himself, his first associate, Father La Vavasseur, and a sub-deacon, M. Collin. Others filled with <a href="15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> quickly joined them, among the number being Rev. Ignatius Schwindemhammer, who was destined to be the founder's immediate successor. Missions were soon offered to the infant <a href="14074a.htm">society</a> in Mauritius, where Father Laval wrought wonders which continue to the present day; in Bourbon and <a href="07114a.htm">Hayti</a>; and, especially in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>. Father Libermann's sons were, practically, the first since the downfall of the African Church to penetrate the Dark Continent. Most of the first missioners paid for their heroism with their lives; but others filled their places; and the widespread prosperity of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, at the present day is, in large measure, due to the initiative and self-sacrifice of the first members of the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The Venerable Libermann was the heart and <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a>, the father and model of the nascent community during the seven years of its independent existence, 1841-1848. By that time it had become numerous and flourishing; and <a href="12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> that it should be engrafted on the <a href="07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a>, which had a similar object, but which had become almost extinct during the Revolution (see <a href="07416a.htm">RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS OF THE HOLY GHOST</a>, I). This difficult and delicate task of uniting two congregations was successfully accomplished, at the request of the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, by Father Libermann; and he was chosen superior general of the united <a href="14074a.htm">societies</a>, a post he occupied till his death. By the time of his death, the Venerable Libermann enjoyed the reputation of the highest <a href="07386a.htm">sanctity</a> in the minds of all who <a href="08673a.htm">knew</a> him; and shortly after his death there was a widespread desire to have the cause of his <a href="02364b.htm">beatification</a> introduced. The usual <a href="04447a.htm">ecclesiastical tribunal</a> was erected in <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1867; its labours were continued till 1872, when the depositions of the witnesses and the other documents bearing on the case were forwarded to <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After mature examination and deliberation, the Sacred Congregation of Rites unanimously decreed the introduction of his cause. This <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> was ratified a few days afterwards, 1 June, 1876, by <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who thus declared the holy convert from <a href="08537a.htm">Judaism</a> Venerable. Since that time, the cause of his <a href="02364b.htm">beatification</a> has progressed through the usual forms; and his spiritual sons throughout the world expect to see him ere long declared Blessed.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Several thousand of his letters have been preserved; and these, together with all his other writings, have been examined and approved by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. His method of <a href="05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> was, like his life, a mingling of sweetness and self-denial, breathing peace and <a href="06147a.htm">courage</a>, in the midst of all manner of trials. His published writings are, "Lettres Spirituelles", 2 vols. (Paris, 1880); "Ecrits Spirituels" (Paris, 1891); "Commentaire sur l'Evangile de St. Jean" (Paris, n.d.).</p>
