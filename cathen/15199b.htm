<p>The project of a Catholic University for <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was launched at the Synod of Thurles in 1850. To revive <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> learning was essential for the well-being of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; the suggestion of <a href="12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and the example of <a href="09391a.htm">Louvain</a> were inspiring; and, above all, it was <a href="10733a.htm">necessary</a> to provide a seat of higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> on <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lines for lay students who kept away from the condemned Queen's Colleges, where religion had no official or collegiate recognition and the governing and academic bodies, as regards <a href="04370b.htm">Cork</a> and <a href="06373a.htm">Galway</a>, were foreign to the religious convictions of the people they were intended to <a href="05295b.htm">educate</a>. The <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> gave approval in 1852; liberal contributions poured in, and <a href="12462a.htm">property</a> was acquired in Dublin for <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> purposes. The <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> had secured <a href="10794a.htm">John Henry Newman</a> as <a href="12676c.htm">rector</a> for a short term of years. At their meeting in May, 1854, the <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> gave solemn effect to the <a href="09202a.htm">papal letters</a> regarding the erection of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. On the Feast of Pentecost following <a href="10794a.htm">Dr. Newman</a> took the <a href="11176a.htm">oath</a> of office at a function in the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church, where <a href="04564a.htm">Archbishop Cullen</a> delivered an address. Statutes, framed for the government of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, were sanctioned by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> authority was granted to confer degrees; and in November of the same year the work of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> began. The <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, acting through a committee, constituted the supreme governing body. Among its authorities the senate was the body representative of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>; and the rectorial council was the <a href="12676c.htm">rector's</a> ordinary adviser. The <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> had five faculties, viz.-theology, <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>, medicine, philosophy and letters, <a href="13598b.htm">science</a>. <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a> was careful to secure the services of various distinguished men as professors and lecturers. The first appointments to professorial chairs comprised the names of <a href="11294a.htm">Edmund O'Reilly, S.J.</a>, Dr. P. Leahy, Eugene O'Curry, <a href="01323b.htm">T.W. Allies</a>, and D.F. McCarthy; and gradually a considerable number of students, including some in high rank, from different <a href="05607b.htm">European</a> countries, began to frequent the halls of the new <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. But the institution itself and its students laboured under the greatest disadvantages. The <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> had no charter from the State to confer degrees, nor were its lectures recognized elsewhere in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> as leading to a degree. It had to depend entirely on <a href="15506a.htm">voluntary</a> contributions for its revenue. In the immediate issue these obstacles were not to be adequately surmounted even by the fame and genius of <a href="10794a.htm">Newman</a>, the eminence of the professors, the devoted loyalty of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> students, and the constant efforts of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But the determination of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> produced highly important results. The Government, confronted with their standing protest, after a time deemed it expedient to attempt to deal with their grievance in the matter of <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. The Liberal plan of a Supplemental Charter, incorporating the Catholic University as a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a>, not as a <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, and enabling the students <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> in its halls to obtain degrees from an enlarged Queen's University, failed in 1866; the Conservative scheme of chartering an unendowed <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was announced, considered, and abruptly withdrawn in 1868; Mr. Gladstone's proposal of one <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>, comprising <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and other colleges without public endowment as well as Trinity College and two of the Queen's Colleges with their endowments continued, was defeated in 1873 by an adverse majority of three votes in the House of Commons. But in 1879, on the second reading of a University Bill introduced by the O'Connor Don, the Beaconsfield administration announced that they would themselves introduce a University Bill for <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; and the promised Bill became an Act of Parliament in that year. It abolished the Queen's University, while sparing its colleges, and set up in its place the Royal University of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, an examining body entitled to give degrees to all comes on condition of passing the prescribed examinations, and to award prizes for distinguished answering. Moreover, an arrangement was made to provide a small indirect endowment to help the work of the Catholic University through fellowships to be held by a certain number of its professors.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>It was for the purpose of arranging the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges of higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> in an associated group, to stand against the endowed Queen's Colleges in the competition of the Royal University, that the framework of the Catholic University was considerably modified in 1882. In that year the teaching institution in St. Stephen's Green became University College and the Catholic University, of which Maynooth since 1876 had been constituted a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a>, was made to embrace an association of colleges, each retaining its own independent collegiate organization. The success of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges cleared the way for Mr. Birrell's University Act in 1909. University College, under the management of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from 1883, gave a fine lead in conjunction with the Catholic University School of Medicine. This <a href="13554b.htm">school</a>, which in 1892 was placed under a governing body of its own, had been founded by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> in 1855 in Cecilia St., <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and, unendowed though it was, had been a success from the start, owing to the advantage it enjoyed, in that its teaching was recognized as qualifying a student to stand the examinations for a license to practise. It now merges, like University College, in the new University College, <a href="05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, which is the leading constituent college of the National University established in 1909. This constituent college has utilized the buildings of the Catholic University. The Catholic University church, built by <a href="10794a.htm">Dr. Newman</a>, has been made available by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the catholic members of the National University; but the Catholic University itself still exists, as was affirmed in an important judicial decision by the Master of the Rolls in 1911.</p>

<p><a href="10794a.htm">Dr. Newman</a>, who retired in 1858, was succeeded in the rectorial Chair by Dr. Woodlock, Dr. Neville, <a href="10442c.htm">Dr. Molloy</a>, and Dr. O'Donnell. It is said that &#163;250,000, subscribed mainly in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and America, was collected and expended upon the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. After providing buildings and equipment, that sum would allow little over &#163;8000 a year during the quarter of a century that elapsed before the fellowships of the Royal University were made available. The ideals sustained and the reformed achieved in higher <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> amply justify the effort. Archbishop Walsh and John Dillon were its students; the "Atlantis" and O'Curry's Lectures were its products. Even in its last years it had among its professors such men as Aubrey De Vere, Dr. Casey, George Sigerson, <a href="10442c.htm">Dr. Molloy</a>, James Stewart, and Robert Ornsby.</p>
