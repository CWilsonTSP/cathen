<p>The name applied to a doctrine which has grown out of the common Catholic teaching about lying and which is its complement.</p>

<h2>The Catholic doctrine on lying</h2>

<p>According to the common <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> it is never allowable to tell a lie, not even to save <a href="09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="09238c.htm">life</a>. A lie is something intrinsically <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a>, and as <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> may not be done that good may come of it, we are never allowed to tell a lie. However, we are also under an <a href="11189a.htm">obligation</a> to keep secrets faithfully, and sometimes the easiest way of fulfilling that <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> is to say what is <a href="05781a.htm">false</a>, or to tell a lie. Writers of all creeds and of none, both ancient and modern, have frankly accepted this position. They admit the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the lie of necessity, and maintain that when there is a conflict between <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="15073a.htm">veracity</a> it is <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> that should prevail. The common <a href="05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> has formulated the theory of <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> reservation as a means by which the claims of both <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="15073a.htm">veracity</a> can be satisfied.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<h2>The doctrine of wide mental reservation</h2>

<p>The <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was broached tentatively and with great diffidence by St. <a href="12671c.htm">Raymund of Pennafort</a>, the first writer on casuistry. In his "Summa" (1235) St. Raymund quotes the saying of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> that a man must not slay his own <a href="14153a.htm">soul</a> by lying in order to preserve the life of another, and that it would be a most perilous <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to admit that we may do a less <a href="05649a.htm">evil</a> to prevent another doing a greater. And most <a href="05072b.htm">doctors</a> teach this, he says, though he allows that others teach that a lie should be told when a man's life is at stake. Then he adds:</p>

<blockquote><p>I believe, as at present advised, that when one is asked by murderers bent on taking the life of someone hiding in the house whether he is in, no answer should be given; and if this betrays him, his death will be imputable to the murderers, not to the other's silence. Or he may use an equivocal expression, and say 'He is not at home,' or something like that. And this can be defended by a great number of instances found in the <a href="14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Or he may say simply that he is not there, and if his <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> tells him that he ought to say that, then he will not speak against his <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a>, nor will he <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nor is <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> really opposed to any of these methods. </p></blockquote>

<p>Such expressions as "He is not at home" were called <em>equivocations</em>, or <em>amphibologies</em>, and when there was good reason for using them their lawfulness was admitted by all. If the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> inquired for was really at home, but did not wish to see the visitor, the meaning of the phrase "He is not at home" was restricted by the mind of the speaker to this sense, "He is not at home for you, or to see you." Hence equivocations and amphibologies came to be called <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> restrictions or reservations. It was commonly admitted that an equivocal expression need not necessarily be used when the words of the speaker receive a special meaning from the circumstances in which he is placed, or from the position which he holds. Thus, if a confessor is asked about <a href="14004b.htm">sins</a> made known to him in confession, he should answer "I do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a>," and such words as those when used by a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> mean "I do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> apart from confession," or "I do not <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> as man," or "I have no <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the matter which I can communicate."</p>

<p>All <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers were, and are, agreed that when there is good reason, such expressions as the above may be made use of, and that they are not lies. Those who hear them may understand them in a sense which is not <a href="15073a.htm">true</a>, but their self-deception may be permitted by the speaker for a good reason. If there is no good reason to the contrary, <a href="15073a.htm">veracity</a> requires all to speak frankly and openly in such a way as to be understood by those who are addressed. A <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed if mental reservations are used without just cause, or in cases when the questioner has a <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to the naked <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>The doctrine of strict mental reservation</h2>

<p>In the sixteenth century a further development of this commonly received <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> began to be admitted even by some <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of note. We shall probably not be far wrong if we attribute the change to the very difficult political circumstances of the time due to the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion. <a href="01793b.htm">Martin Aspilcueta</a>, the "Doctor Navarrus," as he was called, was one of the first to develop the new <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. He was nearing the end of a long life, and was regarded as the foremost living authority on canon law and <a href="14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, when he was consulted on a case of <a href="04268a.htm">conscience</a> by the fathers of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at Valladolid. The case sent to him for solution was drawn up in these terms:</p>

<blockquote><p>Titius, who privately said to a <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a> 'I take thee for my wife' without the intention of marrying her, answered the judge who asked him whether he had said those words that he did not say them, understanding mentally that he did not say them with the intention of marrying the <a href="15687b.htm">woman</a>. </p></blockquote>

<p>Navarrus was asked whether Titius told a lie, whether he had committed <a href="11696a.htm">perjury</a>, or whether he committed any <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> at all. He drew up an elaborate opinion on the case and dedicated it to the reigning pontiff, <a href="07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. Navarrus maintained that Titius neither lied, nor committed <a href="11696a.htm">perjury</a>, nor any <a href="14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever, on the supposition that he had a good reason for answering as he did.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>This theory became known as the <em>doctrine of strict <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> reservation</em>, to distinguish it from wide <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> reservation with which we have thus far been occupied. In the strict <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> reservation the speaker mentally adds some qualification to the words which he utters, and the words together with the <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> qualification make a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> assertion in accordance with fact. On the other hand, in a wide <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> reservation, the qualification comes from the ambiguity of the words themselves, or from the circumstances of time, place, or <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> in which they are uttered.</p>

<p>The opinion of Navarrus was received as probable by such contemporary <a href="14580a.htm">theologians</a> of different <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> as Salon, Sayers, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, and <a href="09192a.htm">Lessius</a>. The <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> Sanchez formulated it in clear and distinct terms, and added the weight of his authority on the side of the defenders. Laymann, however, another <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> of equal or greater weight, rejected the <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as did Azor, S.J., the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="14152a.htm">Soto</a>, and others. Laymann shows at considerable length that such reservations are lies. For that man tells a lie who makes use of words which are <a href="05781a.htm">false</a> with the intention of deceiving another. And this is what is done when a strict <a href="10321a.htm">mental</a> reservation is made use of. The words uttered do not express the <a href="15073a.htm">truth</a> as known to the speaker. They are at variance with it and therefore they constitute a lie. The opinion of Navarrus was freely debated in the <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for some years, and was acted upon by some of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> confessors of the Faith in <a href="05445a.htm">England</a> in the difficult circumstances in which they were frequently placed. It was, however, condemned as formulated by Sanchez by <a href="08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> on March 2, 1679 (propositions 26, 27). After this condemnation by the <a href="07424b.htm">Holy See</a> no <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="14580a.htm">theologian</a> has defended the lawfulness of strict mental reservations.</p>
