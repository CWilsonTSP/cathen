<h2>Diocese of Grenoble (Gratianopolitana)</h2>

<p>Now comprises the Department of Is&egrave;re and the Canton of Villeurbanne (Rh&ocirc;ne). The ancient <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was a suffragan of Vienne and included the Deanery of see at <a href="13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, which in 1779, was made a <a href="05001a.htm">bishopric</a> with the <a href="05001a.htm">see</a> at <a href="03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>. By the Concordat, the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Grenoble was made a suffragan of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, thirteen <a href="01697b.htm">archipresbyterates</a> of the former Diocese of Vienne were affiliated to the Diocese of Grenoble, and there were annexes to it some <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Dioceses of <a href="02415a.htm">Belley</a>, <a href="06378a.htm">Gap</a>, <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and Die.</p>

<p>Domninus, the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Grenoble known to history, attended the Council of <a href="01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> in 381. Among his successors are mentioned: St. Ceratus (441-52), celebrated in legend for his controversies against <a href="01707c.htm">Arianism</a>; St. Ferjus (Ferreolus) (at the end of the seventh century), who, according to tradition, was killed by a <a href="11388a.htm">pagan</a> while preaching; <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> (1080-1132), noted for his <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> in carrying out <a href="06791c.htm">Gregory VII's</a> orders concerning reform and for his opposition to Guy of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vienne, and subsequently <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the title of <a href="03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>; Pierre Scarron (1621-1667), who, with the co-operation of many <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, restored <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Dauphin&eacute;; Cardinal Le Camus (1671-1707), organizer of charitable loan associations; Jean de Caulet (1726-1771), who brought about general acceptance of the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, whose collection of books was the nucleus of the public <a href="09227b.htm">library</a> of the city, and during whose episcopate <a href="02780a.htm">Bridaine</a>, the preacher, after delivering a sermon on <a href="01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> went through the streets of the city with wagons and was unable to gather all the donations of linen, furniture and clothing that were offered. The <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and Augustinians founded at an early <a href="04636c.htm">date</a> numerous <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a> in the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a>, that of Vizille <a href="04636c.htm">dating</a> from 994, but during <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh's</a> episcopal administration, monastic life attained a fuller development. The chapter-abbey of Saint-Martin de Mis&eacute;r&eacute;, whence originated many Augustinian <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a>, and the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="12428b.htm">priory</a> of Villard Beno&icirc;t at Pontcharra were important during twelfth and thirteenth centuries. But the peculiar monastic foundation of Dauphin&eacute;, contemporaneous with <a href="07515b.htm">St. Hugh's</a> regime, was that of the <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> under <a href="03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> in 1084. The Fr&egrave;res du Saint-Esprit, who during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> were scattered broadcast through the Diocese of Grenoble, did much to inculcate among the people habits of mutual assistance. The two sojourns at Grenoble in 1598 and 1600 respectively by <a href="04422b.htm">Cotton</a>, the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, later confessor to <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a>, were prolific of some notable conversions from <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>; in memory of this the Constable de Lesdigui&egrave;res, himself a convert in 1622, favoured the founding at Grenoble of a celebrated <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> house. In 1651 a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> was established in connexion with the residence, and here Vaucanson, the well-known mechanician, studied. In 1700 the institution included <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> courses in its curriculum. From the first half of the thirteenth century the French branch of the <a href="15527b.htm">Waldenses</a> had its chief seat in Dauphin&eacute;, from which country emanated Guillaume Farel, the most captivating preacher of the French <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Pierre de S&eacute;biville, an <a href="01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="06280b.htm">friar</a>, introduced <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> into Grenoble in 1522. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> was sorely tried by the <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion, especially in 1562, when the cruel Baron des Andrets acted as the Prince de Cond&eacute;s lieutenant-general in Dauphin&eacute;. <a href="12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, when taken a <a href="12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, spent two days at Grenoble in 1799. <a href="12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, in turn was kept in close confinement in the prefecture of Grenoble from 21 July until 2 August, 1808, Bishop Simon not being permitted even to visit him.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The following <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> may be mentioned as natives of what constitutes the present Diocese of Grenoble: St. Amatus, the <a href="01462b.htm">anchorite</a> (sixth century), founder of the Abbey of Remiremont, and St. Peter, <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarantaise (1102-1174), a <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>, born in the Ancient Archdiocese of Vienne. Moreover, it was in the <a href="03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the superior <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> of Grenoble that <a href="08326c.htm">J.-B. Vianney</a>, the future <a href="08326c.htm">Cur&eacute; of Ars</a>, was <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a>, 13 August, 1815. The Bishopric of Grenoble is in possession of an almost complete account of the pastoral visits made between 1339 and 1970, a <a href="11403a.htm">pal&aelig;ographical</a> record perhaps unique of its kind in <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>.</p>

<h3>Archbishopric of Vienne</h3>

<p>The legend according to which Crescens, the first <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vienne, is identical with the <a href="04484b.htm">Crescens</a> of <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs20">2 Timothy 4:20</a> certainly postdates the letter of <a href="15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Arles (417) and the letter of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul in 451; because, although both these documents allude to the claims to glory which Arles owes to St. Trophimus, neither of them mentions Crescens. Archbishop Ado, of Vienne, (860-75) set afoot this legend of the Apostolic origin of the See of Vienne and put down St. Zachary, St. Martin, and St. Verus, later successors of Crescens, as belonging to the Apostolic period. This legend was confirmed by the "Recueil des privil&egrave;ges de l'&Eacute;glise de Viene", which, however, was not compiled under the supervision of the future Pope <a href="03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, as M. Gundlach has maintained, but a little earlier date, about 1060, as Mgr. Duchesne has <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a>. This collection contains the pretended letters of a series of <a href="12260a.htm">popes</a>, from <a href="12126b.htm">Pius I</a> to Paschal II, and sustains the claims of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Vienne. "Le Livre &eacute;piscopal de l'archev&ecirc;que L&eacute;ger" (1030-1070) included both the inventions of Ado and the forged letters of the "Recueil".</p>

<p>It is historically certain that Verus, present at the <a href="01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> in 314, was the fourth <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vienne. In the beginning the twelve cities of the two <a href="15417a.htm">Viennese</a> provinces were under the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, but when Arles was made an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, at the end of the fourth century, the See of Vienne grew less important. The disputes that later arose between it and the See of Arles concerning their respective antiquity are well-known in <a href="07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. In 450 <a href="09154b.htm">Leo I</a> gave the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, or Vienne the <a href="13055c.htm">right</a> to ordain the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tarantaise, Valance, <a href="09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and Grenoble. Many vicissitudes followed, and the territorial limit of the powers of <a href="10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Vienne followed the wavering frontier of the Kingdom of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and in 779, was considerably restricted by the organization of a new <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> comprising Tarantaise, <a href="01591c.htm">Aosta</a>, and Sion. In 1120 <a href="03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, who was <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vienne under the name of Guy of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, decided that the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne should have for suffragans the Bishops of Grenoble, <a href="15250a.htm">Valence</a>, Die, <a href="15493a.htm">Viviers</a>, <a href="09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and Maurienne; that the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Tarantaise should obey him, notwithstanding the fact that this <a href="01691a.htm">archbishop</a> himself had suffragans, that he should exercise the primacy over the provinces of <a href="02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, Narbonne, <a href="02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="01237e.htm">Aix</a>, <a href="02067c.htm">Auch</a>, and Embrun, and that, as the <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of both provinces already bore the title of <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a>, the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne should be known as the "Primate of Primates". In 1023 the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Vienne became lords paramount. They had the title of Count, and when in 1033 the Kingdom or Arles was reunited to the empire, they retained their independence and obtained from the empire the title of Archchancellors of the Kingdom or Arles (1157). Besides the four Bishops of Vienne heretofore mentioned, others are <a href="07462a.htm">honoured</a> as <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a>. In enumerating them we shall follow M. Duchesne's <a href="03738a.htm">chronology</a>: <a href="08586a.htm">St. Justus</a>, St. Dionysius, St. Paracodes, St. Florentius (about 374), St. Lupicinus, St. Simplicius (about 400), <a href="11517a.htm">St. Paschasius</a>, St. Nectarius, St. Nicetas (about 449), <a href="09580a.htm">St. Mamertus</a> (d. 475 or 476), who instituted the rogation days, whose brother Claudianus Mamertus was known as a <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and poet, and during whose episcopate St. Leonianus held for forty years the post of grand penitentiary at Vienne; <a href="02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a> (494-5 Feb., 518), St. Julianus (about 520-533), St. Pantagathus (about 538), St. Namatius (d. 559), St. Evantius (d. 584-6), St. Verus (586), St. Desiderius (Didier) 596-611, St. Domnolus (about 614), St. &AElig;therius, St. Hecdicus, St. Chaoaldus (about 654-64), St. Bobolinus, St. Georgius, St. Deodatus, St. Blidrannus (about 680), St. Eoldus, St. Eobolinus, St. Barnardus (810-41), noted for his conspiracies in favour of the sons of Louis the Pious, St. Ado (860-875), author of a universal history and two <a href="09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>, St. Thibaud (end of the tenth century). Among its later <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Guy of <a href="03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> (1084-1119), who became <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a> under the title of <a href="03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, Christophe de Beaumont, who occupied the See of Vienne for seven months of the year 1745 and afterwards became <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Jean Georges Le Franc de Pompignan (1774-90), brother of the poet and a great enemy of the "philosophers", and also d'Aviau (1790-1801), illustrious because of his strong opposition to the civil constitution of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the first of the <em>emigr&eacute;</em> <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> to re-enter <a href="06166a.htm">France</a> (May, 1797), returning under an assumed name and at the peril of his life.</p>

<p>Michael Servetus was living in Vienne, whither he had been attracted by Archbishop Palmier, when <a href="03195b.htm">Calvin</a> denounced him to the <a href="08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> for his books. During the proceedings ordered by <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of Vienne, Servetus fled to <a href="14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> (1553) In 1605 the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> founded a <a href="04107b.htm">college</a> at Vienne, and here Massilon taught at the close of the seventeenth century. The churches of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Andr&eacute; le Haut are ancient <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> foundations. (For the celebrated council held at Vienne in 1311 see <a href="14493a.htm">TEMPLARS</a> and COUNCIL OF VIENNE.)</p>

<p>After the <a href="04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> the title of Vienne passed to the <a href="09472a.htm">See of Lyons</a>, whose titular was henceforth called "Archbishop of <a href="09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and Vienne," although Vienne belongs to the Diocese of Grenoble.</p>

<p>The principal places of <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in the present Diocese of Grenoble are: Notre-Dame de Parm&eacute;nie, near Rivers, re-established in the seventeenth century at the instance of a shepherdess; Notre-Dame de l'Osier, at Vinay, which dates from 1649 and Notre-Dame de la Salette, which owes its origin to the apparition of the Virgin, 19 September, 1846, to Maximin Giraud and M&eacute;lanie Mathieu, the devotion to Notre-Dame de la Salette being authorized by Bishop Bruillard, 1 May, 1852.</p>

<p>Before the enforcement of the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 there were in the Diocese of Grenoble <a href="02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>, Oliv&eacute;tans, <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="03288a.htm">Regular Canons</a> of the Immaculate Conception, <a href="11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, Fathers of Holy Ghost and the Holy Heart of Mary, <a href="04539b.htm">Brothers of the Cross of Jesus</a>, Brothers of the Holy Family, <a href="08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a> and <a href="13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>. The <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> congregations of <a href="15687b.htm">women</a> were: the Sisters of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, devoted to <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> work and teaching, and founded by Cathiard, who, after having been an officer under <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, died Archpriest of Pont de Beauvoisin; the Sisters of Providence, founded in 1841, devoted to <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> and teaching (mother-house at St. Marcellin), and the Sisters of Our Lady of the Cross, likewise devoted to <a href="07480a.htm">hospital</a> and <a href="05295b.htm">educational</a> work, founded in 1832 (mother-house at Murinais). Prior to the congregations law of 1901, the following institutions in the Diocese of Grenoble were in charge of <a href="12748b.htm">religious</a> orders: 65 infant <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 asylum for incurable children, 2 asylums for deaf-mutes, 4 boys' <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 8 girls' <a href="11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 7 free industrial <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> (ouvroirs), 2 houses of shelter, 33 <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, hospices, or private <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 1 dispensary, and 18 houses for religious nurses caring for the sick in their homes. In 1905, when the Concordat ceased, the Diocese of Grenoble had a population of 601,940 <a href="14153a.htm">souls</a>, with 51 <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 530 <em>succursales</em>, and 87 curacies subventioned by the State.</p>

<h2 id="section2">University of Grenoble</h2>

<p>Created by three <a href="03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, 12 May, 27 May, and 30 September, 1339. On 25 July, 1339, the Dauphin Humbert II (the counts of Dauphin&eacute; bore the title of Dauphin) drew up a charter of the privileges granted to the students at Grenoble, <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a> measures to attract them, and stipulated that the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> should give instruction in civil and canon law, medicine, and the arts. A curious ordinance issued 10 May, 1340 by Humbert II commanded the destruction of all the forges in the vicinity of Grenoble lest they should produce an irreparable famine of wood and charcoal. Humbert may have wished that life should be frugal where <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> was established. Finally on 1 August, 1340, he declared that the superior court of <a href="08571c.htm">justice</a> of Dauphin&eacute; (<em>conseil delphinal</em>), which he removed from Saint-Marcellin to Grenoble, should be composed of seven counsellors, four whom might be chosen from among the professors at Grenoble. Humbert's projects do not appear to have been completely realized. The <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> lacked resources, indeed arts and medicine were not taught, and even the chairs of law seem scarcely to have survived the reign of Humbert II. At all events, when Louis XI created the <a href="15251a.htm">University of Valence</a> in 1452, he declared that no institution of the kind existed at that time in Dauphin&eacute;. But in 1542 Fran&ccedil;ois de Bourbon, Count of Saint-Pol, great-uncle of <a href="07225a.htm">Henry IV</a> of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>, and governor of Dauphin&eacute;, re-established the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. The Italian jurist Gribaldi, the <a href="12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> jurist Govea, and the French jurist Pierre Lorioz, called Loriol, attracted many students thither, but the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of these professors was suspected. This was one of the reasons which, in April, 1565, led Charles IX to unite the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of Grenoble to that of <a href="15250a.htm">Valence</a>, for which in 1567 Bishop Montluc, well known as a diplomat and powerful at court, was able to obtain the noted jurist Cujas. The citizens of Grenoble protested and sent delegates to <a href="11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but the edict of union between the <a href="15188a.htm">universities</a> was strengthened by the circumstance that at the very time when Charles IX published his edict Govea and Loriol were compelled to institute a suite against the town of Grenoble in order to secure the payment of their arrears of salary. Equally ineffectual were the efforts for the renewal of the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> frequently made by the town in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, on 1 November, 1805, re-established the faculty of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of Grenoble. Since 1896 the different faculties of Grenoble form the <a href="15188a.htm">University</a> of Grenoble.</p>
