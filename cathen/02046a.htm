<p>The Greeks have long regarded their religion as a national affair. This notion is so deep-rooted that they cannot understand how a citizen can well be a <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> Greek if he gives his allegiance to any religion which is not that of the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. At the present time the majority of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who live within the Diocese of Athens are therefore foreigners, or of foreign descent. Of the foreigners who are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the greater part are of Italian nationality. Most of those who are of foreign descent have come into Athens and other portions of this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> from the islands of the Aegean and Ionian seas. The <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of these islands are largely descendants of the Western conquers who held possession of the islands for two or three centuries, or even longer, beginning with the <a href="04543c.htm#section4">Fourth Crusade</a>. As a rule, they are of <a href="15333a.htm">Venetian</a> and <a href="06419a.htm">Genoese</a> descent. In these islands some of the native Greeks, on account of the higher social and political standing of the foreign element, accepted the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="05752c.htm">Faith</a> and obedience. From these converted Greeks some <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the Diocese of Athens are now descended. On three or four of the islands, outside of the Diocese of Athens, there are many such <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who are pure Greeks, being descended from converts to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the time of the foreign <a href="06058c.htm">feudal</a> governments. These <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the islands are the nucleus of the future prosperity of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a>, for gradually they are identifying themselves with the good of the country and its worthier ideals. Although they are still conscious of their foreign extraction, or former foreign sympathies, they now feel that their residence of centuries in Greek territory has made them Greeks. The real foreign element is made up of those <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who have migrated into <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a> since it has become a free country. These are chiefly <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a> and Maltese. Most of them are laborers who came to find employment on the railroads and other public works, or to live as fishermen or boatmen in the larger seaport towns. The exact number of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> cannot easily be estimated. Possibly in the entire Diocese of Athens there are about 10,000, of whom about one fourth attend church regularly. From amongst the members of the <a href="06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> no converts are made to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>. At least, they are extremely rare. It is against the positive and explicit law of the State for any other church to make <a href="12481c.htm">proselytes</a> from the established Greek or <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. In the first National Assembly, which was held at Epidavros in 1822, it was declared that the <a href="11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> is the State Church. This declaration was repeated in the Assembly at Troezen in 1827. Such has been the strict law ever since. But, except that propagandism is severely prohibited, the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> is perfectly free, it is fairly treated, and highly respected.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>Otho of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the first king of regenerated Greece, was a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. In his reign the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were few. But arrangements were made that the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could have a place of worship wherever they existed in sufficient numbers. After Athens became the seat of government, in 1834, an abandoned <a href="15097a.htm">Turkish</a> mosque was given to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as a place of worship. It is still used as a church, and is attended chiefly by Maltese and <a href="08208a.htm">Italians</a> who live in and around the Old Market, near the Tower of the Winds. Mass is said there on <a href="14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and Holy Days by a <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> from the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. After the lapse of some years, in 1876, an <a href="01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> was established in Athens. Those who have occupied this see are <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Marangos, Zaffino, De Angelis, and Delendas. De Angelis was an Italian; Zaffino a native of <a href="04362a.htm">Corfu</a>; all the other <a href="01691a.htm">archbishops</a> were born in the Aegean Islands. Within the Diocese of Athens there are now eight churches. Of these two are in Athens, and there is one In each of the towns of Peiraevs (the harbor of Athens); Patrae, the chief town of the Peloponnesos; Volos, the seaport of Thessaly; Lavrion (Ergasteria), in the silver mines of Attica; Herakleion, a <a href="02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> settlement in Attica; and Navplion in the Argolid. Most of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, however, are concentrated at Athens, Peiraevs, and in Athens, one is the ancient mosque which Otho donated to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the other is the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Dionysios. It is a stone structure in basilica style, with a portico in front supported by marble columns. The interior is divided into three <a href="10724a.htm">naves</a> separated from each other by rows of columns of Tenian marble. The <a href="01659a.htm">apse</a> has been frescoed. This <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built with money sent from abroad, especially from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Besides the regular <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> there are missions here and there. Some years ago there were missions at Kalamata, Pyrgos, and Kalamaki. The only considerable one at present is at Lamis. Within the Diocese of Athens there are at present eleven <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> engaged in <a href="11499b.htm">parochial</a> work: four at the <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in Athens, two at Patrae, and one at each of the churches of Peiraevs, Lavrion, Volos, Herskleion, and Navplion. All of them are <a href="13675a.htm">secular priests</a>.</p>

<p><a href="06166a.htm">French</a> sisters conduct <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls in Athens and at the Peiraevs, and Italian sisters have <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls at Patrae. They have boarders as well as day scholars. In the town of the Peiraevs there is a good <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> for boys conducted by French <a href="13398b.htm">Salesian Fathers</a>. Boarders and day scholars are accommodated, and both classical and commercial courses are given. But the most important <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the Leonteion at Athens, founded by <a href="09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, to supply ordinary and <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> for all Greek-speaking <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It embraces a preparatory department, an intermediate or "hellenic" <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> a gymnasium or college, and an <a href="13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>. The average number of pupils and students for the past five years is about 175. The faculty consists of both <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a>. In its character as <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a>, the Leonteion receives students from other <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> as well as from that of Athens. Previous to the establishment of the Leonteion, candidates for the <a href="12409a.htm">priesthood</a> were <a href="05295b.htm">educated</a> chiefly in the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> which existed in the Aegean town of <a href="14395a.htm">Syra</a>. The <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="14395a.htm">Syra</a> has been closed, and it is now intended that all <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> training be given in the Leonteion and the <a href="12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>.</p>

<p>The only publication of note for the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of this <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the "Harmonia," a periodical devoted to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. The "Harmonia" is supported chiefly by a subsidy from <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>. One does not expect to find a large number of noted scholars in so small a <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community. But all the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> are men of wide <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. Every one of them, with other accomplishments, speaks two or three other languages as well as the vernacular Greek of the country. Amongst the <a href="08748a.htm">laymen</a> special mention should be made of the brothers Kyparissos Stephanos and Klon Stephanos. Kyparissos, a mathematician whose fame extended far beyond the confines of <a href="06735a.htm">Greece</a>, was made a professor in the National University. His brother Klon, an anthropologist of repute, engaged in special historical, archeological, and anthropological researches, became director of the Anthropological Museum of Athens. There are in Greece no <a href="05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Greek</a> <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. All are of the <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a>. This is because most of these <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are from the West, either by descent or by birth, and they have kept their own Western rite. It might be better for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Greece if the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were to adopt the native rite, and to have their liturgy in the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language of the country. But many of the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Athens would never willingly accept such a change, which they would regard rather from a national than from a religious point of view, and would consider a denial of their Italian, or other Western, origin.</p>
