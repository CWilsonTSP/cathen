<p>A<font size=-2>RCHDIOCESE OF CARTHAGE</font> (C<font size=-2>ARTHAGINIENSIS</font>)</p>

<p>The city of Carthage, founded by <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> colonists, and long the great opponent of <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the <a href="05184b.htm">duel</a> for supremacy in the civilized world, was destroyed by a Roman army, 146 B.C. A little more than a century later (44 B.C.), a new city composed of Roman colonists was founded by Julius C&aelig;sar on the site of Carthage, and became the capital of the Roman province of Africa Nova, which included the province of Africa Vetus, as well as Numidia. From this date Roman Africa made rapid progress in prosperity and became one of the most flourishing colonies of the empire.</p>

<p>The history of <a href="01191a.htm">African Christianity</a> opens in the year 180 with the accounts of two groups of <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who suffered at <a href="13609a.htm">Scillium</a>, a city of Numidia, and <a href="09512a.htm">Madaura</a>. Twenty years later a flourishing Church existed in Carthage, already the centre of <a href="01191a.htm">Christianity in Africa</a>. In his "Apology", written at Carthage about 197, <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> states that although but of yesterday the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> "have filled every place among you [the <a href="06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>] &mdash; cities, islands, fortresses, towns, market-places, the very camp, tribes, companies, palaces, senate, forum; we have left nothing to you but the <a href="14495a.htm">temples</a> of your gods". If the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> should be in a body <a href="04749a.htm">desert</a> the cities of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the governing authorities would be "horror-stricken at the solitude" in which they would find themselves, "at a silence so all pervading", a stupor as of a dead world (Apol., xxxvii). Fifteen years later the same author asks the Proconsul Scapula: "What will you make of so many thousands, of such a multitude of men and <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of every age, sex and rank, when they present themselves before you? How many fires, how many swords will be required?" And with regard to the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the African capital he inquires: "What will be the anguish of Carthage itself, which you will have to decimate, as each one recognizes there is relatives and companions; as he sees there, it may be, men of your own order, and noble ladies, and all the leading <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> of the city, and either kinsmen or friends of those in your own circle? Spare thyself, if not us poor <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Spare Carthage, if not thyself" (<a href="../fathers/0305.htm"><em>To Scapula</em> 5</a>). It is clear from this that the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> at the beginning of the third century must have had numerous adherents in all ranks of Carthaginian <a href="14074a.htm">society</a>; <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, if the contrary were the case, would merely have stultified himself by making a claim which could have been so easily disproved. A council of seventy <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> held at Carthage by <a href="01232a.htm">Bishop Agrippinus</a> at the epoch (variously dated between 198 and 222), substantially corroborates the testimony of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> as to the general progress of <a href="01191a.htm">Christianity in Africa</a> in the early years of the third century. It is impossible to say whence came the first preachers of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Roman Africa. It is worthy of note in this regard, however, that from the moment when <a href="01191a.htm">African Christianity</a> comes into historical prominence, the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Roman Africa are seen in very close relations with the <a href="07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>. The faithful of Carthage in particular were "greatly interested in all that happened at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>; every movement of <a href="07630a.htm">ideas</a>, every occurrence bearing on discipline, ritual, literature, that took place at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> was immediately re-echoed at Carthage" (Duchesne, Hist. Anc. De l'&Eacute;glise, I, 392; cf. Leclecq, L'Afrique chr&eacute;t., I, iii). Indeed, during the last decade of the second century the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> was governed by an African, <a href="15409a.htm">Pope Victor</a> (189-199).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The two greatest names in the <a href="07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> of Carthage are those of <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. The former comes on the scene, in the troubled days of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>, as an able and valiant defender of his religion. He was born at Carthage, about the year 160. In his youth he devoted himself to the study of <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> and literature, and thus obtained the <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> training which was to prove of the greatest service to his future coreligionists. His conversion appears to have been influenced by the heroism of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and one of his earliest treatises was an exhortation to those ready to die for the <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> (Ad martyres). His first work was a severe arraignment of <a href="11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="12223b.htm">polytheism</a> (Ad nationes), and this was followed in a short time (197) by his "Apologeticus", addressed to the imperial authorities. The latter work was calm in tone, "a model of judicial discussion" (Bardenhewer). Unlike previous apologists of <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, whose appeals for tolerance were made in the name of reason and humanity, <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, influenced by his legal training, spoke as a jurist convinced of the <a href="08010c.htm">injustice</a> of the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> under which the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were <a href="11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. The "Apologeticus" was written before the edict of <a href="13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> (202), and consequently, the <a href="09053a.htm">laws</a> to which the writer took exception were those under which the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the first and second centuries had been convicted. From the year of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="13609a.htm">Scillium</a> and Madaura (180) the <a href="01191a.htm">Christians of Africa</a> were not molested by the authorities for nearly two decades. But in 197 or 198 the governors recommenced the legal pursuit of the followers of <a href="08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who soon filled the <a href="12430a.htm">prisons</a> of Carthage. <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> encouraged the "blessed <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> designate" by what he termed a contribution to their spiritual sustenance (Ad martyres, i), and at the same time protested against the <a href="08010c.htm">unjust</a> measures of which they were the victims. But the magistrates took no heed of his protests. <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> were daily condemned to exile, torture, death, and, in at least one instance, to a still more dreaded fate (Apol., 1). In 202 the new anti-Christian legislation of <a href="13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> appeared in the form of an edict which forbade anybody to become a <a href="08399a.htm">Jew</a> or a <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a>. According to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> at this period was recruited chiefly by conversion (<em>fiunt, non nascuntur Christiani</em>, Apol., xviii); the new law, consequently, aimed at cutting off this fertile source of membership, by imposing the <a href="12565a.htm">death penalty</a> both on converts and on those who were the instruments of their conversion. Among the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrs</a> executed at Carthage under the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> of Severus were the young matron Vibia Perpetua and the slave Felicitas, the Acts of whose <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which, perhaps, we owe to <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (Duchesne, op. cit., I, 394), is one of the "jewels of ancient <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature". Throughout the trying period inaugurated by the new legislation (202-213), during which the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a> was enforced with more or less severity according to the disposition of the governor of the moment, <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> was the central figure of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Carthage. His rigorism indeed drew him, about the opening year of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>, into the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, but in spite of this lapse he appears not to have lost for many years the confidence of the <a href="11330a.htm">orthodox</a>; as late as 212 he wrote his letter to the Proconsul Scapula in the name of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Carthage (Leclercq, op. cit., I, 165). It was only in the following year (213) that he broke definitively with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> and became the head of an obscure <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a>, called after him "Tertullianists", which maintained a precarious existence till the age of <a href="02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>.</p>

<p>From this time to the election of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (249) little is known of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Carthage. The Acts of Sts. Perpetua and Felicitas mention a certain Optatus, who was Bishop either of Carthage or Thuburbo minus. <a href="01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, already mentioned, was <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carthage about 197, and the immediate predecessor of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> was Donatus, who presided over a council of ninety African <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> which condemned as a <a href="07256b.htm">heretic</a> Privatus, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lambesa. Like <a href="14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> was a convert to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; he was <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Carthage about 246. The period of his episcopate (249-258) is one of the most important, as well as the best known, in the annals of <a href="01191a.htm">Christianity in Africa</a>. A year after his elevation the edict of the <a href="04666a.htm">Emperor Decius</a> against the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> was <a href="12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, and its appearance was the signal for wholesale apostasy. During the long interval of peace since the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Severus the fervour of the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Carthage had suffered a notable decline. The time was therefore favourable for effecting the emperor's purpose, which was to compel the <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> to renounce their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> and offer sacrifice on the altars of the gods. In the early stages of the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> capital punishment was not resorted to, except in the case of <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but the mere threat of even less severe penalties induced large numbers to comply with the <a href="09053a.htm">law</a>. Many others, however, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> themselves worthy of their religion and died heroically.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>At the beginning of the storm, <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, knowing that as <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> he would be one of the first victims, and judging that in a time so perilous it was his <a href="05215a.htm">duty</a> for the moment to preserve his life for the good of his flock, retired to a secure refuge. His motives were not, however, correctly construed by some of his people, and even the Roman <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> who directed the chief Church of Christendom after the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="05742d.htm">Pope Fabian</a> (236-250) made a rather uncomplimentary allusion, in a letter to the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Carthage, to "the Good Shepherd and the hireling". <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> was naturally offended at the tone of this missive, and easily <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> to the satisfaction of the Romans that they had misjudged him. But the difficulties which arose in Carthage itself during his retirement were not so easily overcome. In the absence of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> five <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> hostile to him took it upon themselves to receive back <a href="01624b.htm">apostates</a> (<em><a href="09001b.htm">lapsi</a>, libellatici</em>) into communion, merely on the recommendation of confessors awaiting <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in <a href="12430a.htm">prison</a>. The intercession of confessors for the fallen was then customary, and was always regarded by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> as a reason for remitting part of the canonical penance for apostasy. But in Carthage at this time some of the confessors seem to have regarded themselves as having practically superseded the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and issued letters of communion in a tone of command. One of them, for example, gave a note ordering the restoration of the bearer and his friends to communion (<em>communicet ille cum suis</em>). <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> objected to this usurpation of his authority, which, if not resisted, would destroy the <a href="03744a.htm">Church's</a> discipline, and he was supported in this attitude by the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and confessors of the <a href="07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. On this Novatus, one of the rebellious <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, set out for <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> to obtain, if possible, support for his party. But the <a href="13529a.htm">schismatical</a> envoy at first met with no success. Eventually, however, he won over the <a href="12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a> and some of the Roman confessors. The object of the alliance was to elect a "confessors' pope", who would support a "confessors' bishop", to be elected in Carthage in opposition to <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>. The allies were, however, defeated at the outset by the election of <a href="04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a>, who was on the side of <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>. But this check did not at all dispose them to yield; they proceeded to elect an <a href="01582a.htm">antipope</a> in the <a href="11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a>. Meanwhile <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> had returned to Carthage, where he convened a council of African <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the purpose of dealing with the question of the <em><a href="09001b.htm">lapsi</a></em>. The decision of the council was moderate: all <a href="01624b.htm">apostates</a> who repented their fall were admitted to penance, which should last a greater or less time according to the degree of their guilt. The <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> to this effect was confirmed by a Roman council under <a href="04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a>. But now, curiously enough, <a href="11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, who had taken the part of the laxists of Carthage, became a rigorist; he admitted <a href="01624b.htm">apostates</a> to penance, indeed, but without hope of reconciliation with the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, even at the point of death. His views, however, were received with little favour, and eventually, through the efforts of <a href="05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, and <a href="04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a>, the Roman confessors from whom he had derived his prestige deserted his party and were admitted to communion. The attempts to organize a <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> in Carthage were no more successful. <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> was supported by all the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa, with five exceptions, three of whom were <a href="01624b.htm">apostates</a> and two <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>The years 255-257 witnessed a controversy between <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Carthage on a question of discipline which for a short time produced strained relations between these two great centres of <a href="09022a.htm">Latin Christianity</a>. The trouble arose over the different modes in vogue in <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in Africa of receiving into communion <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="13674a.htm">sects</a>. In <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> conferred by <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> was per se admitted to be valid; in Africa such <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> was regarded a wholly invalid. The matter was allowed to drop after the death of <a href="14288a.htm">Pope Stephen</a> (2 August, 257). Africans and Romans preserved their respective practices till the fourth century, when the former, at the Synod of Arles (314), agreed to conform to the Roman custom (<a href="07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, Hist. Of the Councils, I, 188). <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> died a <a href="09736b.htm">martyr</a> in the <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="15256b.htm">Valerian</a>, September, 258.</p>

<p>From this date to the outbreak of the last <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a> under <a href="05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, in 303, very little is known of the <a href="07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> of Carthage. Two of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> who succeeded <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, Carpophorus and Lucian, in this period of forty-five years are mentioned by Optatus, but nothing is related of them save their names. The worldly spirit which had been the cause of so many defections in the African Church of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> age was equally in evidence in the early part of the fourth century. A new form of apostasy characterized this <a href="11703a.htm">persecution</a>. In large numbers <a href="03712a.htm">Christians</a> betrayed their <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> by giving up to the <a href="02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> copies of the Scriptures and the <a href="09306a.htm">liturgical</a> utensils. These renegades, who received the name of "traditors", were indirectly the cause of the gravest division that had yet been seen in <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. The <a href="05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> originated in the <a href="04276a.htm">consecration</a> of C&aelig;cilian as <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carthage (311) by Felix of Aptunga, who was falsely accused as having been a traditor. Its effects on the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> of Africa were disastrous. The obstinacy of the <a href="05121a.htm">Donatists</a> kept the <a href="13529a.htm">schism</a> alive for more than a century, and it was only the intervention of the <a href="07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> in 405 that dealt it a death-blow. The civil penalties then inflicted on the schismatics brought them back to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> in large numbers, although the <a href="13674a.htm">sect</a> still existed in 429, when Carthage was taken by the <a href="15268b.htm">Vandals</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="15268b.htm">Vandal</a> occupation of <a href="01181a.htm">Africa</a>, which lasted over a century (429-534), was a period of severe trial to the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of that country. The disorganization of the African Church was arrested by the re-conquest under Justinian of this portion of the empire, but the <a href="07256b.htm">heresies</a> which, during the sixth and seventh centuries, <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> so fruitful in dissensions affected this portion of <a href="03699b.htm">Christendom</a> like the rest. The final catastrophe came with the fall of Carthage into the hands of the <a href="01663a.htm">Arabs</a> in 698. From this time the once flourishing church of Africa is rarely heard of. Apostasy became the order of the day, and in 1053 only five <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> remained in the former proconsulate.</p>

<h2>Primacy of Carthage</h2>

<p>In the time of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> the Bishops of Carthage exercised a real though not official primacy in the African Church. Roman Africa at this period consisted of three provinces: (1) the province of Africa proper, which comprised the proconsulate, Byzacena and Tripoli; (2) Numidia; (3) Mauretania. These three civil divisions formed in the middle of the third century but one <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. In 305 a <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Numidia is mentioned for the first time, and in the course of the fourth century Byzacena, Tripoli, and the Mauretanias each obtained an <em>episcopus prim&aelig; sedis</em>. These later <a href="12423b.htm">primatial</a> sees were, however, of little importance; their <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> presided over the <a href="12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>, appointed delegates to the annual councils of Carthage, received the appeals of the <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> of their provinces, and gave letters of travel (<em>litter&aelig; format&aelig;</em>) to the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> who wished to visit <a href="08208a.htm">Italy</a> (Synod of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, 393, can. xxvii). The provincial <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> had the right, if they preferred, to ignore their immediate <a href="10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and appeal directly to the <a href="12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Carthage. At first the provincial primacy devolved <em>ipso facto</em> on the senior <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province, but as this method <a href="12454c.htm">proved</a> a source of dispute the synod of <a href="07360b.htm">Hippo</a> of 393 (can. iv) decreed that in case of difference of opinion among the provincial <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="12423b.htm">primate</a> should be "appointed in accordance with the advice of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carthage". It was the right of the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carthage also to determine, a year in advance, the date for the celebration of <a href="05224d.htm">Easter</a>.</p>

<h2>Councils of Carthage</h2>

<p>The earliest council of Carthage of which we <a href="08673a.htm">know</a> was held about 198 (?); seventy <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, presided over by the <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carthage, <a href="01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, were present. According to <a href="04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> the question of the validity of <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> conferred by <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a> came up for discussion and was decided in the negative. Afer this date more than twenty councils were held in Carthage, the most important of which were: (1) those under <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> relative to the <em><a href="09001b.htm">lapsi</a></em>, <a href="11138a.htm">Novatianism</a>, and the rebaptism of <a href="07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and (2) the <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> of 412, 416, and 418 which condemned the doctrines of <a href="11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>. (See <a href="01199a.htm">AFRICAN SYNODS</a>.)</p>

<h2>Bishops of Carthage</h2>

<p>The Acts of the <a href="09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Sts. Perpetua and Felicitas mentioned, as noted above, a Bishop Optatus, who, if he was a <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carthage, as is generally supposed, is the first known incumbent of this see. It is possible, however, that Optatus was <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Thuburbo minus, and, if so, <a href="01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, who was <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 197, heads the list of Bishops of Carthage. From this date to the election of <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (249) we know of only two Bishops of Carthage, Cyrus and Donatus. After <a href="04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (249-258) the succession so far as known (cf. Leclercq, op. cit., II, Appendix; Kirchenlex., II, 1998; Duchesne, op.cit. I, xx) is as follows: between 258 and 311 Carpophorus, Lucian, and Mensurius; C&aelig;cilian (311 till after 325); Gratus, at <a href="13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (344-), presided at <a href="01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (349); Restitutus, at <a href="13057b.htm">Council of Rimini</a> (359); Aurelius (391), presided at <a href="01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (421); Capreolus (431); Quodvultdeus (437); Deogratias (454-458); Eugenius (481, exiled 496); Boniface (523-535); Repartatus (535, banished 551); Primosus or Primasius (553 till after 565); Publianus (581); Dominicus (591); Fortunius (632); Victor (635). After this date no <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carthage is heard of till the middle of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>After eight centuries of abeyance the archiepiscopal See of Carthage was restored by <a href="09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (19 Nov., 1884) and confided to <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> (later <a href="03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) <a href="09050d.htm">Lavigerie</a>, to whose <a href="15753a.htm">zeal</a> it was owing that since 1875 the ancient site of Carthage became again a centre of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> life (see <a href="02352a.htm">Baunard</a>, Le Cardinal Lavigerie, Paris, 1898, <em>passim</em>). The territory of the new archdiocese, hitherto administered by <a href="08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, was enlarged by <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> 31 March, 1885, and now includes the entire Regency (French Protectorate) of <a href="15088a.htm">Tunis</a>. By another <a href="04670a.htm">decree</a> of 28 March, 1886 the eighteen titular canons of the new chapter and their successors enjoy the dignity of <a href="12260a.htm">papal</a> chamberlains. A magnificent <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was dedicated by <a href="09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a> (15 May, 1890) on the famous Hill of Byrsa, in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Louis IX of <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>; connected with it are several charitable and <a href="13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>. A council of Carthage was held 20 April, 1890, in which the decrees of the Council of <a href="01311a.htm">Algiers</a> (1873) were renewed and applied to the new <a href="12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. The archdiocese counts at present about 35,000 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in a <a href="10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> population of 1,600,000; it has fifty-four <a href="11499b.htm">parishes</a> (cures) and fourteen vicariates. It was also owing to <a href="09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a> that the famous excavations on the site of ancient Carthage were begun about 1880 by one of his missionaries, Father Delattre. They were originally carried on at the <a href="03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> expense, and for some time the <a href="03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Louis served as a museum for the preservation of the antiquities discovered. Apart from the light thrown by these excavations on the <a href="12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> and Roman life of ancient Carthage, the discoveries of Father Delattre have greatly increased our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="01191a.htm">early Christian life of Africa</a>, particularly in the fourth and fifth centuries. Many <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> epitaphs and inscriptions have been made known, the <a href="05257a.htm">Christian architecture</a> of the period has been illustrated by the ground-plans of ancient <a href="02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, some of them quite famous in <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity (e.g. the Basilica Major of Carthage), while <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> burial customs and domestic life have had fresh light thrown on them; in a word, the importance of these excavations for our <a href="08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity is second only to that of <a href="04739c.htm">De Rossi's</a> epoch-making discoveries at <a href="13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>
