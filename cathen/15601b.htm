<p>A province of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> situated between the Rhine and the Weser. It is bounded on the northwest and north by the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, on the east by Schaumburg-Lippe, <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, Lippe-Detmold, <a href="03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>, Hesse-Nassau, and Waldeck, on the south and southwest by Hesse-Nassau, on the west by the province of the Rhine and the <a href="10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. It is the tenth in size and the third in population of the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> provinces, having an area of 7804 square miles, and 4,125,096 inhabitants. Of its population 2,121,534 are <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 1,947,672 Evangelicals. The province has 107 cities and 1468 village communities. In the south and northeast it is mountainous, in the other sections it is level. The chief industries are agriculture, breeding of cattle, mining, and manufactures. The industrial section on the Ruhr River contains the most productive coal beds of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a> and also the most valuable iron mines. Consequently this district is the seat of the most extensive mining industry, large iron forges, and innumerable factories for the manufacture of machinery and the working of iron. The relatively small district of 386 square miles contains some twenty towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants with altogether a population of 750,000. The other manufactures are chiefly linen and other textile products. 53.4 per cent of the inhabitants make their living in mining and manufacturing industries, 26.2 per cent in agriculture, 10 per cent in commerce and traffic. Still 42.4 per cent of the area is given up to farming and gardening.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>In the earliest era the province was inhabited by the German tribes of the Sicambri, Bructeri, <a href="09718c.htm">Marsi</a>, and Cherusci. For a short time it was held by the Romans, having been conquered by Drusus and <a href="14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, the sons of <a href="02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, in a series of campaigns during the years 12 B.C. to A.D. 5. The Romans were defeated in the great battle in the Teutoburg Forest (A.D. 9), and Germanicus was not able to reconquer the country. In the third century the Saxons pushed their way into the province from the Cimbrian peninsula; other tribes joined them, either <a href="15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> or under compulsion, and thus there arose a large confederation of tribes which bore the name of Saxons. The western part of the province between the Weser and the Lower Rhine appears from about the year 800 in the historical sources under the name of Westphalia, while the district on both banks of the Weser was called Engern, and the district between the Weser and the Elbe bore the name of Eastphalia. In the later <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the name Engern disappeared and the region of the Weser was then considered a part of Westphalia. No one has yet been able to give a satisfactory explanation of the names Westphalia and Eastphalia. Among the various meanings suggested have been: <em>f&acirc;l</em>, horse; <em>fale</em>, inhabitant of a lowland; <em>vallum</em>, boundary wall, etc.</p>

<p>The Westphalians were brought into contact with <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the seventh century. The first apostles (about A.D. 695) were the two <a href="05672a.htm">Ewalds</a>, known from the colour of their hair as the White and the Black Ewald. However, the account of <a href="02384a.htm">Bede</a> (Hist. eccl. gent. Angl., lib. V, c.x) is uncertain and contradictory. At a later date the conversion of the Saxons especially engaged the attention of <a href="02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. He was not, however, able to carry out his desire, although Westphalian folk-lore has stories of the preaching of <a href="02656a.htm">Boniface</a> and even of his founding of churches. Probably, even though the <a href="12454c.htm">proof</a> is lacking, the attempts to found missions among the Saxons proceeded from Cologne. No permanent success was gained by the campaigns of the <a href="06238a.htm">Frankish</a> King Pepin (751-68) against the Saxons. The country was finally subdued after several bloody <a href="15546c.htm">wars</a> (772-804) by Pepin's son <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who, as an apostle of the sword, brought the Saxons to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The questions asked the Saxon candidates for <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> are still in existence, as well as the answers that were to be made in which they were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to renounce the gods Donar, Wodan, and Saxnot. The <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the Saxon Duke Widukind (785) was of much importance; for after <a href="02258b.htm">baptism</a> he was unswervingly loyal to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and its <a href="15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoter. The same is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> of the Westphalians in general. After they had once accepted the <a href="03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>, which "had been preached to them with an iron tongue by their bitterest enemies", hardly any other people were as loyally and devotedly attached to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> chief assistants in the missionary work were Sturm (who converted the country around <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>), Lebwin (who brought the western districts of Westphalia to <a href="03712a.htm">Christianity</a>), and Liudger (who converted the district surrounding M&uuml;nster). At the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth centuries the missionary districts of <a href="11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, <a href="10323a.htm">Minden</a>, and <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> were raised to <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The southern part of the province, in the neighbourhood of Ruhr and Lippe, fell to the <a href="04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>. Louis the Pious continued the work of his <a href="11478c.htm">father</a>. During his reign the first <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were founded; the most celebrated of these are the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Corvey (815), and the Abbey of Herford (819) for <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="11164a.htm">nuns</a>.</p>

<p>Westphalia, as has already been said, was only a part of <a href="13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, and in about the year 900 Saxony was made a duchy, after Ludolf, the ancestor of the ducal house, had been made a margrave in 850 during the reign of Louis the German. The duchy continued to exist until 1180. The last and greatest of the dukes was Henry the Lion, who lost the duchy through disloyalty to the emperor. This led to the division of Westphalia into numerous principalities. The southern part, the "Sauerland", fell as the Duchy of Westphalia to the <a href="04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a> which retained it until 1803. This duchy had its own constitution and its own diet. The head of the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government was the court of the officiality. Up to 1434 the court was held at Arnsberg, and after that at Werl. The attempts of the <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Cologne to extend the ducal power even over the northern part of the province were unsuccessful. Instead of the <a href="08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Cologne, the Bishops of M&uuml;nster, <a href="11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, and Minden, who had long had secular sovereignty, became independent ruling princes. At the same time numerous smaller principalities were created, such as the countships of Mark, Ravensberg, Tecklenburg, Rietberg, and Steinfurt, the free imperial city of Dortmund, the principality of the <a href="01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Corvey. In 1394 the Countship of Mark was united with Cleves. In 1346 the Countship of Ravensberg was united with Julich and in 1511 also with Cleves. In this article the Diocese of Osnabr&uuml;ck, as is generally the case, is not taken into consideration, although it belongs to the original territory of Westphalia and in earlier ages included large districts of the present <a href="05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of M&uuml;nster and <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, because from 1648 it was entirely independent, and in 1815 it became a part of the Kingdom of <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a> with which, in 1866, it was incorporated into <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>.</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In the meantime the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had developed in all directions. The number of <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and religious foundations that were established during the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> exceeded 250. Among these should be mentioned: the <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> at Grafschaft (1072), Marienm&uuml;nster (1128), St. Moritz at <a href="10323a.htm">Minden</a> (1042), Abdinghof at <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> (1015); the <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> at Bredclar (1196), Hardchausen (1140), and Marienfeld (1185); the <a href="12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> at Kappenberg (1122), Klarholz (1133), and Varlar (1128); the Augustinian <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at <a href="11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> (1288), Herford (before 1288), and Lippstadt (1281); the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Dortmund (1310), Minden (1236), M&uuml;nster (1346), Soest (1231), and Warburg (1280); the <a href="06281a.htm">Minorite</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Soest (1232), <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> (1232), M&uuml;nster (about 1247), and Herford (1223?). In the <a href="08084c.htm">Conflict of Investitures</a> the Westphalian <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with few exceptions, held to the Emperors <a href="07230a.htm">Henry IV</a> and Henry V, and only at times, and then under strong compulsion, did they support the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the same way they were partisans of <a href="06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick I</a> (1152-90) in his quarrel with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. During the reign of <a href="06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (1215-1250), on the contrary, they were actively connected with the <a href="12260a.htm">pope</a>. The strong religious feeling of the <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> Westphalians is shown by the large number of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions dependent upon the charity of the people. Thus Lippstadt, with a population of 2700, had four <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, and there were <a href="07480a.htm">hospitals</a> in very small places. Numerous <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> were undertaken as far as <a href="14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Many also took part in the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. In 1217 one of the leaders was Count Gottfried II of Arnsberg. In the fourteenth century the object of the <a href="04543c.htm">Crusades</a> was the <a href="11388a.htm">heathen</a> land of the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussians</a>. Thus in 1337 the Counts of Lippe, Arnsberg, and Wittgenstein joined the expeditions against the <a href="12519c.htm">Prussians</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> Werner Rolevinck (b. in 1425 in the District of M&uuml;nster; d. in 1502) said of his countrymen: "I am bold to assert that the people are genuinely <a href="12748a.htm">pious</a>, especially in <a href="05789c.htm">fasting</a>, in hearing the Divine Word, in attendance at church, in the acceptance of their <a href="11537b.htm">pastors</a>, in frequent <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, in the giving of <a href="01328f.htm">alms</a>, hospitality to strangers, and other works of <a href="03592a.htm">Christian charity</a>". It is probable, however, that Rolevinck describes the beautiful and earlier period of the fathers. At the beginning of the fourteenth century Westphalia was in a terrible state of disorganization caused by the political schemes of its <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> princes, as, for instance, by the three counts of Mors who occupied the <a href="05001a.htm">sees</a> of Cologne, <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, <a href="11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, and M&uuml;nster, or more especially by the Soest feud (1441-49), and the M&uuml;nster feud (150-56). After 1456 better conditions prevailed for a time; order was restored in the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> encouraged <a href="12748b.htm">religious life</a>; the <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="14388a.htm">synods</a> were more regularly held, and favourably influenced both <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. But conditions again grew bad when suddenly, in the year 1508, all the Westphalian sees were vacant and the former competent <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> were succeeded by <a href="11726a.htm">persons</a> unequal to the <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a> of their office. Until towards the end of the <a href="10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Westphalia in <a href="08066a.htm">intellectual</a> matters was under the influence of Cologne and its <a href="15188a.htm">university</a>. Yet in the era of <a href="07538b.htm">Humanism</a> a vigorous independent life was developed in the province. Many Westphalians attended the <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> at Deventer which flourished under the guidance of Alexander Hegius, a native of Westphalia. At M&uuml;nster, Rudolf of Langen and Johannes Murmellius exerted an active and far-reaching influence for the spread of <a href="07538b.htm">humanistic</a> training. The Westphalian Hermann von dem Busche was one of the greatest wanderers among the itinerant <a href="07538b.htm">humanistic</a> teachers. Although a eulogist like Hermann Hamelmann goes too far when he asserts, as Hamelmann continually does, that the Westphalians were the first to revive Classical learning in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, nevertheless a large share must be ascribed to them in this revival.</p>

<p>During the first years of the era of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> Westphalia was little affected. It is <a href="15073a.htm">true</a> that here, as elsewhere in <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>, a strong anti-clerical opposition had been in existence for a long time, but this antagonism did not at once join the new dogmatic opposition of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a>. The revolts which in 1525 arose in <a href="10323a.htm">Minden</a> and M&uuml;nster, were social in the main, and were aimed both against abuses in the lives of the upper and lower <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a> which were inconsistent with the dignity of the <a href="04049b.htm">clerical</a> calling and which had become intolerable, and against historically sanctioned privileges of <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in civil and political affairs. The earliest adherents of <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> in Westphalia were Augustinian <a href="10487b.htm">monks</a> and Humanists. The Augustinians studied at the <a href="15678b.htm">University of Wittenberg</a> and brought the new <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> home with them. Thus in 1524 the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> opinions were preached at Lippstadt by the prior Westermann, and the <a href="09111a.htm">lector</a> Koiten, and at Herford by the prior Kropp. Among the Humanists who maintained the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> cause were Hermann Marburg von dem Busche, who watched and supported from Marburg the advance of the new <a href="05089a.htm">dogma</a> in his native region, Jacob Montanus at Herford, and a large number of <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> teachers of the younger generation of Humanists, as Gerhard Cotius, John Glandorp, and Adolf Clarenbach at M&uuml;nster. It was not until after 1525 that <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> gained ground among the common people in Westphalia. As the common people had little comprehension of the dogmatic controversies, the success of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> is rather explicable by the fact that the old popular opposition to the life and constitution of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> learned to look upon <a href="09438b.htm">Luther</a> as its leader. The adherents of the movement continually grew in number by means of the accounts given by itinerant merchants, by the agitation carried on by preachers and students of <a href="15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> University, and by popular literature. Among the cities, Lippstadt, Soest, and Herford were the first to introduce the Evangelical Confession; Tecklenburg was the first of the countships. The secular principalities gradually became <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. In the <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> principalities the position of the ruler was of great importance. M&uuml;nster was won for the new <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a> by the preacher Bernhard Rothmann; it was recognized as a <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> city by the <a href="02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the Treaty of 14 February, 1533. The <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a> was also established in a number of country towns in the <a href="10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>. However, in the years 1534-35, the <a href="01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> carried on their wild regime at <a href="10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, and their overthrow put an end for a time to the progress of the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a> and <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, Hermann von der Wied, sought to introduce the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in the Duchy of Westphalia and in the <a href="11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a>, but he was deposed in 1547 and his successor re-established <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in both districts. In Minden the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves were friends of the new <a href="05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, consequently <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was able to maintain itself. The check given by the Augsburg Interim (1548) to <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was only a partial and temporary one, especially as a number of the princes rejected it altogether. After the Religious Peace of Augsburg (1555) the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> lost Dortmund, a large part of the <a href="10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>, as is shown by the visitation of 1571, and <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, which was under the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lauenburg (1577-85).</p>

<p><a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> was also partially superseded by <a href="03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, as in the countships of Mark and Tecklenburg, in the <a href="10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>, and in Southern Westphalia (Wittgenstein and Nassau-Siegen), while the flourishing cities of Soest, Lippstadt, Herford, Bielefeld, and Dortmund held to the <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="05752c.htm">faith</a>, the stronghold and pattern of <a href="09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> being Soest. However, after the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> had been re-invigorated by the <a href="15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, it took more decisive steps against <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in Westphalia as well as other regions. Here also the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> deserve the most credit for the <a href="04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>. Their first <em>collegium</em> was established at <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> in 1580, the next at M&uuml;nster at 1589. During the following century other collegiate foundations and missions were added to these. By means of their gymnasial <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> they gained over the rising generation and brought large numbers back to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, in districts far beyond the places of their settlement, by means of missions, retreats, brotherhoods, and sodalities. The new <a href="03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> and <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, a fairly large number of which were founded between 1600 and 1650, exerted influence in the same manner. It must, however, be said, that the "secular arm" had a large share in the <a href="04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>, often a larger one than spiritual weapons. The exercise of the Evangelical religion was forbidden and the non-Catholic <a href="04049b.htm">clergy</a>, teachers, and officials were deposed and expelled. The <a href="04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> was begun in the <a href="10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a> by Bishop John von Hoya (1566-74), and brought to a victorious close by Ernst of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1585-1612), and Ferdinand of <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1612-50).</p>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>In <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> Henry of Lauenburg was followed by Theodore of F&uuml;rstenberg (1585-1618), who defeated the <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a> opposition by the taking of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> in 1604; he restored <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> with the aid of the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and gave the <a href="04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> a centre by founding the University of Paderborn in 1614. In 1623 <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> was once more entirely <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The <a href="01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Gebhard Truchess of Waldburg (1577-84), made a second fruitless attempt to introduce <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in the Duchy of Westphalia. The three successors of Truchess made the duchy once more completely <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The <a href="04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> was introduced in the domains of the Abbey of Corvey by the Prince Abbot Dietrich of Beringhauses (1585-1616), but it made little progress under the inactive and incapable Abbot Henry of Aschebrock (1616-1624), and Hoxter remained <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. In the same way the attempts of the dukes of Cleves, who had returned to the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a>, to drive <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> out of the countships of Mark and Ravensberg failed, especially as in 1614 both countships became a part of <a href="02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a>. Rietberg was completely regained for <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> by the conversion to <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of the heiress of the Countship of Rietberg, Sabina Katharina, and by her marriage with the convert John III of East Freisland, a grandson of King Gustavus Vasa. In 1610 the exercise of <a href="12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was forbidden in Rietberg. The ruler of Buren, Elizabeth, was converted in 1613; her son Moritz became a <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and presented his seigniorial domain to the order. The attempts to re-establish <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> which were undertaken during the <a href="14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, on account of the Edict of Restitution of 1629, had only a temporary success. Among these efforts were the one at <a href="10323a.htm">Minden</a>, where the <a href="14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> laboured for a short time and where in 1632 a <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held, and that at Herford.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Westphalia (1648) established as the basis of <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs the conditions of the year 1624. Accordingly, since then the territories of <a href="10323a.htm">Minden</a>, Ravensberg, Mark, Tecklenburg, Rheda, Hohenlimburg, Siegen-Hilchenbach, Wittgenstein, and the imperial city of Dortmund have been entirely or mainly <a href="12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, while M&uuml;nster, <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, the Duchy of Westphalia, and Rietberg have been <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The Countship of Steinfurt and the Seigniory of Gemen gradually became for the most part <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Until modern times territorial boundaries were also denominational boundaries, especially in Westphalia. With the present era the denominational compactness was broken by the growth of the cities and the immigration of large numbers of factory hands from all parts of <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1648 Brandenburg-Prussia received by the Treaty of Westphalia the <a href="10323a.htm">Diocese of Minden</a>, in 1702 the Countship of Lingen by inheritance from the line of Orange, and in 1707 the Countship of Tecklenburg by purchase. From the end of the seventeenth century to the beginning of the nineteenth century Church life was torpid and little progress was made. The <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters at M&uuml;nster and <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> withdrew more and more from their spiritual <a href="05215a.htm">duties</a>. From the fifteenth century they were open only to members of the old <a href="05782a.htm">families</a> of the nobility, of whom but a few were <a href="11279a.htm">ordained</a>. The others did not live differently from the secular nobility. The old <a href="02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> and <a href="03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a> had also become very worldly, but little was done for the training of their inmates in learning, although, in general, good discipline and order were maintained. Only the <a href="10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, especially the <a href="06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, laboured actively for the <a href="04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>. The system of <a href="13554b.htm">schools</a> was very defective. In the <a href="10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a> the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> founded by the Prince-Bishop Ferdinand in 1613 was allowed to fall into decay, so that the training of <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a> was very unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Much was done at the end of the eighteenth century for the improvement of <a href="05295b.htm">education</a> by the distinguished minister and Vicar- General of M&uuml;nster, <a href="06325a.htm">Freiherr Franz von F&uuml;rstenberg</a>. His work affected at first only the <a href="10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>, but the example had an influence on the whole of Westphalia, and indeed was felt throughout <a href="06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He reorganized the entire <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> system of M&uuml;nster from the lowest elementary instruction up to the <a href="15188a.htm">university</a> on a well constructed plan, founded the <a href="10639a.htm">University of M&uuml;nster</a> in 1771, re-established the <a href="13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="12406a.htm">priests</a>, and founded the normal <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> over which he placed Overberg. The era of the <a href="13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and of the <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> empire brought violent changes. On account of the Peace of Luneville (1801) and of the Enactment of the Imperial Delegation (1803), the secular sovereignty of the <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a> was suppressed and their territories used to compensate the princes who were <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to yield their possessions on the left bank of the Rhine to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. Thus <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> received the <a href="11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a> and a part of the <a href="10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a>, that is the half of the upper section of the <a href="05001a.htm">diocese</a> with the capital. The other half was used to form petty principalities for the Princes of Salm, Croy, and Looz-Corswaren; the lower diocese and the district called Emsland were given to the Dukes of Oldenburg and of Arenberg. The Duchy of Westphalia went to the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. The new rulers at once secularized the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for men, a right given them by the enactment of the imperial delegation. Thus in the spring of 1803 <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> suppressed the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Kapenberg, Marienfeld, Liesborn, Abdinghof, Hardehausen, Dalheim, and Boddeken. By an Edict of 17 October, 1803, Landgrave Louis of <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a> <a href="10453a.htm">suppressed the monasteries</a> in his territories.</p>

<p>In 1807 <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had to concede its Westphalian possessions to <a href="06166a.htm">France</a>. The western part of Westphalia was <a href="11189a.htm">obliged</a> to change its nationality several times, it belonged in part to the French Empire, in part to the Grand Duchy of Berg under Joachim Murat. The eastern section of Westphalia was made, in conjunction with territories taken from <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, <a href="07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, and Brunswick, into the Kingdom of Westphalia, the name of which was a misnomer, as the larger part of the new kingdom was composed of lands that were not Westphalian. The Kingdom of Westphalia was given to <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> brother Jerome. The French continued the secularization of the <a href="04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, nor did they spare the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a>. On 13 May, 1809, Jerome decreed the suppression of six <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> and on 1 November, 1809, ordered the suppression of all religious foundations, chapters, <a href="01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and <a href="12428b.htm">priories</a> with exception of those devoted to <a href="05295b.htm">education</a>. Similar decrees were issued by <a href="10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> himself on 14 November, 1811, for the territories of M&uuml;nster. As far as possible the lands were sold. In 1815, after the French had been driven out of the country, <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> received, besides its earlier possessions, the former Duchy of Westphalia, the Abbey of Corvey, the former free imperial city of Dortmund and a number of mediatised principalities and seigniories. In 1816 the Province of Westphalia was formed from these acquisitions. At a later date (18510 the whole of Lippstadt, which up to then had been divided between <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and Lippe, was added to the province. Under <a href="12519c.htm">Prussian</a> administration the province has reached a high degree of prosperity.</p>

<p>The life of the <a href="03744a.htm">Church</a> has also greatly developed in connection with the revival of German <a href="03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in general. There are in Westphalia a large number of religious, political, social, and charitable associations of <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and brotherhoods which are very active and have many thousand members. the <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press of Westphalia also is in a prosperous condition. There are 82 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers, of which the "Westf&auml;lischer Merkur" of M&uuml;nster, the "Westfalisches Volksblatt" of <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, and the "Tremonia" of Dortmund should be mentioned, besides numerous <a href="11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a>. A <a href="05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held at <a href="11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> in 1868 and at M&uuml;nster in 1897. Next to the province of the Rhine, Westphalia is the most important <a href="03449a.htm">Catholic</a> part of <a href="12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The <a href="03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> divisions have been so arranged by the <a href="03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De salute animarum" of 1821, that the <a href="10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a> includes the government district of M&uuml;nster, one <a href="11499b.htm">parish</a> in the government district of <a href="10323a.htm">Minden</a>, as well as three enclaves in the government district of Arnsberg; the County of K&ouml;nigssteele in the government district of Arnsberg belongs to the <a href="04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>, and all else to the <a href="11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a>. The government district of M&uuml;nster contains 800,302 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 182,044 Evangelicals; the government district of Arnsberg, 1,081,343 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 1,276,187 Evangelicals; the government district of <a href="10323a.htm">Minden</a>, 239,889 <a href="03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 489,441 Evangelicals.
