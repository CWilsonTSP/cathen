<p>(Incorrectly known as BRIDGET).</p>

<p>Born in 451 or 452 of princely ancestors at Faughart, near Dundalk, County Louth; d. 1 February, 525, at <a href="08636c.htm">Kildare</a>. Refusing many good offers of marriage, she became a <a href="11164a.htm">nun</a> and received the veil from St. Macaille. With seven other virgins she settled for a time at the foot of Croghan Hill, but removed thence to Druin Criadh, in the plains of Magh Life, where under a large oak tree she erected her subsequently famous Convent of <em>Cill-Dara</em>, that is, "the church of the oak" (now Kildare), in the present county of that name. It is exceedingly difficult to reconcile the statements of St. Brigid's biographers, but the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Lives of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> are at one in assigning her a slave mother in the court of her father Dubhthach, and <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> chieftain of Leinster. Probably the most ancient life of St. Brigid is that by St. Broccan Cloen, who is said to have died 17 September, 650. It is metrical, as may be seen from the following specimen:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ni bu Sanct Brigid suanach <br>Ni bu huarach im sheire D&eacute;, <br>Sech ni chiuir ni cossens <br>Ind n&oacute;eb dibad bethath che.</p> <div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>(Saint Brigid was not given to sleep, <br>Nor was she intermittent about <a href="06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="09397a.htm">love</a>; <br>Not merely that she did not buy, she did not seek for <br>The wealth of this world below, the holy one.)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="04094a.htm">Cogitosus</a>, a <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of Kildare in the eighth century, expounded the metrical life of St. Brigid, and versified it in good Latin. This is what is known as the "Second Life", and is an excellent example of <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> scholarship in the mid-eighth century. Perhaps the most interesting feature of <a href="04094a.htm">Cogitosus's</a> work is the description of the <a href="03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Kildare in his day: "Solo spatioso et in altum minaci proceritate porruta ac decorata pictis tabulis, tria intrinsecus habens oratoria ampla, et divisa parietibus tabulatis". The rood-screen was formed of wooden boards, lavishly decorated, and with beautifully decorated curtains. Probably the famous Round Tower of Kildare dates from the sixth century. Although St. Brigid was "veiled" or received by St. Macaille, at Croghan, yet, it is tolerably certain that she was <a href="12451b.htm">professed</a> by St. Mel of <a href="01699c.htm">Ardagh</a>, who also conferred on her abbatial powers. From Ardagh St. Macaille and St. Brigid followed St. Mel into the country of Teffia in <a href="10097a.htm">Meath</a>, including portions of Westmeath and Longford. This occurred about the year 468. St. Brigid's small oratory at Cill-Dara became the centre of religion and learning, and developed into a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city. She founded two monastic institutions, one for men, and the other for <a href="15687b.htm">women</a>, and appointed St. Conleth as spiritual <a href="11537b.htm">pastor</a> of them. It has been frequently stated that she gave <a href="08567a.htm">canonical jurisdiction</a> to St. Conleth, <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kildare, but, as Archbishop Healy points out, she simply "selected the person to whom the Church gave this jurisdiction", and her biographer tells us distinctly that she chose St. Conleth "to govern the church along with herself". Thus, for centuries, Kildare was ruled by a double line of abbot-bishops and of abbesses, the <a href="01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of Kildare being regarded as superioress general of the <a href="04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.</p>

<p>Not alone was St. Bridget a patroness of students, but she also founded a <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> of art, including metal work and illumination, over which St. Conleth presided. From the Kildare scriptorium came the wondrous book of the Gospels, which elicited unbounded praise from <a href="06568d.htm">Giraldus Cambrensis</a>, but which has disappeared since the <a href="12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. According to this twelfth- century ecclesiastic, nothing that he had ever seen was at all comparable to the "Book of Kildare", every page of which was gorgeously illuminated, and he concludes a most laudatory notice by saying that the interlaced work and the harmony of the colours left the impression that "all this is the work of <a href="01476d.htm">angelic</a>, and not human skill". Small wonder that <a href="06568d.htm">Gerald Barry</a> assumed the book to have been written night after night as St. Bridget <a href="12345b.htm">prayed</a>, "an <a href="01476d.htm">angel</a> furnishing the designs, the scribe copying". Even allowing for the exaggerated stories told of St. Brigid by her numerous biographers, it is <a href="03539b.htm">certain</a> that she ranks as one of the most remarkable Irishwomen of the fifth century and as the Patroness of <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. She is lovingly called the "Queen of the South: the Mary of the Gael" by a writer in the "Leabhar Breac". St. Brigid died leaving a <a href="03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city and <a href="13554b.htm">school</a> that became famous all over <a href="05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In her <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> St. Ultan wrote a <a href="07595a.htm">hymn</a> commencing:</p>

<blockquote><p>Christus in nostra insula <br>Que vocatur Hivernia <br>Ostensus est hominibus <br>Maximis mirabilibus <br>Que perfecit per felicem <br>Celestis vite virginem <br>Precellentem pro merito <br>Magno in numdi circulo.</p> <p>(In our island of Hibernia Christ was made known to man by the very great <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a> which he performed through the <a href="07131b.htm">happy</a> virgin of celestial life, famous for her <a href="10202b.htm">merits</a> through the whole world.)</p></blockquote>

<div class="CMtag_300x250" style="display: flex; height: 300px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; "></div>

<p>The sixth Life of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a> printed by <a href="04099c.htm">Colgan</a> is attributed to Coelan, an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a> of the eighth century, and it derives a peculiar importance from the fact that it is prefaced by a foreword from the pen of St. Donatus, also an <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="10487b.htm">monk</a>, who became <a href="02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="06070a.htm">Fiesole</a> in 824. St. Donatus refers to previous lives by St. Ultan and <a href="01234c.htm">St. Aileran</a>. When dying, St. Brigid was attended by St. Ninnidh, who was ever afterwards known as "Ninnidh of the Clean Hand" because he had his right hand encased with a metal covering to prevent its ever being defiled, after being he medium of administering the <a href="15397c.htm">viaticum</a> to <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland's</a> Patroness. She was <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> at the right of the <a href="07346b.htm">high altar</a> of Kildare Cathedral, and a costly <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> was erected over her. In after years her shrine was an object of veneration for <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, especially on her <a href="06021b.htm">feast day</a>, 1 February, as <a href="04094a.htm">Cogitosus</a> related. About the year 878, owing to the Scandinavian raids, the <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Brigid were taken to Downpatrick, where they were <a href="03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> and <a href="04136a.htm">St. Columba</a>. The <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the three <a href="04171a.htm">saints</a> were discovered in 1185, and on 9 June of the following year were <a href="14133a.htm">solemnly</a> translated to a suitable resting place in Downpatrick Cathedral, in presence of Cardinal Vivian, fifteen <a href="02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and numerous <a href="01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Various Continental <a href="02768b.htm">breviaries</a> of the pre-Reformation period commemorate St. Brigid, and her name is included in a <a href="09286a.htm">litany</a> in the Stowe <a href="10354c.htm">Missal</a>. In <a href="08098b.htm">Ireland</a> today, after 1500 years, the memory of "the Mary of the Gael" is as dear as ever to the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a> heart, and, as is well known, Brigid preponderates as a <a href="15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="10673c.htm">Christian name</a>. Moreover, hundreds of place-names in her <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> are to be found all over the country, e.g. Kilbride, Brideswell, Tubberbride, Templebride, etc. The hand of St. Brigid is preserved at Lumiar near <a href="09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, <a href="12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, since 1587, and another <a href="12734a.htm">relic</a> is at St. Martin's Cologne.</p>

<p>Viewing the biography of St. Brigid from a critical standpoint we must allow a large margin for the vivid Celtic <a href="07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the <a href="06588a.htm">glosses</a> of <a href="10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers, but still the <a href="11727b.htm">personality</a> of the founder of Kildare stands out clearly, and we can with tolerable accuracy trace the leading events in her life, by a careful study of the old "Lives" as found in <a href="04099c.htm">Colgan</a>. It seems certain that Faughart, associated with memories of Queen Meave (Medhbh), was the scene of her birth; and Faughart Church was founded by St. Morienna in <a href="07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Brigid. The old well of St. Brigid's adjoining the ruined church is of the most venerable antiquity, and still attracts <a href="12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>; in the immediate vicinity is the ancient mote of Faughart. As to St. Brigid's stay in Connacht, especially in the County Roscommon, there is ample evidence in the "Trias Thaumaturga", as also in the many <a href="03041a.htm">churches</a> founded by her in the Diocese of Elphim. Her friendship with <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> is attested by the following paragraph from the "Book of Armagh", a precious <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the eighth century, the <a href="02137a.htm">authenticity</a> of which is beyond question: "inter sanctum Patricium Brigitanque Hibernesium columpnas amicitia caritatis inerat tanta, ut unum cor consiliumque haberent unum. Christus per illum illamque virtutes multas peregit". (Between <a href="11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> and St. Brigid, the columns of the <a href="08098b.htm">Irish</a>, there was so great a friendship of charity that they had but one heart and one mind. Through him and through her Christ performed many <a href="10338a.htm">miracles</a>.) At Armagh there was a "Templum Brigidis"; namely the little <a href="01010a.htm">abbey</a> church known as "Regles Brigid", which contained some <a href="12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="04171a.htm">saint</a>, destroyed in 1179, by William Fitz Aldelm. It may be added that the original <a href="09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of <a href="04094a.htm">Cogitosus's</a> "Life of Brigid", or the "Second Life", dating from the closing years of the eighth century, is now in the <a href="12354c.htm">Dominican</a> friary at <a href="05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a> in <a href="02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.</p>
